Following our remarks we will take questions. Now I will take the – I will turn the call over to Extreme's President and CEO, Ed Meyercord.\nEd Meyercord: Thank you, Stan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our second quarter results were in line with our previously announced revised Q2 outlook. We did have some highlights in the quarter. SaaS ARR grew 37%, which reinforces the value of our differentiated cloud platform. We have 44 customers who spent over $1 million on Extreme Solutions demonstrating both customer retention and our ability to take new logos from our larger competitors and gross profit is 62.5% showing continued improvements and the benefit of a higher mix of high margin recurring revenue. At a high level, the networking industry is exiting the final stage of the COVID-induced era of supply chain constraints, which has significantly impacted our business. We've made the conscious decision to put channel digestion behind us in the March quarter. Our distributors and partners have lowered inventory purchases, which we expect to accelerate in the third quarter. We expect to emerge in the fourth quarter at a much more normalized level of revenue and earnings. Our bookings trends and funnel of new opportunities are strong indicators of customer demand. While larger deals are still experiencing elongated sales cycles, particularly in North America, we continue to win against the competition on a bookings basis, with an uptick in new logos. Our EMEA business has stabilized and grew from the prior year and APAC bookings continue to grow over the prior year. In addition to sequential and year-on-year funnel growth, we grew the number of transacting partners accounts and deal volume during the quarter. These trends and the expanded go-to-market opportunities give us confidence that we are positioned for a return to meaningful growth of fiscal ‘25. We've attracted a growing list of 14 managed service provider partners exiting the second quarter with seven already driving transactions. We're positioned to expand our MSP footprint as partners are drawn to the simplicity of One Cloud, the flexibility of our unified hardware, and our unique consumption billing model. We make it simple for these service providers to deliver seamless, high-quality networking experience to their customers. We've also made inroads establishing a private subscription offer through a highly-targeted list of large service providers, as noted at our November Investor Day this market segment opens a $5 billion addressable market. In November, we introduced Extreme Cloud Universal ZTNA, the first network security offering to integrate network application and device access within a single solution. This helps move organizations to a zero trust policy for all devices across the network. This, combined with our industry-leading campus fabric solution, extends our value proposition in helping customers both manage and secure their networks. Yesterday, we launched new Wi-Fi 7 access points and the 4000 Series Universal Switches designed to help highly distributed enterprise organizations, create improved network connectivity, security and application performance. Both of these new cloud-managed platforms leverage AI-ops and machine learning to deliver faster remediation and enhance network visibility. These new products also integrate well with ExtremeCloud Universal ZTNA to enhance network security posture. The integration of AI, security and analytics into a single platform is a key differentiator for Extreme as it allows us to bring greater simplicity and flexibility for customers. This is why we continue to enlarge deals with manufacturers, like, LG Energy Solutions, leading healthcare facilities like NHS Trust Hospitals in the UK, educational institutions like, London South Bank University, Leeds Beckett and Kingston Universities, and large venues, like, Wells Fargo Center and Canada Life Centre. I've made previously announced leadership changes to streamline and strengthen our go-to-market capabilities. Earlier this month, Norman Rice was appointed as our Chief Commercial Officer and is now focused on driving revenue growth and leading the company's sales, partner, and services organizations. He's successfully built our go-to-market sales motions in stadiums and venues, driving large opportunities with Verizon and Kroger, and has been at the forefront of driving our new commercial opportunities with large service providers. He has valuable experience managing revenue operations with deep knowledge of our complex supply chain environment. Our Chief Product and Technology Officer, Nabil Bukhari is focused on increasing our SaaS revenue, in his newly mentioned role as our GM of our Subscription business. We've also deepened our bench of SaaS expertise on the executive team over the past six months with the additions of our new Chief Marketing Officer, Monica Kumar in December; and CFO Kevin Rhodes last May. The alignment of the team is crucial to helping accelerate growth and capture more share. The Extreme brand continues to get elevated in the marketplace through our customer wins and differentiated technology that creates more simplicity and flexibility across complex networking environments. Our promise of One Network, One Cloud remains a competitive differentiator. One Network is underpinned by our universal hardware highlighted by campus fabric, which has unparalleled campus security benefits and allows users to segment networks 10 times faster than any competitor. One Cloud offers customers modern networking tools with built-in AI-ops. And we're unique because we're the only provider to offer cloud choice whether that's public, private, hybrid or edge. We're winning deals based on helping customers find new ways to deliver better outcomes such as increased IT productivity, reduced OpEx or securing their business. The simplicity and flexibility of One Network, One Cloud remains a competitive differentiator, particularly in a time when major competitors have created complexity with disjointed solutions, and uncertainty in their long-term rationalization of products and solutions. We remain the only pure play networking company with a differentiated and integrated portfolio and a clear roadmap. We believe our exposure to the fastest-growing areas of the networking market, share gains and new go-to-market partnerships provide ample growth opportunities to drive double-digit growth in the long-term. We're forecasting market share gains with targeted partners leveraging the strength of our unique solutions for the enterprise. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Kevin Rhodes to walk us through the results and guidance.\nKevin Rhodes: Thanks, Ed. Despite lower revenue in the second quarter, we improved our gross margins sequentially, and optimized our operating expenses to maintain a healthy operating margin profile. Our EPS was therefore impacted less than our revenue shortfall end of quarter. In the second quarter, we took proactive action that enabled us to protect our profitability, while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. We will continue to focus on aligning our cost structure accordingly, as we navigate the second half of our fiscal year. Let me get into the numbers. Second quarter revenue of $296.4 million, fell 7% year-over-year and was in line with our revised outlook. Product revenue of $186.6 million, fell 16.5% year-over-year, reflecting continued channel digestion and elongated sale cycles that are impacting the networking industry. These trends are consistent across both switching and wireless products. Our product backlog has normalized this quarter earlier than we initially anticipated and our bookings approximated our product revenue for the first time in four quarters. In fact, our bookings trends were positive in both EMEA and APAC where each grew double-digits year-over-year. From a vertical perspective, while total bookings fell slightly both quarter-over-quarter and from the prior year, our healthcare, education, manufacturing, and transportation/logistics vertical markets grew from the prior year. We are encouraged by this level of customer activity which informs our view that we will be able to get channel digestion phase behind us as quickly as possible. SaaS ARR and recurring revenue was a bright spot in our quarter. SaaS ARR grew 37% year-over-year to $158 million, driven by the strength of our renewals and activations of previously shipped products. Subscription deferred revenue was up 32% year-over-year to $246 million. As we ship products and backlog, it's generating a tailwind for SaaS growth. Total subscription and support revenue was $110 million, up 16% year-over-year. This growth was largely driven by the strength of our Cloud subscription revenue, up 39% year-over-year. Recurring revenue continues to be a positive at Extreme. Total recurring revenue of $101 million grew 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, to now 34% of total revenue. Based on our current outlook, we expect recurring revenue to account for approximately 35% of the full fiscal 2024 year revenue. The growth of cloud subscriptions and maintenance drove the total deferred revenue to $549 million, up 23% year-over-year, and 5% sequentially. Gross margin was 62.5% up 140 basis points from the prior quarter and up 400 basis points compared to the prior year ago quarter. This is the third quarter in a row that we've achieved 60% plus gross margin, which is proven to be an achievable level for Extreme at normalized scale. We attribute this to improvements and mix due to the higher contribution of subscription and support revenue, and an improvement in supply chain and distribution related cost. Our second quarter operating expenses were $141 million down $12 million from a $153 million in the first quarter, and up slightly from $139 million in the year ago quarter. We plan to take additional actions to further optimize our operating expenses to the level of revenue we expect to achieve in the second half of fiscal 2024, in order to preserve our margin structure in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2025. Operating margin for the second quarter was 14.8%, down from 17.7% and similar to 14.9% in the prior year quarter. This is the sixth quarter in a row of double-digit operating margins, also an achievable level for the company at normalized scale. All-in second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.24, down from $0.25 in the first quarter and $0.27 in the year-ago quarter. We finished the quarter with $221 million in cash and net cash of $26 million after repurchasing another $25 million of our shares. We've repurchased $153 million worth of our shares over the past five quarters. The $28.6 million of free cash flow we generated in the quarter was impacted by lower revenue and the use of working capital for purchases of raw materials and inventory, based on our prior year purchase commitments. We expected recovery in cash flow as revenue recovers and component purchases become more balanced with normalized sell-through rates. Now turning to guidance. This quarter, we expect sell-through to be significantly higher than sell-in, which we believe will have a meaningful impact on our operating results. To quantify this impact, we expect a $40 million to $50 million reduction in channel inventory in the third quarter, which will allow us to cover to a more normalized level of revenue in the fourth quarter. As a result, we plan to take further cost actions to drive the recovery in earnings per share and cash flow. Heading into the fourth quarter, we are expecting improved sequential revenue growth based on our funnel and the seasonality of our business led by our education vertical. We believe our proactive approach to managing through this industry challenge will enable us to deliver improved growth and profitability in fiscal year 2025. For the third quarter, we expect as follows: revenue to be in a range of $200 million to $210 million; gross margin to be in a range of 59.5% to 61.5%; operating loss to be in a range of 12.4% to 8.8%; and loss per basic share in the range of $0.22 to $0.17. A basic share count is expected to be around 129 million shares. Looking further ahead into our fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in a range of $265 million to $275 million, gross margins to be flat to slightly up from the third quarter, non-GAAP operating margin to be in a range of 10% to 13%, GAAP operating margin to be 1% to 4%, and fully diluted share count of 131 million to 132 million shares. With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street Capital Market. Your line is open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yeah. I wanted to address the leadership change here and the -- how we're going to be approaching the channel differently than we were before. If you could talk a little bit about what Norman Rice is going to be doing? I guess, we sort of lost touch with the channel demand, those are my words not yours, but what are we doing to help improve that channel monitoring? What processes or is Norman putting in place?\nEd Meyercord: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Eric. One of the first things that Norman has done and with our leadership teams is to stratify our customer base and to split out what is more run rate business in terms of business that's less than 50,000 in order and what that business looks like which is going to be more channel driven and can be impacted more through distributors and marketing activities and to provide more clarity to the project-based business and stratifying that project based business. And I'd say that's a big change that Norman's bringing to the equation. The other thing that I'll mention is that Norman and Kevin, where the architects behind our private subscription offer, which is a channel led initiative that we believe will be disruptive. There's a lot of demand with some of the larger service providers that we're working with, that's building up, and I think you'll start to see and we'll be in a position to announce meaningful deals in the second half of this year. And I also mentioned earlier in my comments about the managed services provider partners that we have who are signing up and it's -- there's the portfolio benefits and our technology benefits along with the unique capability that people are very interested in which is our consumption billing model, which provides for a lot of efficiency for that, that go-to-market motion. So it's the stratification of the opportunities and I'd say a more highly targeted approach to the channel to the core business, along with these targeted new commercial models that we're going to market with. And Norman is very well. He's the best qualified person to lead us on that front.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. And then looking at the guidance here, just a really dramatic reset, I'm wondering was there a prior year outlook because we had a guidance reset coming out of Q1 and now, we've had an even more dramatic reset coming out of Q2. What's the confidence level here? We've got one month under our belts for Q3. Are we seeing any evidence to say things are getting better as far as the sequential step up in Q4.\nEd Meyercord: Yeah, Eric. We commented on the funnel and opportunities specifically, commenting on progress that we've seen in EMEA, in Asia-Pacific, and Kevin also touched on the fact that we're heading into E-Rate season and this looks to be a pretty strong E-Rate season for us. The declines came as we were looking into Q2. Our outlook for Q2 and our plans to take down channel inventory that the reality is, we couldn't take inventory down nearly as much as that we had intended and I would say with the elongated sales cycles and with bookings pushing out the way they did, it only deepened our position in the channel. And we had to make a decision as to whether or not we want to manage this out over time or take it all in one fell swoop. And our view and our perspective is to get it cleaned up and get normalized as we head into Q4 and turn the corner on ‘25. And that’s how we've made the decision that we're making. Demand is obviously going to be masked by inventory flowing out of the channel, and that's a $40 million to $50 million number that you heard Kevin talk about. And as we go into Q4, we do have seasonality and we are expecting more neat normal seasonality as we go into that quarter and we have the E-Rate business and we have a significantly larger funnel and that's what gives us confidence. So we're very focused on the cleanup here this quarter and then delivering and exceeding our outlook for the June quarter.\nEric Martinuzzi: Thanks for taking my questions.\nEd Meyercord: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks guys. Can you just talk about maybe the end user demand? Are customers may be waiting for Wi-Fi 7 or CBRS or further upgrades to Cloud? Just any color what's going on because the step down next quarter's guidance versus what you were thinking six months ago is incredibly dramatic. The channel numbers that you just gave seems only tell part of the story. Thanks.\nEd Meyercord: Yeah, Tim. I think that's -- you're seeing a much more conservative outlook as it relates to demand. Yes, in some cases in the Wi-Fi market there will be some people that are holding off for Wi-Fi 7. We've talked about elongated sales cycles which has been very real in the U.S. where we've had verbal commitments for pretty exciting wins for extreme, but the deals themselves have been pushed out and when we look at deals in our funnel that get to the commit level. We close on those deals it's more of a function of time, so we're looking at this as timing, if you look at and this is why we're providing guidance for Q4, we're confident in the guide and how we're going to come out of this in Q4, but we are setting that base level at a more conservative level than we had in the past. And I'd say, Tim, to your point, I think we're feeling a little bit burned in terms of what we were expecting to close in the funnel. And we've gone back and taken a fresh view of that. And our view is to put it behind us and reset here with a clean path going forward. As we look into fiscal ‘25, there will be some tough comps if we look at the Q1 and Q2, but as we get into calendar ‘25 we see ourselves on a really nice and a very strong footing for driving double-digit growth and resuming where we left off.\nTimothy Horan: And so Wi-Fi 7, can you maybe just talk about how much of an improvement it is, for the customers or your benefits and maybe how does the pricing of the product look like your ability to supply it? And then just lastly on Wi-Fi 7 and it is -- what the competitive environment looks like? And do you think this is one of the things kind of driving the elongated sales cycles are customers waiting for this?\nEd Meyercord: Yeah. I mean I think it's fair to say that, that there are going to be some customers in the marketplace that are waiting on this. The benefit that you have in Wi-Fi 7 is you have -- the different frequency bands and you have, in our case, higher bandwidth, which is important. And then, we're also bringing dual bands in terms of speeds and so there's a lot more flexibility in the solution. So every time you have these upgrades there's higher quality in terms of connectivity. In this case, there's more bandwidth, there's more flexibility in terms of end-user devices that we pick up on different frequencies. And then we have the dual bandwidth capabilities in terms of how we connect to the network. The Wi-Fi 7 for us is cloud managed in addition to our 4000 series switch, which is purely a cloud managed and in this we're bringing some unique capabilities that provide a lot of advantages in terms of how to deploy and run networks, relative to the traditional CLI model where provisioning and network deployments can be done in a much more efficient fashion and a more automated way. So yeah, there are a lot of benefits in what's coming out and our most recent releases. And yeah, in terms of opportunities, it could have an impact.\nTimothy Horan: And when does it start shipping at scale?\nEd Meyercord: We are GA at this point. So I think you would expect to see shipping from Wi-Fi 7 beginning in Q3 and really ramp up -- and begin to ramp in Q4.\nTimothy Horan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. .\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys for taking my questions. Maybe to start on the competitive landscape and that dynamic, I think you guys spent a lot of time talking about that taking sort of the inventory, de-stocking, pained short-term. But you also talked about normal seasonality in Q4, talking about gaining share over the long-term. Can you maybe just kind of talk about what you're seeing competitively in the market today that gives you confidence that we can get back to share gains over the intermediate and longer term? And then I have a follow up question as well.\nEd Meyercord: Yeah, Dave. Thanks. So I'll comment on that. What gives us confidence is what we see happening in the market every day. And we've talked about the largest competitor in the space that has a very different cloud solution. And we continue to see the industry moving to cloud and we have a leadership position in cloud. So the largest player in the marketplace has got a very different cloud solution from the traditional enterprise solution. In addition to that, they continue to invest in other markets. And so the level of complexity that we're feeling in the marketplace surrounding the largest competitor is very real and opens up a lot of opportunities. We've talked about some of the larger deals that we're getting into. We continue to move up market and you'll see us continuing to do this with some of the announcements that will come out of Extreme, where in these highly competitive and highly contested processes, we're coming out on top. And so you're seeing the likes of Cisco and HPE and Juniper getting pushed back and Extreme winning and that's part of how we're upleveling our brand. So that's one of the ways that we have confidence relative to the largest player. Everyone is very top of mind. The HP acquisition of Juniper. What that will mean. In our case, it means that one of our competitors will be going away. We see a lot of opportunities certainly over the next couple of years. They're looking to rationalize their product portfolios. This is going to create opportunities. In fact, it already has, where we're already getting calls from customers, direct customers, and end users in the field, as well as partners who are concerned and very unsure about what does that product roadmap look like and what is it going to look like. And this gives us, these just create, they create more opportunities for us.\nDavid Vogt: No. Great. That’s helpful. And maybe just a follow up. You talked about a strong E-Rates easing coming up and getting back to hopefully some degree of normal seasonality by the June quarter. Recognizing that obviously the first half of fiscal ’25 difficult comps on a year-over-year basis. Are you planning for what I would consider to be more normal seasonal behavior on a quarter-over-quarter basis as we get through June going forward or is there still some digestion from whether it's order growth intake, underlying demand/channel digestion that we should expect as we go through the second half of this calendar year into ‘25? And then, just maybe one final one for Kevin if I could slip it in there. You mentioned, obviously, double-digit margins at normalized scale, I think the phrase was. We just want to get some more color on how we're thinking about it, because I know at the Analyst Day, obviously you guys had talked about margins above, let's call it, fiscal ‘22 levels back into mid-teens, but just wanted to get more color on what scale do you need to get to you to get back to margins that are more robust than, let's say, fiscal ’22?\nEd Meyercord: And I'll cover the first part of the question and Kevin I'll let you jump in and cover the second part. We're looking, I think at – yes, more traditional seasonality as you look at the shifts going from Q1 -- Q4 into Q1 to Q2 etc. I think in the core business, the outlier here is going to be some of the new commercial motions that we have that are not likely to be in the same seasonal patterns. So some of the larger deals that traditionally we would not have access to in terms of our private subscription offer for example are not necessarily going to fall into that the traditional seasonal lower the core business. And I'd say the same thing is true with our MSP business is that ramps That's just going to be more of a steady incline than it will be kind of traditional seasonal business. Kevin, do you want to comment on the second part of the question?\nKevin Rhodes: Sure. Absolutely happy to. The reason why we gave the fourth quarter outlook is to actually show what we believe will be a more normalized. We do believe we will grow off of Q4, so we're not thinking that, that is like the new number forever because we have these opportunities with MSP and ESPO that will continue to mature and provide further growth in the future. But with Q4 being 10% to 13%, we believe that's a good jumping off point. But we will maintain operating margins in the double-digits throughout this fourth quarter and throughout next year is our plan. In terms of like, how much we can scale from where we were in ‘23 or ’24 in the future, we really have to go and spend a little bit more time looking at where our ’25, ‘26 contributions are going to be to get into that, that the higher realms of mid-teens to high-teens, even to 20% scale beyond that, but we do think it's possible. I mean, we're already showing the discipline that if we need to, we could take costs out of the business to drive and keep our margins at that double-digit level. And what we need to do is, we are focused on that is to continue to scale and grow the business and generate more profitability over time and that's exactly what Ed and I are intending to do is to continue to scale the operating margins over time.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question coming from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.\nChristian Schwab: Hey. Good morning, guys. So Ed, now that it's become evident of over earning during supply chain issues, etc., etc., and competitors not having products. When we look at your business and we baseline modest growth before we entered this period and I kind of come up with a number of about $1.1 billion plus or minus is that kind of what you believe the business we're going to be below that run rate, march little bit of above that or kind of in that light and June is – is that kind of our starting from your top line growth initiatives, is that fair or is that, that the way you think about it all?\nEd Meyercord: I think, it's fair. We are going to build out of this. And yeah, what we've said is, and Christian, we use the language kind of more normalized to comment on the June quarter and when you just kind of run the math on some growth on that kind of baseline business, you get to the 1.1. So I think that's a fair assessment. Kevin, I don't know, if you want to add to that or comments.\nKevin Rhodes: No. I think you are right, Ed. I mean, with Q4 being at that level and jumping off point there with it being the new normal would continue. We do believe that we will continue to grow the business. We will have a better growth story in the second half of our fiscal year ‘25 than the first half. But in general, yeah, in terms of range $1.1 billion is the new normal about right?\nChristian Schwab: Is Norman's work doing anything about moving to selling product as a service across the board and putting a mechanism in place to be more aggressive in that or is that something you're going to watch some of the other people in the industry do to see if there's a tremendous customer interest?\nEd Meyercord: Yeah. I think you're going to see us be a lot more aggressive and we've -- I mentioned that the triumvirate of Norman stepping in and taking the lead as Chief Commercial Officer. Nabil is our Chief Technology and Chief Product Officer, but he's also running a cross-functional team on SaaS and subscription. And one of the things that you're seeing is really nice growth on the subscription line and really healthy margins on that subscription business. And so as we think about growth we have plans to continue that growth on the subscription line. Also, we have the benefit of gross margins on that. Finally, we made a key hire, Monica Kumar who's come and joined us. I think she's going to be the glue between, our product orgs and our selling orgs and I think we have an opportunity to be much more targeted and I would say much more aggressive in direct outreach to the market more broadly as well as more targeted with the channel, and we have some really interesting growth opportunities in the channel. So, I think this represents a unique opportunity for Extreme to really step up in the marketplace and that's how we see it.\nChristian Schwab: My last question deal with the recent consolidation in this space, you did a big consolidation years ago and extremely confused your customer base about which products you were going to support and which products you were not going to support. So I think with that as a backdrop should set you up to be well positioned to take advantage of what could be potential confusion in the marketplace. Do you think that that will help be a competitive advantage for you to gain share?\nEd Meyercord: We do. It looks like, from the announcement, it looks like HP was very interested in the AI platform that Juniper brings to the equation and that Juniper leadership will be heading the networking side. What does that mean to the massive install base of Aruba and Aruba Technology. It raises a lot of questions And for customers, it raises an awful lot of questions. And keep in mind, Juniper has come at enterprise really from the service provider position. And so in terms of the breadth of their portfolio, they are still miss (ph) this very much kind of driving the efforts. And in terms of the full end-to-end enterprise solution, it's not as robust. And so how that incorporates and how that gets built into the Aruba enterprise solution set, there are a lot of questions out there, and I think that's going to create opportunities for us. And we're very focused on a very clean and simple and flexible solution in terms of our universal hardware, in terms of interfacing with One Cloud. This presents a very fresh alternative and a very clean alternative for customers that are out there. The other thing that you're aware of Christian from our prior M&A activities is that they baked a lot of synergy into the formula. And when you look at $430 million, $450 million of expense coming out of the business, you're talking about thousands of people coming out of that business, and where they come from, and how that plays out again will create disruption. and as I mentioned earlier, we've gotten calls from, we're already getting calls from employees and customers and partners, so we think this will present opportunities potentially hiring opportunities and new growth opportunities for us.\nChristian Schwab: Great. No other questions. Thank you.\nEd Meyercord: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open.\nDave Kang: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is regarding bookings. You reported that Asia and Europe were up double-digits year-over-year, just wondering, if you can provide any color on North America bookings?\nEd Meyercord: I mean the color is, I'd say that's, that's the area where we've been challenged Dave. In terms of the bookings, we were close to a book-to-bill ratio of 1 in the quarter so that was a positive news, but North America was down year-over-year.\nDave Kang: Got it. And then, so sounds like the fiscal third quarter, most of the inventory -- excess inventories will be flushed out. So can we expect fiscal fourth quarter to be sort of like a clean channel inventory.\nEd Meyercord: Yes. That's exactly our intent is to get it cleaned and to have, get normalized in the fourth quarter and beyond.\nDave Kang: So sounds like...\nKevin Rhodes: Yeah. I would just add. We look at obviously normalized backlog has happened quickly and more quickly than originally anticipated and as we look at entering Q4 we look at normalized backlog and normalized channel inventory. So somewhat of a clean slate is, we head into Q4 and turn the quarter into to fiscal ’25.\nDave Kang: And based on your fiscal fourth quarter guide -- revenue guide you're implying that orders will be up significantly sequentially from third to fourth quarter, correct?\nEd Meyercord: Yeah. We've got the E-Rate season there. We mentioned that earlier. So we are expecting sequential growth. A, our two strongest quarters in a year are the fourth quarter and the -- second and fourth quarter of our fiscal year. So as we think about the June quarter, you got the E-Rate season there. They've got a stronger pipeline than we have in the third quarter here, and we've got strong E-Rate season coming at us. So we are expecting sequential growth in bookings.\nDave Kang: My last question is, Ed, you mentioned that fiscal ‘25, you're expecting meaningful growth. Just wondering, if you can kind of provide additional color. Should we expect like double-digits? Would that be meaningful?\nEd Meyercord: That's correct and that's how we're thinking about it, David. So we looked at that, there's going to be a tough comp in the first quarter, given that we landed it 353 last year, or this, for Q1 of this year. Then, I think you get to the second half as we turn the corner into calendar ‘25. Obviously, we'll have a very much easier comp in Q3. But we expect that our marketing initiatives, our go-to-market initiatives in terms of the core business and then the realization of these new commercial models that are growing, that they haven't really had an impact on our financials yet, that by the time we get to that calendar ‘25 timeframe. You'll start to see a much more meaningful impact of those initiatives coming into play and adding to growth over just what we would consider to be kind of core market growth.\nDave Kang: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: So your commentary about $1.1 billion being the run rate revenue number and the guide for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year at 265 to 275 is more normalized. It is a little bit troubling considering in the fourth quarter of 2019, you did $252 million and for the full year 2019, you did roughly $1 billion at $995.8 million and that's 2019 that would put a growth rate to your normalized $1.1 billion of around 2.5% over that time frame. And certainly, you would not say that's a reasonable growth rate. So the question, I have for you is, what is the real normalized number if you were to adjust these numbers to fully normalize the baseline, you say $1.1 billion is normalized but I don't think you believe your 2.5% growth company. So can you please adjust that language a little bit for us, in terms of understanding how much the fourth quarter is still unnormalized as opposed to more normalized? And what would be the run rate of revenue if you had a fully normalized full year? Thank you.\nEd Meyercord: Yeah, Alex. So let me, Kevin, just hit a high level, and then I'll let you come in and fill in. But Alex, we're – obviously, it's a pretty massive reset here in our Q3 with a lot of cleanup involved. We have new teams and we have a new approach that are coming in and looking to sort of build off of a base in resetting the foundation, whether or not it would be normal seasonality going into Q1, or is there still conservatism in that, that Q4 number where you could still see some growth -- sequential growth coming out of that. We wanted to provide the outlook for the -- our fiscal Q4 to provide again what we're calling more normalized. Will that be a fully more normalized bookings number? There I think we need some work on that and we'll definitely be coming back to you with a more refined outlook on how we see the evolution of booking especially considering these other commercial models which quite frankly we have not included in our outlook.\nKevin Rhodes: I think that's the key, as I think that the MST model is very nascent very early to ESPO model we have as well the private subscription offers also very early at stages. This is based on the run rate of the existing business and products that we've got ZTNA coming on board, we've got Wi-Fi 7 coming on board, we've got new products, innovations coming out. That will continue to give us that tailwind in the future. Right now, we're just not prepared to go and guide for 2025 or beyond, but wanted to give at least a normalized Q4 at this point.\nEd Meyercord: And Alex, the other comment to make is that we have seen -- earlier we saw Asia-Pacific recovering more quickly. And then, we've seen EMEA come with year-over-year growth that Kevin mentioned. And we just -- we haven't seen it yet in the Americas. And so the timing of that America's recovery to the normal buying cycle and how all of that kicks in from a timing perspective. And we have a lot of large deals that are in the hopper for us. Really exciting from a brand perspective in terms of where we are in these competitive processes. But they're very lumpy, and I think it's a little challenging for the team right now to stick their necks out and call some of these larger deals. If that makes sense.\nAlex Henderson: That's not my problem. My problem is the guide commentary that normalized full year revenue run rate would be at $1.1 billion, which is obviously still incorporating a significant amount of backlog adjustment and the comment that more normalized implies that it's almost normal and it's certainly not in the fourth quarter, so what is the nut that you're assuming for the fourth quarter? What would be fully normalized fourth quarter? You mean can you give us some sense of what more normalized means in terms of the scaling of it?\nEd Meyercord: Yeah. I mean I'm not sure we're there, I'm not sure we're there yet. I mean if we look at a 275 number. Yeah, if we look at a 275 number in Q4 and obviously, there's the math to get to 1.1 when you just roll that over. So there's not, I guess you would say there's not a lot of growth built into that for a normalized fiscal ‘25, Alex.\nAlex Henderson: Well, I mean, you did 253 in fourth quarter of 2019, and now you're telling me 275 is close to normalized? Difficult trying to reconcile those two numbers. Not even close to normalized in that context, so how big is the nut? Are we still absorbing $30 million, $40 million in the June quarter of inventory absorption?\nKevin Rhodes: Yeah, Alex. The thing that you're missing I think is the North America is still recovering. It was down year-over-year.\nAlex Henderson: I'm not missing anything, I'm asking what the nut is that you're assuming when you give us the guidance for the fourth quarter in terms of the absorption in the recovery in the environment. How big is that nut?\nKevin Rhodes: We're assuming no incremental amount as you say nuts in the fourth quarter. We assume absorption will occur in the third quarter with no more absorption needed in the fourth quarter. What we need to see is, we need to see the market, the entire market is down right now, this is not just an Extreme issue, this is an exogenous issue that's across all IT and all networking. And so where we see and where we hope is that the market starts to come back. And that we will see the North American market come back. And appreciate your points, but we got to get the whole market to come back and spend across the board to help.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thanks.\nKevin Rhodes: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Meyercord for any closing remarks.\nEd Meyercord: Okay. Thank you. Thank you everybody for participating in the call and obviously, we'll have call backs of many of you, and we appreciate all the good questions. I also want to take time to thank our employees and customers and partners who are participating here and for all the work as we're transitioning through this cycle and putting ourselves on more normalized footing as we've been talking about. We are absolutely looking forward to putting this chapter behind us. And we're committed to innovating in the industry and continuing to deliver new solutions, and we're committed to these strategic initiatives that will drive long-term growth for us at Extreme. Thanks everybody and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does [indiscernible] conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Following our prepared remarks we will take questions. And now I will take the – I will turn the call over to Extreme's President and CEO, Ed Meyercord.\nEd Meyercord: Thanks, Stan, and thanks to all for joining us this morning. Extreme delivered another strong quarter with revenue growth of 19% and EPS growth of 75%. We continue to move upmarket and the dollar value of deals over $1 million continue to grow quarter-over-quarter. Cloud adoption remains strong on 30% year-over-year ARR growth to $141 million, and SaaS deferred revenue grew 38% year-over-year. Customer retention metrics remain high, a testament to our customers' loyalty and preference for our industry-leading solutions. We outpaced overall market growth in the quarter and expect continued share gains in fiscal 2024 in our core business. Our new go-to-market initiatives outperformed in the quarter as well. This includes expansion across APAC, certifications in regulated industries like state and federal government, the addition of seven new managed service providers, and a new disruptive whitespace opportunity to sell the enterprise to large service providers with a private subscription offer. In addition, we have a plan to license all network devices connected to our evolving ExtremeCloud platform. This will deliver even greater simplicity, value, and flexibility beyond the cloud management capabilities we offer today and create more stickiness for our SaaS business. Our strategic initiatives around differentiated zero-trust posture, expanded machine learning and AI capabilities are expected to drive expansion, ARR growth, and average revenue per user. At the end of fiscal Q1, we felt the impact of the macro environment trends in our industry and lowered our outlook for near-term top-line growth. The higher interest rate environment and economic challenges in some of our larger markets, like Germany, lengthened sales cycles and pushed out a larger amount of end-of-quarter orders in Q1 than we would normally expect. Our channel partners are digesting a large volume of backlog release and focusing on network deployment, slowing down their current ordering. And as a result, we don't expect run rate business to ramp as quickly as anticipated. In light of what we would call an air pocket of demand and decision-making, leading to our revised growth outlook for the year, we took immediate action to realign resources to drive higher productivity and profitability. As a result, we continue to expect high teens operating margin in fiscal 2024. That will allow us to grow our EPS by over 25% during the year. Our funnel of opportunities continues to grow up double digits on a year-over-year basis as our underlying business and competitive position remain strong. Over the long-term, we expect to return to a mid-teens top-line growth outlook and a mid-20s operating margin. And here's why. Customers tell us they're tired of complexity, inflexibility, and the high costs associated with the old networking models from the larger networking companies. They choose Extreme because we set the bar for modern networking with a combination of innovative and flexible technology, licensing and deployment simplicity, and a focus on driving impactful business outcomes. Customers view their network as a strategic asset to enhance operations, power and scale new services, and reduce business risk, especially cyber security risk. Our customers choose Extreme for three primary reasons. First is operational simplicity. That is driving IT productivity, network availability, ease of use, improving both time to value and total cost of ownership of their networking investment. We're the only networking provider that can deploy campus networking fabrics from our cloud. This makes moves, ads, and changes to networks simple and seamless, allows customers to segment networks, and provides unmatched security and resiliency. While fabrics are common in data center environments, we're the only competitor who can bring these services to the dynamic campus environment orchestrated through our cloud. We create One Network, One Cloud for customers to remove the complexity of managing their entire network infrastructure. Second, we offer unmatched flexibility. We offer cloud choice, public, private, hybrid, and edge cloud deployments that can be managed through a single interface. Our universal switches offer OS choice and deployment options. We have the industry's simplest licensing. Unlike competitors, we don't require customers to hire full-time employees just to manage licenses. And finally, we're the only networking vendor that can manage a mixed environment without requiring them to rip and replace all their infrastructure at once as they modernize. Third, our cloud solutions offer actionable business insights, security scale, and innovative technologies such as AIOps and automation. Our AIOps solution now cover over 200,000 devices and are gaining traction with large customers as they look for new ways to leverage the network to drive better business outcomes. With our Digital Twin technology, customers can stage and test their network deployment in a digital environment, saving months of actual physical deployment and troubleshooting time. Our AIOps solutions proactively identify network issues, produce false alarms, and allow IT teams to be proactive instead of reactive. Here are a few examples. We help San Diego Community College connect 80,000 students across multiple campuses with our fabric technology. No other vendor in our industry has the expertise or ability to create a single, secure, hyper-segmented campus network that enables zero-touch provisioning of new locations or moves, ads, and changes to network elements within a matter of minutes. With one network running on one cloud, they decreased OpEx by 50%. Again, none of our competitors can do this. The Dubai World Trade Center recently hosted GITEX, the world's largest technology trade show, which was powered by Extreme's wireless, fabric and cloud solutions. The venue supported more than 180,000 attendees and 6,000 exhibitors at this massive event. They used Extreme Fabric to quickly, simply, and securely segment 3,300 individual networks in a matter of days with an IT staff of two people. Conference attendees thought it was impossible. To accomplish this with our competitors' solution, it would take weeks with a much larger IT team and introduce a significant margin of error due to their complexity. A global leading fast food chain has selected ExtremeCloud SD-WAN to ensure consistent performance and improve guest experiences at its 1,500 locations across the UK. With Extreme, this industry leader has greater visibility across its network and will be able to simplify network management at all locations, increase overall network security, and optimize operations by improving performance for critical applications. These large accounts become important references in brand builders to Extreme. Our increasing pool of large, high-profile customers and our technology differentiation is why we continue to see the value of deals over a million dollars grow each quarter. In Q1, we have more than 30 deals over a million dollars. We continue to have a healthy customer order backlog with clear visibility to order with specific customer request dates through the balance of our fiscal year. This quarter, our product lead times normalized, allowing us to continue working down backlog from product constraints. We continue to expect our backlog to settle in a range of $75 million to $100 million by the end of Q4 fiscal 2024. Next week at our Investor Day, we'll dive into specifics as to why our technology differentiation brings unmatched simplicity, flexibility, and insights that are driving more and more of these high-profile customer wins, and the wins are elevating our brand and driving share gains both in the channel as well as our enterprise customers. We'll also share why we're so excited about new commercial opportunities with our recently launched modern managed services platform, a private subscription offer for very large service providers, our highly targeted certification and security, compliance opportunity, and the elevation of our entire portfolio to subscription licensing. All these factors provide accelerants to the share gains we're driving in our core business. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Rhodes: Thanks, Ed. I'm encouraged not only by our performance in the first quarter, but also our ability to be decisive and take prudent action as we experience shifts in market demand. Let me talk about our first quarter results, and then I'll move to the outlook. In the first quarter, we again demonstrated strong financial and operational performance. We also showed that we remain committed to continuing that level of performance in the future. Let me get into the numbers. First quarter revenue of $353.1 million grew 19% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our expectations entering the quarter. Product revenue of $253.5 million grew 23% year-over-year, reflecting continued improvement in our supply chain environment. We achieved strong double-digit year-over-year growth in campus switching, which grew sequentially as well. SaaS ARR grew 30% year-over-year to $141 million, up from $109 million in the year-ago quarter. Driven by the strength of our renewals, subscription-deferred revenue was up 38% year-over-year to $236 million. Total subscription and support revenue was $99.7 million, up 9% year-over-year. This growth was largely driven by the strength of cloud subscription revenue, up 32% year-over-year. Recurring revenue continues to be a positive story at Extreme. Total recurring revenue of $95 million grew 11% year-over-year, accounting for 27% of overall revenue. Additionally, as we shift products from backlog, it will be a tailwind for our SaaS growth. Based on our current outlook, we expect recurring revenue to be approximately 30% of our revenue for fiscal 2024. The growth of cloud subscriptions and support drove the total deferred revenue to $525 million, up 24% year-over-year. Our gross margin increased once again, achieving 61.1%, as compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter and 57.6% in the year-ago quarter. That's up 90 basis points sequentially and up 350 basis points year-over-year. We attribute our gross margin improvements to the excellent work by our supply chain team, lower overall distribution costs, and a greater mix of high-margin subscription revenue. Our first-quarter operating expenses were $153 million, up from $135 million in the year-ago quarter and down from $156 million in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects increased R&D investment and sales and marketing expenses to support our higher revenue growth plans. Our strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and operating expense management contribute to another increase in our operating margin, now at 17.7%, up from 12.1% in the year-ago quarter and up from 17.4% in the prior quarter. To that end first quarter earnings per share was $0.35 above the high end of our guidance range entering the quarter. We finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $224 million and net cash of $27 million after repurchasing another $25 million worth of shares. We have repurchased $125 million of our shares over the last four quarters and are executing on our commitment to offset dilution from stock awards. We expect our share count to remain relatively flat for the rest of this year. The $71 million that we generated in free cash flow represents a 20% free cash flow margin above the high end of our long-term model, and we also generated $68 million of adjusted EBITDA. Now turning to guidance. We remain optimistic about the enterprise networking spending environment and our ability to take share. However, looking ahead at the balance of fiscal 2024, we are taking a more cautious tone in light of the current spending environment. Based on changing customer buying patterns and macroeconomic conditions, we are tempering our revenue outlook for this quarter and the balance of the year. We do believe that this is an air pocket as opposed to a more systemic issue within our target markets.  For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in a range of $312 million to $327 million. Gross margin to be in a range of 60.2% to 62.2%, operating margin to be in a range of 15.4% to 17.3%, and earnings to be in a range of $0.26 to $0.31 per diluted share on a share count of – 134 million shares. Despite expected near term market conditions and lower revenue expectations for the full year fiscal 2024, we expect mid- to high-single digits of revenue growth, which we believe is above industry growth estimates and implies our share gains will continue. We have also taken recent actions to ensure we align our cost structure with the current level of revenue growth that we expect to achieve. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to deliver strong profitability and improved operating margins during the year. And we expect to generate EPS growth of approximately 25% in fiscal 2024. As Ed noted, we remain committed to long term double digit growth and I see tremendous opportunity for Extreme to grow our business, accelerate our recurring revenue contribution from subscription and support and improve our margins and cash flow. I look forward to laying out some of our long term plans, our new long term plans at our Investor Day next week. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to the operator to begin the Q&A Session.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from David Will [ph] with UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you. This is actually Andrew for David. Wanted to ask you one of the big sort of issues looking at this industry for some time now has been the elevated backlog, certainly you've had it as well. So what I am wondering is maybe you could help us understand a little bit better how much of the sort of mixed signals that the backlog has been sending to the entire industry is driving your slower outlook versus entirely macro? Can you sort of pull that apart for us and help us understand it?\nEd Meyercord: Yes, Andrew, I'll jump in and Kevin, you can follow-up. Andrew, I think when we think about the backlog and you think about what's happened over the course of the last several quarters and it's not just Extreme it's the whole industry, there has been a very high level of backlog release into the channel. And so in terms of how it's affecting current demand, you might say digestion. But effectively we put a lot of product into the channel and so our channel partners are receiving a lot of product and they're moving forward deploying and they're very busy deploying networks. And with that focus on receiving an unusually high amount of product and networking gear, they are really active in deployment mode right now. And I would say – and with some of this, they paused some of their purchasing and some of the drawdown from the channel. So I think that's how that's affecting – that's how you should think about this affecting the current demand equation. As we said, we're calling it an air pocket this will pass as they deploy the networks, they are going to get back to kind of normal course ordering that will be consistent with kind of normal course demand for networking in the industry. Kevin, do you want to add anything to that? I think you hit it, Ed.\nKevin Rhodes: I think you hit all the points.\nEd Meyercord: Okay.\nUnidentified Analyst : And then just my follow-up on that is just obviously you've got backlog working down, you expect it now to normalize in Q4, you've got some very difficult comps in the back half. What is it that gives you the confidence that you're going to see a revenue reacceleration in the back half to hit your fiscal 24 revenue targets? Thanks.\nEd Meyercord: Well, Andrew, it's really about what we see in our funnel. We have a very clear picture of opportunities, and all those opportunities have kind of a timeline next to them. And it's the quality, and the quantity and volume of our funnel that gives us the confidence to make the call. As we turned into Q2, Kevin mentioned that our teams became more cautious with their call. Some of the bookings that we would normally see at the end of the quarter didn't happen. And with the slowdown of sales cycle, people became a lot more cautious about the call here. A lot of those opportunities landed in the second half of the year. These are high quality opportunities and so I would say that's what's driving the confidence interval. Kevin, I'll give you a shot to jump in as well.\nKevin Rhodes: Yes, I mean as we as we think about the quarterly revenue throughout the rest of the year and our guidance for the full year, obviously, Q4 is the toughest comp that we have with the $365 million last year. But we're not calling for accelerating growth over top of that. We think that we're going to hit about mid teens for the full year compared to the full year, 2023.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. Great.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Just a quick clarification on the guide. So, if I were to look at the guide for the upcoming quarter, I assume that the vast majority of the swing is in product sales and that the strength of software growth plus the normal services growth off of lagging product sales would suggest that overall services quarter-to-quarter and for the year would continue to gradually increase over the course of the next three, four quarters. Is that a fair assessment [indiscernible] product sales.\nKevin Rhodes: That's right Alex.\nEd Meyercord: For the most part. Obviously, the attach rate with subscription and support is associated with products. So you'll see a little bit of moderation in the revenue there for subscription and support as it relates to product being lower. But the majority of the reduction in anticipation of revenue for the full year would be on the product side. And that's just literally the digestion issue, the macroeconomic people are just taking longer to make decisions, and decision cycles are lengthening. And we feel like we're in this air pocket where we think we will come out of it. The question is the absorption period, if you will, within the market and when does the macro market come back. I think we're seeing this with many companies across the sector.\nAlex Henderson: Just to be clear, the growth in services is generally driven off the last two years worth of product sales. Therefore, it should continue to increase quarter-to-quarter over the course of the 24 period, even if it's at a very flattish kind of trajectory. So it's almost all in product sales.\nEd Meyercord: That would be our expectation.\nAlex Henderson: Okay, so if that's the case, in order to hit your guidance as given, it sounds like your product sales literally have to be down in the December quarter and essentially flat for the full year, excluding the just printed quarter. Is that also an accurate read? And if that's the case, what is the mechanics underneath the surface between the inventory draw down at your channel versus the sell through? So what does the rate of sell through look like if you were to look at it from the customer perspective as opposed to the two tier channel distribution perspective?\nEd Meyercord: I mean, first of all fourth quarter is a long way away right now. We look at just the pipeline. We've got a combination of backlog that is expected for customer request dates in the fourth quarter, so we have that information. We've got the overall pipeline and we know some of that pipeline relates to existing customers, some of its new logos. We assess that pipeline. Naturally between Q2 and Q3, we'll build more pipeline for Q4. And so I would say we throw that all through the machine and we look at what we think we are going to achieve for the year. And it's up, but it's up on a full year basis. That single to high – mid- to high-single digits for the full year. As it relates to Q4, yes, we've got a tough comp there. As I mentioned, that could be flattish in the fourth quarter, but for the full year, still up.\nAlex Henderson: Yes, the question really was what's the difference between sell through to customers and i.e. what is the underlying customer growth rate in terms of buying product from your channel as opposed to the work down of inventory in your two-tier distribution channel? So, if you were to look underneath the surface here, yes, there's flat product sales, but that is reflective of underlying sell through of what percentage of your revenues coming out of the two-tier distribution. So how much of this is the channel distribution inventory destocking and how much of this is a weakness in underlying demand?\nEd Meyercord: I mean, it's hard to cheese that and pull that apart naturally Alex, we don't have perfect visibility into all that. I would say that our two-tier reseller and distribution program, it's relatively healthy is what I would say. They have got healthy now, fully normalized inventory levels that they have. We don't have too much necessarily in the distribution level and we've got our own healthy amount that we have on our own in warehouse. We're looking at more end customer demand challenges right now. This air pocket is more of an end customer demand. I mean, you got two wars going on right now, et cetera, et cetera. So we're just seeing Europe being this more sluggish, I would say, area of any we commented, particularly in Germany, that's the area that's really I'll call causing the slowdown is mostly in the European area. We're doing well in APAC and U.S. still continues to be strong, but if there is any area, it's that.\nAlex Henderson: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, I was hoping to. Just a clarification first on the guide for FY’24, that mid- to high-single digits, are we talking 4% to 9%?\nKevin Rhodes: I guess you would, yes.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. And then I guess the change in demand environment, it seems like up until about maybe six weeks ago, we were still pretty confidently talking about a mid teens growth rate, not only for FY’24, but for FY’25. Was there a particular event or two that you guys can point back to as the market shifting kind of all at once?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes, Ed, you want to cover that?\nEd Meyercord: Yes. Eric it really happens if you look at the way our business flows from an ordering standpoint and it's the entire industry. There is a build up towards the end of the quarter where most of the orders come in, in the last month of the quarter. And literally, I would say the last two weeks of the quarter when we have a huge pipeline of deals and committed deals, our sellers and then the alarm started coming back that, hey, this is going to push. The decision by – and it's really across geographies, across industries, across verticals, where there was this wave of messaging coming from our field that deals were going to slip and push at an unusually high level. And it caught us off guard because no one really saw that coming. We've heard about it, but that happened. And so it started slipping at the end of the quarter and then as we look forward, our teams just got a lot more cautious with their call, given the environment. And what we're hearing is that there's more scrutiny over budgets, more people are getting involved in the purchasing process. The projects are still good, the projects are still going to happen, maybe there is a prioritization issue that takes place, but you're seeing more purchasing, more financial types a lot of different players come into the decision making process. They just slowed things down. We weren't in a situation where we lost business. We were in a situation where our opportunities just moved out to the right. And that happened literally the last two weeks of the quarter. A lot of those orders don't really affect the quarter because now we're getting close to a point where what we book in a quarter is what we ship. And at the end of the quarter, when orders come in, you don't turn around. That would be kind of more normal backlog with what happens at the end of the quarter. The orders come in and they turn into your revenue and your shipments for the next quarter. And so it was that softness at the very end of the quarter that caused us to look at Q2 to be more cautious and conservative. And our field teams, on the heels of what had happened at the end of the quarter felt they should be more cautious with their calls. So, that’s really – it’s kind of the combination of those two things that happened.\nKevin Rhodes: And Ed, I would even comment that beyond September 30, like even to October, we were still seeing some of the same buying pattern issues in the last 30 days that caused us to also assess what our Q2 revenue would look like leading up to today.\nEric Martinuzzi: Got it. Thanks for taking my question.\nEd Meyercord: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks guys. Ed, when you study past periods of slowdown may be talking to the channel, I mean, in this last six months, 18 months can these networks just run hotter for a little bit longer? And I know you’ve been asked a few times, but can you just maybe give us a rough guesstimate of what percentage of the lower guide comes from just working down inventory at the channel versus end user demand? Just kind of hearing mixed signals. Yes, I know it’s very hard to quantify, but just a little bit more color. Thanks.\nEd Meyercord: Yes. It is hard to quantify Tim. And thanks for the question. And I’ll give an example with some of our largest partners and I’ll use – I’ll pick on EMEA and I’ll pick on Germany specifically. They’re having a fantastic year. They’ve gotten all of this product that’s been released from backlog, and they are solely – they’re focused and super active in deploying networks for their customers on our behalf. They are fully consumed and you see their business is way off year-over-year with us. These are an example of a strategic partner with really healthy business and amazing customers. However, their focus right now is on deploying all that equipment. And so their business is off. They fully expect business to return. And so that’s why, as we look at with our outlook, we know it’s coming back. It’s just – there’s a near term. And we’re calling it an air pocket for the channel to deploy. If I had to put it – if I had to just make up a number and place a guess on how much I would allocate to the slowdown of decision making, more people coming into the decision making process, budgetary constraints, pushing versus channel digestion. Kevin, you can jump in, but if I had to give it a finger, like I’d probably say half and half.\nKevin Rhodes: Yes, I was thinking 60 macro, 40 digestion, but somewhere in that.\nEd Meyercord: Okay. Yes. And Tim, the other piece is there historically has been a run rate business and that run rate business is not insignificant. And we knew that run rate is starting to come back, which is encouraging to us. Our anticipation is that there would be a step function in run rate throughout the course of this fiscal year. And I think it’s – that run rate is happening more slowly. We think that’s also a byproduct of what’s going on in the channel.\nTimothy Horan: Yes, that’s great color. So, I mean, basically you can look at the distribution is full out at this point. They can’t handle any more capacity is maybe half to slow down…\nEd Meyercord: There’s the distribution side, okay, and distribution has inventory, and then, there are channel partners themselves and they’re busy and they’re saying, okay, distributors don’t ship me that product yet because I need to finish this project, and then I’ll take delivery for the next project. So the – and that slows down distributor buying as well because they’re waiting for what we call POS. But they’re waiting for our channel partners to draw down on their inventory. So it’s kind of, it’s just gotten backed up a little bit which is why we’re calling it digestion, but it will pass.\nTimothy Horan: Very helpful. Thank you.\nEd Meyercord: And I was thinking we’ve been here before. We’ve seen this happen before. It’s a quarter – a quarter two, a few quarter phenomenon, but it will pass. We’ve factored all this into our revised outlook for the year and for the quarter.\nTimothy Horan: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open.\nDave Kang: Thank you. Good morning. I may have missed it, but were product orders up or down or any color on that?\nKevin Rhodes: So Dave, we haven’t really quoted any dollar amount for orders from one quarter to another. We have tended to say that orders have been up sequentially or down sequentially, et cetera. And in our second quarter, we had a softer quarter because of what we just discussed around the pushing out of some of those orders. And as you think about it, a first quarter order that pushes out, you’re obviously not shipping it. And it may get done in Q2. So I would say yes we had a softer orders quarter in Q1 than we expected, and that’s it reflected in our Q2 guidance.\nDave Kang: And do you expect similar trends in fiscal second quarter, or you think they’re going to rebound?\nKevin Rhodes: We’re – we right now, I would say our visibility into the second quarter is stronger than it was in the first quarter from a orders perspective. But we’re not done with the quarter yet. And so, I don’t know whether at the end of the year, we’ll have the same phenomenon that we had in September with orders pushing again. So that’s the challenge, if you will we have right now from a visibility perspective, the macroeconomic is, are these sales cycles going to continue to elongate? Are things going to continue to push where you can’t ship it in the quarter? That’s the phenomenon.\nEd Meyercord: Yes, Kevin, I’ll jump in and say that from a revenue perspective the impact on revenue, we feel like we hit bottom in the December quarter with product orders being up – with being up slightly. But again, a lot of those orders now in our environment, will spill into the March quarter orders that they come in at the end of the quarter usually don’t get shipped and wind up shipping in the following quarter. So that – does that answer your question, Dave?\nDave Kang: Yes. Yes. And my follow-up is regarding your competitors, previously you said you don’t typically run into Juniper and Arista. Juniper and Arista seems like their enterprise business has been growing nicely in recent quarters. Are you seeing them more in your end markets?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. We see – we never see Arista. Their enterprise market is very different than our enterprise market. I think that’s an extension of maybe the large financials and some of the other larger, an extension of their cloud data center business with larger customers. But in our market it would be very unusual for us to see Arista. As it relates to Juniper, we see them more frequently. And Juniper is investing in the enterprise market, I think more heavily in the verticals where we play. I think if you read the tea leaves [ph] on what Juniper said, I think they’re calling the same high single digit growth from a demand perspective that we are in the near term. From a revenue perspective, they’re still unloading a lot of backlog.\nDave Kang: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nChristian Schwab: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. So the – is it safe to assume that backlog is probably almost back to a somewhat normalized level since the conversation is returning to kind of pre-COVID conversation, talking about a funnel and a pipeline versus previous conversations of a backlog driving material growth for a material period of time. Is that fair?\nEd Meyercord: Christian, I think it’s fair to say that the – our backlog as it relates to distribution is normalized. But we still have a fair amount of customer backlog that’s out there. And yes, I can give an example of like Kroger, we had a very large win with Kroger. They’re deploying to all their stores. They don’t necessarily want all the equipment upfront at once. They want to time that with their deployment. So we have customer request dates, very specific customer request dates. That is one of – from one example of many. And what we’ve said and what continues to be the case is that we see the normalization of our backlog at the end of fiscal – Q4 of this fiscal year.\nChristian Schwab: That’s right. That’s right. Yes. And just to follow up on that, the push outs that you were talking about at quarter end, is that direct customer push outs or was that unanticipated distribution channel push outs? Those are customer...\nEd Meyercord: Those are customer, yes.\nChristian Schwab: That’s what I thought. Okay. Great. And then my last question, a return to 15% top line growth in 2025 with 30% of your revenue recurring seems like a really strong growth rate for products. So I’m trying to figure out or back into, what you guys’ growth assumptions for industry growth is versus market share gains to attain that growth objective?\nKevin Rhodes: Well, a couple things. I mean, one, we’ll go through the long range model next Tuesday, right at our investor conference. So we can talk a little bit more about 2025 then. Right now we’re not guiding for 2025. I think the biggest point is that recurring revenue will continue to grow. You’re seeing subscriptions grow 30% right now. And so we have to – that’s the gift that keeps on giving over the next several years. We think this is an air pocket, as we mentioned earlier. And so we think that there will be demand coming back towards the end of this year into 2025. So that should normalize and we still have a good – like we talked about pipeline and we have a building pipeline. And so that gives us confidence as well that this is a macroeconomic issue for a period of time and hopefully will abate here within this year. And then 2025 should be a normal, more spending – normalized spending year. At least that’s the visibility we have right now into 2025.\nEd Meyercord: And Christian, I point out, we – a lot of our confidence comes from funnel and we mentioned that we have double-digit funnel growth in terms of the year-over-year opportunities. And so, a lot of the opportunities that are getting pushed out, will come to fruition in addition to new demand. So there’s a combination of our core business where we’re taking share. If Cisco is a market proxy in terms of what they’re calling, it’s kind of low single digit when we take share the function is how much share a point of market share is over 20% growth for Extreme because of our relative size. And that’s in the core business. And I also mentioned, we have invested and we’ve just rolled out and we’re the early stage of ramping a managed services platform. There’s a lot of interest in MSP. We’re seeing a lot more people turn to MSP. We’ve talked about some of our other strategic investments in terms of global security compliance certifications that apply in the U.S. market as well as targeted opportunities abroad. And we have some other interesting opportunities that are really white spaces for us where we haven’t played. So as we look at the components of core market taking share, and then we look at new white space investments where we haven’t played before, and they’re more commercial models, they don’t require heavy investment. But it’s more about relationship and go-to-market. And these are new for us and they’re just at the early stages of ramp. So those growth rates will be much higher than the market. And to Kevin’s point, I would encourage participation next week at our investor conference because we’re going to get into it in a lot of detail.\nChristian Schwab: Okay, great.\nEd Meyercord: And the last point I would make is that subscription line is growing at 30%.\nChristian Schwab: Right. Right. No, I understood that math. I just wanted the market share gain math, which I think you directionally understand what you’re saying. Yes. Great. Thank you.\nEd Meyercord: Thanks, Christian.\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. Thanks, Christian.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Greg Mesniaeff with West Park Capital. Your line is open.\nGreg Mesniaeff: Yes, thank you. Looking at your geographic distribution, can you hear me?\nEd Meyercord: Yes, we can.\nKevin Rhodes: Yes, we gotcha.\nGreg Mesniaeff: Oh, good. Okay, gotcha. Okay, looking at your global geographic distribution, I think EMEA was about 40% last quarter. I didn't see what it was this slide. I haven't had a chance to see it yet. But going forward, given that EMEA has been a soft area for you for understandable reasons, do you foresee just shifting your sales and marketing focus more back home to the domestic market and maybe to Asia Pac markets, to kind of offset, to kind of channel your resources where the opportunities are still strong from a macro standpoint?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. Greg, EMEA is still hovering around 40%. I think it was 41%-ish. We talked about realigning resources and the answer is yes. We're actively managing. Fortunately, because of our size and because of the way we manage the business, we move very quickly. And yes, we're realigning resources to drive our investment behind success where we see the growth markets. Within a very short time when we realized what was going on here with near-term demand, we made some quick decisions as we pointed out. And a lot of those decisions were around go-to-market. And we commented on investment in Asia Pacific. There's a lot of year-over-year growth in Asia Pacific for us will be higher above the mean overall. And we're looking at target investments, for example, in federal where we have significant opportunities and in other pockets. But your point is spot on. Yes, we're looking at realigning resources where we can drive growth in the business. And we also look at the productivity of our resources that are in the field. And if sales are off, then we have to realign those resources to make sure we're driving productivity.\nGreg Mesniaeff: Gotcha. And my follow on is, Ed, you very briefly mentioned what I thought was a very interesting opportunity that you are currently in, I guess, discussions with some carriers about offering a enterprise solution through wireless carriers. Can you give a little more color on that?\nEd Meyercord: Yes. I think we'll talk more in detail next week at our Investor Conference. But the bottom line is that we have some strong relationships with some very large service providers who are just satisfied with current networking relationships. And there's been a kind of, I'd say, mutual outreach. We see some creative ways to work with them, to help them drive the profitability of their business. There's a lot of interest in this. It's still early innings, but the volumes and potential size of the opportunities are quite large. And so, yes, there's an opportunity for us to work with them in a way where they can enhance and drive profitability and kind of reinvigorate some of their enterprise sales by replacing, I'd say, some of maybe the older, larger networking vendors with Extreme. And we've got a customized solution that we're working on and we'll share more details in Investor Day.\nGreg Mesniaeff: Thank you.\nEd Meyercord: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Genovese with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Genovese: Hi. Great, thanks. A lot of my questions have been asked already. Questions about your sort of new go-to-market initiatives and confidence that orders will come back. So I'll just want to kind of summarize those comments for us again? And then my second question, which I'll ask now is just if you could talk about margins. Despite the revenue cut, you're still looking for pretty good EPS growth. So just sort of go through those dynamics of what we should expect from margins a little bit more, please? Thanks.\nKevin Rhodes: Sure. So there's what we're doing, Mike – there's what we're doing in the core business to take share, my comments. Yes, I made a point of commenting on what matters the most in the market overall right now, and networks are inherently complex. And in the enterprise space, people are trying to come to grips with how do we simplify – how do we simplify the environment and how do we make sure that we have flexibility going forward, and we don't have a vendor lock situation where we get kind of stuck in a certain technology. And do we have modern networking tools? And today Extreme is by far the simplest in terms of our solutions, the most flexibility, and we have the most modern tools in terms of modern networking tools. So we become a very attractive alternative. So our share gain profile, and when we're winning the kind of accounts that we're winning with the kind of names that we're winning for references, that bodes very well for us. And our customer names support our brand and support us in building our brand in the marketplace. So that's just core market, market share gains. You'll hear more about that, but we have a ton of these larger opportunities behind us, and it's kind of success begets success. In terms of the new market opportunities, a lot of enterprise customers don't want to be in the networking business. And so they want service provider or managed service providers, which are a lot of people on our channel to provide a managed service. The problem with managed services is that the platforms are really complicated and difficult to manage. And a managed service provider has to have so many interfaces into so many different clouds and into so many different portals, and the billing is complicated, et cetera. So we set out over a year ago to build a managed service platform – a modern managed service platform based on simplicity. And we've come up with what is a very exciting platform that greatly simplifies the ability to provide a managed service from a networking perspective and all the elements that we're providing. And so there's been a huge amount of excitement around it. It does take a while to stand up. We started off with a goal of five service providers. We mentioned now we're at seven. We think that's going to scale up quite a bit. And we're going to make it much easier for a managed service provider to deliver a networking experience, far easier. And then with the simplicity of licensing, et cetera, the whole package will make it easier. So we're optimistic there. It doesn't really affect fiscal 2024 much, but it'll start to play a role in fiscal 2025. We talked about the private subscription offers to some very large service providers to support them in their enterprise business. Very early innings here, we have a couple of large players we're talking to. One specifically, it has a massive backlog and a pipeline of opportunities. So we're excited about that. We're investing in FedSerts [ph]. It's an area that we had under-invested in previously. We have new resources that we've hired that have uncovered some very targeted specific opportunities that we're pursuing that open up much higher than normal industry growth opportunities there. We also mentioned Asia Pacific where we have been rebuilding that team. We have very strong leadership there and we see big opportunities and verticals like hospitality. And we've had a massive – the largest deal ever that we've won in Asia Pacific, $10 million deal in Indonesia. We can build on that success. We're having a lot of success right now in Japan. Korea, where we've been historically strong, we have some really large opportunities with some of the large players there. So those are the areas in terms of managed service with global security and certification, the private offer as well as Asia Pacific investments. The last thing that we're doing is we're about 66% of our networking gear is licensed and runs in cloud. And we have a plan to make that 100%. So we see accelerated growth and subscription as we build out our Extreme cloud, not just a cloud management platform, or a management tool, but an Extreme cloud platform as a service orchestrator. And we'll talk about that on Investor Day as well.\nMike Genovese: Okay, that was a lot of color. Thanks for that. And then just on the margins, talk more about how the bottom line here grows a lot faster than the top?\nKevin Rhodes: Ed, you want me to cover that one?\nEd Meyercord: Go for it.\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. I think Mike, so it's kind of rooted in our planning process, right? When we develop our annual planning process, we look at discretionary spend and what that is, and then our fixed spend. And we understand that the levers we need to pull, if we need to pull back, we can pull back on hiring, we can pull back on discretionary spend and the like, if we see the business environment changing. We were able to act quickly, which was great for us in the quarter, to this kind of evolving market environment. So that's still enabling us to have a good second quarter from an EPS perspective, and obviously helps us for the rest of the year as well. So I would say, we feel confident in our ability to achieve that 25% growth in EPS this year. There's not many companies out there where you can say, hey, even if your top line is single- to high-teens revenue growth, you're still delivering 25% profitability. And we've been delivering high levels of growth and profitability for quite some time, for several years. And so we think that that is an important element for shareholders to look at and realize that this company is going to get through this air pocket, still deliver good, strong, profitable growth this year. And then next year, we'll turn back into a more mid-teens growth company and deliver that margin as well. So that's the goal.\nMike Genovese: Great. Can I just have one quick follow up there? Could you just talk a little bit of sort of gross margin versus operating margin? The comments seemed to me focused more on the operating expenses, but I think there's a gross margin to come as well?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. I mean, we're going to continue to look at ways of how we can continue to expand our gross margin for sure, Mike. I think we originally said that we're expecting it to be somewhere in the 62% range for the full year. We're not backing off that. We think that we will continue to see improvement throughout the year. I don't know if it's going to be 90 basis points sequentially every single quarter, but we are expecting that we continue to improve our gross margins throughout the year. That's going to help.\nEd Meyercord: Yes. And Mike, what's implied in a 62% gross margin is obviously we end the year over that and more of a 63% range. So it relates to growth margins. We continue to see gross margin stepping here as we come out of supply chain and as we see some of the mixed dynamics as it relates to subscription, et cetera.\nKevin Rhodes: Good point, Ed. Yes.\nMike Genovese: Very well, thanks. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Ed Meyercord for closing remarks.\nEd Meyercord: Okay. Well, first of all, I thank everybody for participating in the call. We appreciate your interest in Extreme. I want to shout out. We get a lot of employees and customers and partners that join as well. So I want to thank our employees for all the hard work and customers and partners for the business relationship and the commitment to Extreme. As far as everyone is concerned here, we invite everyone to tune into Investor Day. We have a lot of opportunities and we're going to go into a lot of detail around the core market, the growth opportunities, as well as kind of help what this looks like from a financial perspective. So we invite everyone to participate there and we hope to just see you there. I'll reiterate, we see this as a short-term phenomenon and we remain committed long-term to delivering on double-digit growth in the top line. And obviously what that means with operating leverage to the bottom line. Thanks everybody and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect."
