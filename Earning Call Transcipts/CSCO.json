        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nSami Badri: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal year '24 conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons are made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please feel free to see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better-than-anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases. We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter. Our pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions and generating higher levels of ARR with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook. Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress. However, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are 1 to 2 quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months. Our team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that non-hardware-centric revenue in areas such as security and collaboration increased and our observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable and on a rolling 4-quarter basis, our market share remained steady in three of our four largest markets. Now moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities. With our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner. As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco networking cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our security, collaboration and observability portfolios leveraging AI throughout. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with Nvidia to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads. We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure. In web scale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads. In security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions. This quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI Assistant and Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next 6 months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments. In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst and Meraki platforms. ThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications and things through billions of daily measurements of the Internet and public SaaS, as well as thousands of enterprise customers creating best-in-class digital experiences for users. In observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications and efficient resolution of session level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most, minimizing tool sprawl, improving overall performance and delivering highly secure digital experiences. Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours and AI, security and observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency. We are excited that together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize three key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory and ongoing weakness in Service Provider. Second, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and industry-leading innovation for our customers. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9% and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless and routed optical networking, driven primarily by weakness in the Enterprise and Service Provider & Cloud markets. Security was up 3% with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3%, driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling, partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 16%, driven by growth across the portfolio with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere, on-premise, Internet and the cloud. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. In total short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%. Q2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1 as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8% and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 40%, Enterprise was down 6% and Public Sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7%, up 280 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage. Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce with estimated pretax charges of approximately $800 million. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million, driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax. This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. Given the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value. With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions. And as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it will close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance. Turning to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they received from us and the weakness of our Service Provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes, good afternoon. I'll ask both my questions upfront. Chuck, when I think about the lower revenue guide for the full year by about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago. Can you just touch on how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? And then how do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically? And then as a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this Nvidia announcement you folks had. There's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flush that out, what that means for Cisco? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Amit, thank you very much. So obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talk to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. And what we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. So that's the difference that we've seen. As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of those - the three, including the digestion issue, as well as the telco and SP piece. I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly. However, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be - we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that SP telcos, the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in the '25, they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true. And I think that - so I think the consumption issue and the SP thing or the consumption issue is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see and the SP telco probably similarly. And all of these things led us obviously to reset the second half of the year. On the Nvidia partnership, it is definitely Ethernet. I was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. So - but it will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Amit. Michelle, we have the next analyst.\nOperator: Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe you've mentioned Service Provider, but I guess just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge or if it comes to kind of the five investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago, or any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly? And then just maybe as a second question, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from? Just any commentary would be helpful there. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see observability as you saw the 16% growth rate. We even saw collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They're at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses. We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. And so we see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both observability opportunities, as well as the rearchitecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years. I think the real issue right now is that we shipped so much networking in our core business that that's where the challenge is that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now. As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I would tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the - the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise began to emerge. And there's a heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise. And I think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to extend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. So that's about what I could tell you at this point.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Michelle, can we go to the next analyst.\nOperator: Yes, David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck and maybe for Scott also. If I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal '19 revenue levels. So I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as a sort of investor - as sort of customer digest product. Obviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio, given some of the other parts of the business has grown. So I just wanted to kind of try to get a sense for how you're thinking about the portfolio today, given we're kind of back to fiscal '19. And then from a profitability standpoint, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. But is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today? Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes, David, I'll start and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember, it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. And since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog as we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. And so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on. What we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream. So I don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? And so at this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed. I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? Then we can get back to regular ordering and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go four quarters out to be able to compare it to a more normalized point. So I think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. But there's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company.\nChuck Robbins: And David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the - just look at the last published reports that came out after Q...\nScott Herren: Q3, calendar...\nChuck Robbins: Calendar Q3, the - in our four largest markets, so if you take campus switching, you take wireless and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. So I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. But to be - we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their web scale sales into data center switching, and we report our web scale sales into SP routing. So those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. But the others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling four quarter even over the last 3 years.\nSami Badri: Thank you, David. Michelle, next analyst.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one and ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. So the orders this quarter down 12%, not too bad. And I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again, given the comparison and the trend. The other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the web-scale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers? Or will they mix and match, how do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity? And I really mean this more longer term, '25, '26, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share. Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Simon. So on the order trajectory, I think what - we clearly don't guide bookings. But what I would tell you is that even as our teams modified their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. So your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that. On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of web scale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology and our GPUs. And so I think it's important to remember, they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want two sources, and so we're both actually - the two of us are actually playing in this space today. And I'd say today, they're completely homogeneous clusters. And I think it's too early to tell whether there will be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is, unless there's something that changes significantly or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point. I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Simon. Michele, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hi. I have two questions. The first one is security. The market is great. And we met 2 years ago and 3 years ago when you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there? And what can you do to fix security and benefit from this market growth? And then maybe I'll ask my follow-up.\nChuck Robbins: Okay. Thanks, Tal. So I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year, we would start to see an acceleration of security. And I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that - some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR and Secure Access, Multicloud Defense suites are - we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies. XDR, we now have - we announced that in April last year, we shipped in August. And we have 230 customers, 230-plus customers on the platform today. And the important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. And we actually typically see that as a 6 to 9-month sales cycle. So to have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing. That's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. So that we see, we see - we feel good about the pipeline. From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the Americas, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. So I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. And if you just watch over the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. And I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Tal. And we'll get to your other question at some point after the call. Michelle, can we move to the next speaker.\nOperator: Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, I'm going to - for my first question, I ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time, sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. But I guess what I'm hearing from you today is even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal '24, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand? And are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal '25, if you can share what you're seeing from customers there. And for my follow-up, the Nvidia partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order [ph] target of $1 billion ? Or is it really most of that partnership that realizes beyond that sort of target window, target time frame? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks. I would say on the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicated - we asked them point blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter, and we heard more, a little bit more. And then we saw the push out of the forecast. So that just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. So therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal '25. On the Nvidia discussion, a couple of comments. We talked about the $1 billion of orders, which I know someone is going to ask me about at some point. And what I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continue to grow. The pipeline is now almost three times that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in '25. The total pipeline is now about three times that, roughly three times that. And I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the Nvidia partnership yet. It's all independent of that.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks for the question, guys. Hey, Chuck. Hey, Scott. I wanted to ask about the HP, Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term? And how do you think that helps you long term? And if you - Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, your - one of your competitors, obviously, is expecting quite a big pickup next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year? Or what's your timing on that? Thanks so much.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Ben. So I would say on the HP, Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless. And I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in $1 million-plus wireless deal sequentially. So it's hard to say. But I mean there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. So I think we're - I think it's a little early for them to - for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us. On the timing, yes, I think we said fiscal '25, which starts in August of this year. And I think you probably should assume most of that is probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in the early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities.\nScott Herren: Yeah. But, Ben, our expectation is the majority of that $1 billion in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal '25, just to be clear.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Ben. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, thanks so much. And I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. So main question, just around inventory digestion. Is that dynamic primarily affecting enterprise and commercial customers? And can you talk a little bit about the visibility you've got towards this actually resolving itself by fiscal year-end? And then a follow-up just on gross margins. You were fairly stable sequentially, and I think the guide implies more of the same. So I'm just wondering, are we now largely past a lot of the supply chain dynamics or headwinds? Or has anything changed on the supply chain front? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. So I'll take the first, and then Scott can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's - I would say it's largely an Enterprise and a Service Provider issue and particularly the cloud providers, we think they've got probably in excess of 20-plus weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up when the lead times were so long. We have a lot of our Enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud for management perspectives. And so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connected. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks. And so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio, how the time frame between shipments and connectivity is shrinking, and it's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of '24, so that's where we are. Scott, gross margins?\nScott Herren: Yes. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics. But to your question on where does this settle in? I think it settles in the range we're in right now in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly, and we continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there. The scale of the services ramp up as you - obviously, services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those three really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. And since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. So I think when you add all those together, we should settle in, in the 66% to 67% range. And the majority of, if not all of the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question, Chuck and Scott. I just have two. First, just on the revenue guidance, I think based on the midpoint of it, the implied fiscal 4Q revenue guidance only implies about plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. Given that we're back to a normal backlog, what's preventing that from going back to a more normal level of seasonality? And then as a follow-up to Amit's question earlier on the Nvidia AI deal. I just wanted to clarify. I understand that it's Ethernet, but will it be both Nvidia's, Spectrum-X, as well as Cisco's Ethernet? And how will that be sold together, if that's the correct assumption? Thank you.\nScott Herren: Michael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. As Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. And I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point.\nChuck Robbins: On the Nvidia front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go to market, and our global ecosystem and partner community. And therefore, when these solutions are flowing through our channels and our sales teams and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Michael. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I'm just curious about - are there any mechanisms or activities you guys are using to help accelerate the clearance of inventory from the channel? Any price discounting, any rebating stock rotation, how are you taking an active approach here? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: I'll comment - I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. And I know that our sales teams were talking this week, Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help?\nScott Herren: Yes. We absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both - sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were pre-pandemic. So we're not seeing any of that - any pressure on that front.\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence. You may go ahead.\nWoo Jin Ho: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Given that most of the weakness is going to be on the networking side, could you just talk a little bit more about the future software subscription renewal rates. You did a good job this quarter with software subscriptions going up 5%, but given that networking is poised to be down, curious where that's heading going forward.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. I think - thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is, we put a - as you can imagine, when you built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success and driving adoption and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly. When you look at where we're more software-heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we reported growth - revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. So we are seeing that actually trend in the right direction.\nSami Badri: Thank you. Woo Jin. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, one question, one follow-up. So first, maybe, Chuck, can you talk a little bit, excuse me, about the kind of margin growth trade-off with the headcount reduction, obviously, protect the margin here, but how do you think about that trade-off given the challenging growth we've seen? And then just on a follow-up with all of the AI comments, Chuck, could you just remind us kind of where we are with - from a product standpoint, are you seeing more traction for Silicon One or software or the full system products? If you could just give us a little color on kind of where you're seeing that pipeline growing? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Tim. So on the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that. And we're very disciplined, though. And we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see and your technology and what you deliver. And if you look at a lot of our competitors, and you look at some of the market share, I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. And I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. So while we always look at margins versus growth, we also are - we're just disciplined across both. On the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now. We've got the Ethernet running in three of the four big ones, and we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time. We've got GPUs in our UCS platforms. And so it's evolving, but we have - I tell our teams unlike the original cloud transition that we talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world. I think we are absolutely ready and well equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Tim. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'll speak to one, just building on that last question. I know over periods of time, you've talked a little bit about how large your webscale business is. Can you just remind us again the presence you have in some of the webscale opportunities, either from a size and maybe ex the AI discussion, what kind of growth rates you're seeing, particularly with those webscale customers right now?\nChuck Robbins: So our team measures what their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it, there are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the webscale players. And Scott, keep me honest, I want to say we're designed into '16 or...\nA -: 21.\nChuck Robbins: 21 of those. And so that's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they wouldn't be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. So they're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. So I don't think that's - it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases. And as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. In the traditional days with carriers, they wanted two vendors who would provide two different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon, they look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality.\nScott Herren: Aaron, the only thing I'd add is - and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a complete box, a white box and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is a tailwind for us longer term.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Aaron. And Michelle, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Scott, based on a couple of comments you made around gross margins. Just wondering, with supply chain starting to go the other way and supply more readily available, could we see the price increases enacted in the past now have to be given back? And any sense to how should we think about the annualized cost savings on these reductions, understanding there are people here and difficulty and what areas you guys expect to kind of reduce down and if some of those reductions are filled elsewhere in terms of like a net basis on headcount? Thanks, guys.\nScott Herren: Yes. On the price declines, you got to remember, go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. And that was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints and supply demand is pretty straightforward. What we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down, memory is a good example. But we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. And so with that - and you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. So I'm not anticipating at this point, price declines pending significant cost declines coming into us. On the cost savings, you can see where we are year-to-date. We've got - if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year-to-date, operating expenses are modestly up. And after working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Jim. Cisco's next quarterly conference call, which will affect our fiscal year '24 third quarter results will be on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nSami Badri: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter fiscal year '24 quarterly conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's new Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Having followed Cisco on the sell-side for 10 years, I couldn't be more excited to join the company and look forward to engaging with you all in my new role. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As a reminder, we have simplified how we report product and service revenue and customer markets. Starting this quarter, we are reporting revenue in the following five categories: networking, security, collaboration, observability, and services. And we are reporting customer markets in the following three categories: enterprise, public sector, and service provider and cloud. Also, as is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on forms 10-K which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024, with the strongest first quarter results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and record non-GAAP operating margin. We also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders. As we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now turning to the demand environment, after three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Our order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders. We saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders in customers' hands, still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence. We expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable, cancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns to our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher growth areas, in the first quarter of fiscal '24, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability. The combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership and outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance. As I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which was broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security and full stack observability. As expected, we continued to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. In webscale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale ethernet AI fabric. We also already have line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year '25. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions including ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures with a commitment to open networking for AI. Collectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations and compute GPU networking software and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with a proven power saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One put us in a strong position to build-out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to Security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform. Since our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack. With our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful positive results in the coming quarters. In our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game changing AI capabilities, spanning the entire Webex suite as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries. While we were not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future, with the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security and observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach, regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%; and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and datacenter were both up double-digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless. Security was up 4%, driven by our Zero Trust and threat intelligence, detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in Calling and Contact Center, partially offset by a decline in Meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue based offerings. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase with software subscription revenue also up 13%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14% and service RPO increased 11%. In total, short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment, year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20% with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13% and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 38%, Enterprise was down 26%, and Public Sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points. The increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements, with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. Favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40% primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter highlighted by topline growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger than anticipated earnings per share. We continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on disciplined expense management without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities. Turning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels. As Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes, one quarter to two quarters of lower revenue and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to $55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.93. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami, so we can move into the Q&A.\nSami Badri: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue-up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\nSami Badri: Tal, you there?\nTal Liani: Yes. Sorry. I was on mute. Now you can hear me. What is your assumption on the growth seasonality after the next quarter? Are we back in your assumptions to normal seasonality? Or do you expect kind of different seasonality than previous years?\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, it's a great question. As I said in -- well, we talked about one quarter to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers, it's not yet been installed. I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and in Q3. But when you look at the order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second-half of the year, both sequentially and year-on year as we get there.\nTal Liani: So in terms of revenue recognition, you expect 3Q to -- the 2Q to 3Q sequentials, that's -- that was my question. Do you expect 3Q to be weaker than previous seasonality? Or do you expect it to be the same as previous seasonality? Or even sequentially?\nChuck Robbins: No, from a revenue standpoint, we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see sequential increase, Q2 to Q3.\nTal Liani: Okay. Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Tal.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Tal.\nSami Badri: Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a question on, if you see the investment categories kind of changing maybe free, the orders that you've seen, and then when do you see them come back in a couple of quarters. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of have much of the orders we've seen over the last year been catch-up investments like campus and data center? And then areas of investment will change as we come back or is this really just inventory digestion and the investment categories and kind of investment prioritization will stay the same with customers? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference. Although, I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio and security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. But in general, I think it will look more normal once we get through this.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, one of the things I think folks will struggle to understand is the conviction you have that this is an implementation pause and not a macro demand-centric weakness. So I'd love to just understand whatever you can talk about it and why you're so convinced this is a one-quarter to two-quarter implementation rather than enterprise demand is just getting weaker. Anything on that front would be helpful? And then, I just want to clarify the spot. You folks had $1 billion in AI orders that's two times the number you gave last time is that correct? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Amit, thank you. So if you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this -- this is a -- an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90-days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our large -- and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way. The other thing is, we had our Partner Summit last week and some of our largest partners unsolicited began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which candidly I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear. It's so consistently at that Partner Summit. So, that's sort of the subjective view and then we've done some analysis and there's three things I'd point out. The first is, in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can -- we can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud like Meraki/And what we've seen is a one-quarter to two-quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. So that's the first piece. The second is, we had a very strong quarter in federal, U.S. federal, from an orders perspective. And so, we looked into why big customer like the U.S. government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue. And the reality is, is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions, and certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. So they never had a big influx, they had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our Transactional Advanced Services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20% and the forecast for Q2 is almost double-digits again. So it's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. And I'll give you one final subjective data point and then I'll talk about the AI stuff. We had one big partner tell us that they will have literally hired 200 people in the last 90-days, solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. So there is just so many things that we've learned over the last 90-days. Clearly, this surprised us. But I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro, candidly it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. But as we've discussed prior, we have -- the traditional service provider has been tough and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle, they remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal, that's remained. But we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. And so all of that -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough, all of that is really what led us to believe this -- that this is a consumption issue with our customers. So I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to-date. We have taken orders for over $500 million. For infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. Then -- and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. The numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers. Let's say, in fiscal year ‘25, which is when we said, we believe that the broad ethernet build-out would occur underneath GPUs. We have already seen -- we have line of sight to $1 billion plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already. So that's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal ‘25, okay. I will also just cover real quickly, we are now -- we now have our ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four Hyperscalers, major Hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to create solutions including ethernet technology's GPU-enabled infrastructure joint -- jointly tested and validated reference architectures. And I will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four of his -- four, five of his executives came over to see us and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. And we believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise. So we're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve. And we think that partnership with NVIDIA, in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go to market, we think will be a winning combination. So we're working on that as well. So there's a lot going on in the AI space.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Amit. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to unpack the networking segment a little bit in terms of the trends. And really what I'm trying to get at is, understand sort of what's doing better, what's doing worse, and in that I suspect it's datacenter bounced us pretty good whereas maybe campus is a bit weaker and declining. And that hopefully during this transition to the new segmentation, if you could give us a little bit more color within networking? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Hey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously the demand signal is little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field and that we have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. That's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic. And our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door. That's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customers' level. But when you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point, a huge difference between, for example, datacenter or campus networking. But what we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points. That's been slightly slower than what we've seen. It just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Simon.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Simon.\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about your share repurchase cadence. Stock obviously could get hit here. We have been talking about $5 billion in buybacks or so for the year. I know some of that stops that dilution. If you guys are confident in the second half pickup, is there any potential that you would be more aggressive in the upcoming quarter? And how are you thinking about share repo this year, given current dynamics with the Splunk deal coming? Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional costs. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. So the Splunk transaction is not, in any way, having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through the -- through share buybacks. We expect to continue that higher level and consistent higher level of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We also will obviously look at the opportunity -- at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we will obviously take a look at.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Ben.\nBen Reitzes: Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I can just clarify one thing first. I think, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you did say, you saw the more pronounced impact on the orders in the month of October. I think that's what I heard you say. I mean, just curious, are you implying that you did see an improvement in orders in the sort of first couple of weeks of November itself and that's maybe part of your confidence in that? It's a bit more temporary than a longer pause from the customers? And then you did mention large partners really being the ones that are facing this sort of inventory installation problem. What gives you sort of color that SMB, the smaller customers sort of not going to face the similar issue or are you also baking that in, in terms of your sort of next couple of quarters of headwinds that you're thinking about on the revenue side? Thank you.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we didn't expect to see this. And we had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales start-up process that happens in the first say six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. So what we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter. And then into October is when we expect to see, the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together, and it just didn't. And that's what -- that was the comment about that it was primarily -- we really -- it was really clear to us in October that -- that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they’re the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we -- what confidence we have if it's not SMB, if you look at orders, we look at -- we look at a sub-segmentation within enterprise now, and within service provider, etc., and SMB was fine. And in fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. So it just follow the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket and small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Scott, maybe this is for you. I just want to unpack maybe one of the comments that you made. And I know you don't guide to orders. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said backlog is back at normal levels at the end of the quarter. So, we do assume that the guide for Q2 and the rest of the year doesn't include backlog conversion into revenue? And then, if that's the case, to your comment about orders accelerating in the second half, I know you don't guide specifically to orders, but you did make a comment that revenue is going be up, I think, sequentially in the third quarter year-over-year and in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-over-year. Doesn't that suggest like a pretty steep order acceleration, not just an acceleration, but significant positive order trajectory in the fourth quarter and the third quarter? I know, it's easy comps. But just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. Yes, David, we did say that. I do. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and in Q4. And in both -- and again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue as you'd expect. Backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We would now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. So we do see sequential increases. And as you said, as you noted from a bookings standpoint, our order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points. Obviously, the reverse is true on revenue and the second half revenue will have very difficult compare points than last year.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, David. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Maybe just to dovetail one follow-up to the prior question, I have just another one on margins. Just on the prior one, is the expectation for a second-half improvement in a one-quarter to two-quarter digestion, does that vary at all across the three different customer sets you outlined? And then just on the margins, 36.6% on op income margins this quarter, I think the guide implies a 400 basis point to 500 basis point dip. Is that due to just the sheer revenue decline sequentially? Or are there other cost items we should consider on either the gross margin or OI margin line? Thanks.\nScott Herren: Yes. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66% range. I think at this point, it looks like it will be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. So that's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question.\nMatt Niknam: Just around the expectation for second-half improvement in orders one quarter to two quarters worth of installation, is that broad across the three customer sets? Or does it vary across service provider, enterprise and federal?\nScott Herren: Yes, right. I think, we expect -- I certainly would expect service provider to continue to be difficult through the second-half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both telco and cable, which has one set of market dynamics going on. I think that will be -- continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders while they've got also inventory to work their way through. We do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. So, SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it will continue to have probably the greater impact.\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\nOperator: George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nGeorge Notter: Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. Just continuing on, on that last question. If I look around the space, companies have been dealing with excess inventories for really three quarters now. And I guess, I'm just curious why is this now becoming more evident at Cisco versus a few quarters ago? And then also you mentioned that the issue is spreading more to enterprises. We don't typically think about enterprises is inventorying infrastructure. So I guess, the question for you is, has something changed there or is this more distribution channel inventory? Any insight would be great. Thanks.\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because if -- I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean -- and it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. So they -- I think it's just -- and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead and they had been doing it for sure to your point. And all along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players. So we kind of know when they are going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right. These are the big customers who actually -- if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400, 500 switches, as an example. Or they may be doing a branch rollout. And in some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. So it varies, but it could be a -- either one of those or a combination of both.\nScott Herren: And George, just to put some data to that. And you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. But if you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%. And in Q3, it was 17%. So obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out and as Chuck said in the last two or three quarters.\nGeorge Notter: Alright. Thank you.\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. And then Michelle, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, on the AI orders, $1 billion. What's the feedback from the hyperscalers on your improving position with these customers relative to a few years ago? Is it selling in a more disaggregated fashion with Silicon One? Is it a desire for silicon diversification? And then the second question just as a follow-up on the order slowdown. Was that more concentrated in the campus with wireless LAN and wired or data center or both, just within enterprise specifically?\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think that -- look, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. And we're in -- I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web scale players. And I think we added over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. And I think it's -- so I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in. And now the feedback is as long as we're performing, I think they like our products, they like the power savings of Silicon One. It's a massive power -- lower -- massively lower power consumption. I think they do like silicon diversity for sure. And then as you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard broad-based technology like Ethernet that they can actually have multiple sources. And so we think that's what's driving that now. And now it's just about performing and executing and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, do you want to take the second?\nScott Herren: Yes. Michael, I think I touched on this earlier in the -- as the question came up. I think the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. But where we saw a differentiation was less between big data center infrastructure and campus networking and more between networking and wireless. We did see -- because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out. We did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because it's -- our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that, that they're looking to get installed.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Michael, and all right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, a very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability. And we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition. I think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. expired, meaning that we've effectively pass the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that. At our Partner Summit last night -- or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. And I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders with the operating leverage, capital allocation and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. So thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it back over to Sami.\nSami Badri: Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 14, 2024 and at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.\nOperator: And thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1 (800) 834-5839. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial (203) 369-3351. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time."
