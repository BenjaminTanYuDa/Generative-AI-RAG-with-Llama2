I would now like to turn the conference over to Valter Pinto, Managing Director at KCSA Strategic Communications. Please go ahead.\nValter Pinto: Thank you, operator. Good evening and welcome everyone to Upexi fiscal second quarter 2024 financial results conference call. I'm joined today by Allan Marshall, Chief Executive Officer and Andrew Norstrud, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'm going to remind everyone that statements made during today's conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. for a detailed discussion of some of the ongoing risks and uncertainties in the company's business, I'll refer you to the press release issued this evening and filed with the SEC on form 8-K, as well as the company's reports filed periodically with the SEC. the company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless otherwise required by law. In addition, during the course of the call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release issued this evening, unless otherwise noted. I'd now like to turn the call over to Upexi's CEO, Allan Marshall.\nAllan Marshall: Thank you, Valter. Thank you. Welcome to our fiscal second quarter 2024 financial results conference call. during the second half of 2023, we focused on optimizing and streamlining our operations, investing in our higher-margin brand products and generating positive adjusted EBITDA. The enhanced efficiencies across the business channels bolstered our margins and cash flow sequentially with my expectation that this trending will continue in the quarters to come. While revenues for the most recent fiscal second quarter decreased sequentially, the operating measures we took allowed us to increase gross profit margins to 38% as compared to the prior fiscal first quarter of 31.8%. We also generated positive adjusted EBITDA although the revenue quarter-over-quarter was down. the revenue decreased sequentially was predominantly related to the calculated decision to reduce the risk of purchasing excess inventory in our re-commerce business and investing in our higher-margin brand business. The business is navigating challenging market conditions and being carefully managed quarter-over-quarter to achieve higher profitability while an emphasis on the high-margin recurring revenue brand businesses. the re-commerce business will continue to perform. but overall, the enterprise value will be driven by the brand and their overall growth. with capital constraints, we are prioritizing investments in our brand products businesses, which carries a higher margin profile through subscription revenue, opportunity and capturing a higher lifetime value of the consumer. brand product sales during the second quarter increased 16.7% sequentially to $7.7 million, as compared to prior quarter of $6.6 million. branded products sales as a percentage of total revenue this quarter was 35.1% as compared to prior quarter of 24%. This growth and increase as a percentage of sales helped drive gross margins higher sequentially. Last quarter, we discussed the decision to increase our ad spend on VitaMedica and Health and Wellness to acquire and build subscription rates and increase the overall lifetime value of the products and brands with consumers. During the fiscal second quarter and into our current quarter we're in, we have seen promising financial benefits on the strategy. While we have maintained our marketing budget as a percentage of revenue, subscription revenue across health and wellness grew approximately 5% month-over-month. The strategic investment is measured carefully every month and thus far has increased our gross margins and recurring revenue. to drive further growth, we still expect data from the acne study soon. Successful data will help increase sales significantly in a very large sticky and recurring segment of the health and wellness industry. We are making the same investments in our other branded products, including Tytan Tiles and Lucky Tail, particularly as these brands also launch new product offerings to the market. Before I hand the call over to Andy for further details regarding our financials, I'd like to provide an update on the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities. The consolidation of operations is expected to be complete and fully operational by the end of April. The overall impact on cost savings expected to be $450,000 to $550,000 per quarter or a reduction of approximately $2 million annually in G&A expenses. Consolidation will not slow the increase for our growth initiatives as we are investing in and we anticipate this will lead to increased gross margins and overall cash flow in the coming quarters. I'd like to reiterate my confidence in our ability to drive long-term growth, innovation and value creation. We remain committed to further expanding and enhancing our brand businesses and re-commerce segments while capitalizing on new growth opportunities and reaching higher EBITDA and cash flow positive results this year. I will now pass the call over to Upexi's CFO, Andrew Norstrud to discuss our financial results in more detail. Andrew?\nAndrew Norstrud: Thank you, Allan. Revenue for the fiscal second quarter 2024 totaled $21.8 million as compared to $26.7 million for the same period in the previous year and $27.3 million for the fiscal first quarter 2024. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower re-commerce revenue through both Amazon channels and wholesale. brand product sales during the quarter increased 16.7% sequentially to $7.7 million as compared to $6.6 million, led by the health and beauty product categories. management will continue to focus on the development and growth of high gross margin brand product sales. Cost of revenue for the fiscal second quarter 2024 totaled $13.6 million, a decrease as compared to the $16.7 million for the same period in the previous year and $18.6 million for the fiscal first quarter 2024. The cost of revenue decrease was primarily related to the decrease in re-commerce sales discussed above. the gross margin for the fiscal second quarter 2024 and 2023 was approximately 38% during both periods. the gross margin during the quarter increased sequentially to 38%, as compared to 31.8%. Sales and marketing expense for the fiscal second quarter 2024 decreased 18%, compared to the same period in the previous year and was approximately $160,000 lower than the first quarter ended September 30th, 2023 on higher branded product revenue. the decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily related to management's efforts to refine sales strategies to focus on long-term recurring sales growth through subscription revenue and sales channel expansion. Management will continue to manage the sales and marketing budget strategically for direct-to-consumer sales channels, as the company capitalizes on opportunities to take advantage of lower costs to estimate lifetime value of a customer. management believes that this strategy will yield significant returns in the next 12 months. Management anticipates its advertising expense will be reduced over time as a percentage of sales in the following quarters, which will increase overall profitability. General and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter 2024 totaled $2.3 million, a decrease of 9%, as compared to $2.5 million for the same period in the previous year. Management has managed its general and administrative costs and will continue to implement strategies to decrease the percentage of general and administrative costs as compared to total sales. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $29,000, as compared to an adjusted EBITDA of approximately $557,000 for the same period in the previous year and $750,000 for the first quarter 2024. The company had net loss from continued operations for fiscal second quarter 2024 of $2.4 million, as compared to net income of $2.7 million for the same period in the previous year, a net loss of $1.4 million in the first fiscal quarter 2024. As of December 31st, 2023, the company had cash of $1.8 million in total stockholders' equity attributable to Upexi's shareholders of approximately $25.5 million. As of February 14, 2024, there are 20,889,384 shares of common stock outstanding. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Grey Alliance Global Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nAaron Grey: Hi. good evening and thank you for the questions here. So, first question from me, I just want to talk a little bit about the re-commerce business, right. So, you pointed to the softness in the quarter, certain wholesale transactions not being completed. Was it more a matter of pricing? Was it some last-minute changes? Because I certainly can understand and appreciate the focus on margin, but looks like inventory did build again in the quarter, so was the pricing just to where it was, it would be even like potentially solo of a margin. It wasn't appealing to you even if it might have had some cash conversion or just any color you might have in terms of the re-commerce business during the quarter and then also the inventory. Thanks.\nAllan Marshall: Hey, Aaron. I think the -- some of its timing when it comes in and when it goes out. Some of it was what we talked about at the end of the last quarter, just kind of making sure, one of the concerns was that whole overall gross margin dropping. So -- and we talked about this during the years, we can buy any amount of inventory that's available, but are they meeting our margin profile. So, I think that this quarter, we just didn't see the opportunities that would have met the margin we were looking for. And also, the capital constraints still kind of lead to just us pushing for higher margin on those deals and the reinvestment in the brands is really where it's going to drive overall growth. I mean, we've talked about this over and over, we need that brand revenue with that 80% plus margin to be a bigger percentage of our business. So, the reinvestments there really were to precedent into that. but there's no issues with the business could -- we could do a quarter with $20 million, $30 million in re-commerce revenue is just not what we chose to do at this point in time. So, inventory did bill, we did -- we are always buying stuff. It just -- sometimes it doesn't get sold by the end of the quarter or shipped out and that may or may not come, be sold in this quarter and make a difference as well.\nAaron Grey: Okay. The same question again on the re-commerce. So kind of overall, are you seeing, is it that the margin hurdle is higher for you guys now or are you -- just margin hurdle is the same and you're just seeing less opportunities out there and that's -- I know we've always talked about the shift to brand, right? But you always had kind of the re-commerce business there potentially finding synergies within even with the brands. But I think about the re-commerce business today and that gross margin hurdle you spoke to, is it that the hurdle's been raised or the hurdle's the same and it's harder to find those opportunities out there. because I know it can really come and go depending on what's out there from the manufacturers and otherwise, they're buying products from? thanks.\nAllan Marshall: I mean we've seen good opportunities on much, even large deals we just have really decided to focus more on this brand business today. The margins available maybe not as -- maybe not as much as it had been throughout the prior year. but I expect that after the holidays here we would have seen that opportunity again. The margins usually increase again, when everyone gets stuck with that overstocked inventory. But we're seeing plenty of deals, just trying to manage the business and not lose focus on the overall value of investing in the higher brand, the higher gross margin business, like a gross margin increase this quarter, was just the start of what we think trends over the next couple quarters.\nAaron Grey: Okay, great. Thanks. And yes, shifting over to brands then. So that was up 16.7%. You said that it was led by health and beauty, I believe, I think Andrew said that. So, was Tytan Tiles also within that and was that also a bigger drive? Was it more the health and beauty side? And then as you think about growth going forward, how do you think about split between e-commerce and brick and mortar? Because obviously, brick and mortar's going to have some of that lower margin than some of the e-commerce. but I know you've had some initiatives with Tytan Tiles in terms of getting increased exposure in the brick-and-mortar space. Thanks.\nAllan Marshall: Yes. we're going to go -- we're going to continue, we're going to go better from all aspects, right like Tytan is born out of -- first starting, in DTC or -- and then really evolved into brick and mortar. and now, we're looking to bring those Disney products back to DTC. The margin there is great, the opportunity's great. but our other brands have higher margins and our strictly at this point direct-to-consumer with great opportunity. We've seen, I'm not sure, I guess significant reinvestment and growth just in the first quarter. I think, VitaMedica's, Amazon's up 30%-40%, since we made those started to reinvest just at the beginning of the quarter. So, I think we're just going to continue on all channels blending that margin, but still the bulk of our business is going to be direct-to-consumer with the much higher margins.\nAaron Grey: Okay. All right. great. Thank you very much, and I'll go ahead and jump back in the queue.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nAllan Marshall: All right. well, I want to thank everyone for joining the call and just summarize. The company's in a very good position to increase the overall profitability due to several reasons, our consolidation of operations, the reduction of $2 million G&A. This will reduce our overall cost structure and not slow the growth of the brands or the growth of the profitability. Brand revenue should continue to be a bigger percentage of overall sales. The higher gross margin businesses will post -- will push our gross margins even higher this year. And regardless of market conditions or external factors, myself and our team intend to reach those higher EBITDA and cash flow positive results in the next second several quarters. So, I want to thank everyone for joining our call and I hope everyone has a great evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does include today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Upexi's CEO, Allan Marshall.\nAllan Marshall: Thank you, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 first quarter financial results conference call. As we have navigated through our dynamic economic landscape in 2023, it is crucial to recognize a robust undercurrents that position our company for a promising future. There are things we can control and those we cannot, our share price, which is a largest shareholder, I share frustration with. It's a phenomenon not within our control given the broader markets and events. What we can control is our operational core, which has never been stronger. We have successfully enhanced efficiencies across several business channels, which is a testament to our team's relentless pursuit of operational excellence and innovation. The ongoing streamlining of operations is projected to significantly bolster our margins, reflecting a healthier balance sheet in upcoming quarters. Moreover, growth in key sectors has been a bright spot, demonstrating the efficacy of our strategic pivot and the resonance of our offerings in high potential markets. Our revenue for fiscal Q1 of 2024 grew 140% year-over-year and 53.5% sequentially. During the quarter, we invested significantly in our brands, which impacted our EBITDA margins in the short term. However, this is an investment in the future sales growth and EBITDA, not in our view a negative. Our children's educational toy brand, Tytan Tiles, is a great example of this return on investment. During the quarter, we invested significantly around the Disney Frozen launch and new product launches. Just 1 month into the launch of this product on Amazon, we have a run rate of over 115 units per day, and we have moved our rank on Amazon from 20,000 to 4,000. On Friday, Tytan Tiles had its largest day since launch, reaching #3 in toy magnetic building sets. This is an incredible accomplishment in less than a month for any product launch on Amazon and very promising for the future Disney launches. Our pet products brand, LuckyTail had launched its pet shoes on Amazon and direct-to-consumer. This category is not only a value add to our current mail grinder, but to choose or an item we can push on a subscription basis, building our recurring revenue model for the brand. We spent approximately $250,000 of advertising on this launch and other product launch initiatives. Obviously, this did not convert to immediate revenue, but is necessary to build a more diverse product line, focused on subscription and recurring revenue opportunities for the future. On VitaMedica, earlier this year, we increased our ad spend to acquire and build VitaMedica subscription rates, subsequently decreasing the spend to try to increase profits, which we did in the short term. However, we realize that by doing so, we actually hurt our longer-term subscription growth and profits. We've concluded our larger upfront ad spend, will lead to overall higher lifetime values of the products and brands. And as a result, we started to implement this strategy in fiscal Q1. We expect growth to further accelerate for VitaMedica as we launch complementary products like acting treatments. We expect data from the acne study of this product sometime in January, have invested $25 million on this study and successful data will help to increase sales significantly in a very large, sticky and recurring segment of the health and wellness industry. The overall growth of our brands will be critical to increasing overall margins as we launch more subscription-based product lines, we anticipate this model will drive higher margin and profitability. Re-commerce revenue for fiscal Q1 was 76% of total revenue, an increase of 187% year-over-year. Cygnet Online, our high-volume e-commerce provider of branded OTC products increased revenue sequentially by approximately $1.5 million, with gross profit margin increasing from 44% to 48%. This was accomplished by purchasing products and higher volume, and higher volumes at lower prices and implementing certain price controls. The business positive trend is expected to continue with increased contribution to profit margins in the coming quarter. During the quarter and into the current quarter, we consolidated Cygnet's warehouse into our 3PL warehousing resulting in approximately $0.5 million of reduction in operating expense and increased efficiencies for the future. The business' positive trend should continue with increased contribution margin in the coming quarters. NETi, our re-commerce provider of overstocked and discontinued merchandise for hundreds of retailers increased revenue sequentially during the quarter by approximately $6.3 million. Gross -- average gross profit, however, declined from 17% to 10%. This is primarily related to liquidation of excess inventory and inventory management. Given a slow -- slowing trend in consumer purchasing, we made the strategic decision to sell off excess inventories heading into an uncertain economic environment. Importantly, I wanted to highlight the cost-cutting measures we have implemented over the previous quarters that are now beginning to be reflected in our financial performance. For fiscal Q1, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 8.2% as compared to 19% for the same period in the prior year. Additionally, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue also decreased 29% as compared to 56.5% for the same period in the prior year. We remain committed to our previously announced guidance of generating $100 million in revenue for calendar 2023, and more importantly, to completing our cost cutting and increasing overall profitability. Lastly, before I turn the call over to Andy for details regarding our financials, I would like to take a moment to comment on our balance sheet and seller note due on October 31. We have restructured this note and other debt, paying down a portion and extending the remainder. None of this debt will have a material impact on the future of our business. Our company stands at a pivotal inflection point for growth, underscored by a clear vision and dead fast commitment to our core values. These strategic advances are not miracle incidents, but the result of deliberate, plan to future, proof our business as stewards of this organization, we have collectively laid down a solid groundwork for sustained profitability and innovation. The trust placed in us by our shareholders and customers fuels our drive to excel, and I am confident that the initiatives we have set in motion will materialize into tangible success. Together, we're navigating towards a horizon [indiscernible] opportunity, and I'm confident we will prove out the value of this model over the coming quarters to our stakeholders. I will now pass this call over to Upexi's CFO, Andrew Norstrud, to discuss our financial results in more detail. Andrew?\nAndrew Norstrud: Thank you, Allan. Revenue increased by approximately $16 million or 144% compared to the prior year. The company had strong growth in its branded products segment and its re-commerce segment with the acquisition of NETi. Cost of revenue increased by approximately $13.2 million or 245%, compared to the same period last year. The cost of revenue increase is primarily related to the acquisition of NETi, the re-commerce business. Gross profit increased by approximately $2.9 million compared to the prior year, with approximately $2.1 million of the gross profit growth being directly related to the branded products revenue growth. Sales and marketing expense increased by $1.1 million or 65%, compared to the same period last year. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily related to the focus on the brand segment revenue growth and strategic marketing to maximize the return on long-term recurring customer growth. Distribution costs increased by approximately $700,000 or 34% compared to the same period last year. The increase in distribution cost was primarily related to the overall growth of revenue. However, management has implemented several consolidation, repackaging and pricing strategies to continue to reduce the overall distribution costs of all our product sales. Management expects the implementation of these initial strategies to be completed by March of 2024. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $100,000 or 6%, compared to the same period last year. Management continues to operate the company efficiently to enable sales growth without significantly increasing general and administrative expenses. Management continues to manage its working capital through the use of its operating cash flow and its line of credit. Subsequent to September 30, the company made a $2 million payment on the acquisition notes payable and made arrangements to pay the remaining amount due over a 12-month period, part of the terms of the agreement. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for any questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners.\nAaron Grey: Thank you very much for the questions here. So first question for me. Nice to see the growth sequentially in the sales coming slightly above the guidance. But in terms of the gross margin, a couple of puts and takes there. So I certainly can understand in terms of the NETi, some one-offs in terms of some lower margins there. But you also seem to imply on the brand side, maybe a decision to turn back focus a little bit more towards growth, right? You made some comments on VitaMedica and some other branded investments as well versus some near-term profitability. So maybe you could just give like a holistic view in terms of how you're looking at growth versus profitability now, both in terms of the distribution side on the NETi, Cygnet businesses and also then on the brand side in terms of like investing for growth versus trying to achieve the near-term profitability?\nAllan Marshall: Thanks, Aaron. It's Allan Marshall. I'll go over the kind of little decision on like VitaMedica, for instance, if we look back over the quarters, the brand had some significant jumps quarter, I don't know if we broke it out before, but in like the January, just like November through February, it was trending a little bit higher -- lower on revenue and we invested kind of a lot of money into the upfront costs. So for instance, if we know the lifetime value is $420, we're investing up to $150 or $200. And then subsequent to that, sometime in March, we dropped that down, whatever the percentage was, so it's $120, which was great, because March, April and May for the business were some of the most profitable as far as like net profitable for us as a company. But in June, we saw that subscription revenue start to fall off. So those clients we had brought in, it was -- we were losing more than we were gaining. So what we did during the quarter was we just started to increase and try to slowly increase those budgets, trying to put more people in the top of the funnel, because at the end of the day, the VitaMedica brand, we wanted to be a $10 million brand, a $15 million brand. So we really invest it. Maybe we're investing $170 instead of $120 over this quarter. But over the next couple of months, we'll start to build that funnel and have more people in our overall sales channel. So -- and it was the same with Tytan Tiles as you're developing a new project, you're putting a lot of money to work, have a lot of teams, lot of -- just everything, even launching on Amazon, we're running at a loss for the first several days, and then that starts to clean itself up. And into the weekend, where we saw significant growth on both the number of units being sold and on the decrease in cost of revenue. I mean Amazon is a pretty weird animal, because you're losing money sometimes on all the sales for the first weeks or 2 or months. But then as your branded revenue starts to come back around, you're picking up more and more nonpaid recognition. So you'll float higher up on the pages. So that's really what we're working on and over time and over several months, it's really starting to pay off. We were lucky enough with the Disney launch, it turned really quickly here, at least coming into Black Friday. So pretty hopeful each of those initiatives, I could go through the same thing. But that's the main thinking on it, like we need to invest a little bit upfront to build the funnel, get that recurring revenue going on each of those brands, so that every month, we're starting with a good base and then continue to fill the top side of that funnel as long as it makes overall financial sense over the lifetime of each customer.\nAaron Grey: I appreciate that detail there. So then -- and looking at that, right? So you previously had some implied guidance in your presentation deck in terms of profitability? I know you reiterated your calendar sales guide today of $100 million. So is it fair to say now that it's going to be more-so of that -- more so investment in some of those brands and maybe in the near term, it might not have as much as the EBITDA margins that you had previously been anticipating then in the near term?\nAllan Marshall: I mean I don't think -- I think this one is a little bit different because we did it all. With launches of new products, it drew down extra. And then truthfully even on our [indiscernible] NETi business, we were $300,000, $400,000 short on that. And maybe we could have taken a risk. I don't think -- this is not a standard margin where we're at now. I definitely think it's going to continue to increase. And I don't know if we'll get to -- I don't think we can get up to the top end of that range until we build the funnel a little bigger. But I can say if each of the brands grows back to where we wanted to get to that 20%, 30% over the next quarter or two, we can definitely get way closer to the top end of that range. On top of that, we're really cutting significant amount of expenses. Like I know we've been working on all year. It's just taking -- it takes a long time to close warehouses, negotiate all the stuff out, like, consolidating into Tampa here was a big -- it's going to be a really strategic move for us. And as we close, and I don't want to kind of lay out each thing we're closing, I don't want to employ whatever employees and everything to worry because we're going to do it strategically. But as we consolidate the other side of the business, the other warehouses into either small or strategic ones in those locations or into a single location, we've still got another $1.5 million to $2 million. So I think combined with that, we definitely -- I definitely believe the margins coming back -- are going to come up to that range we want to be in that [5% to 8% range]. Not sure how quickly we get to the top end of that range, but I'm pretty confident we'll get to the bottom end of that range pretty quickly.\nAaron Grey: Okay. Great to hear you plan to return to that margin expansion there. In terms of some of the top line initiatives, right? So the Disney one looks off to a good start looking at some of the Frozen reviews online and implied product sales that you mentioned are also plant online. You talked about some other product lines being launched. Can you speak to the timing of those additional product launches coming and how -- when you might expect them?\nAllan Marshall: No. In 2024, I mean, these are -- take a long time -- yes, I mean it's a long process to go through. Like it was actually -- like I never thought we could make it for nevermind, Christmas -- nevermind Thanksgiving, to have it done, from design to approvals to manufacture in store in such a short time is pretty amazing. So the Tytan team, really everyone, surpassing the expectations there. We are a design and development of a lot of other ones, but there's not a huge issue, because if you think about like even the large retailers as we try to expand the channel on those products in the big box, if it's possible, they're placing orders now for second half, third quarter next year or so. I mean ideally, we would be able to launch a couple here in the first half of the year. That's the goal. I think it's doable, but I don't have an exact time on each one yet. We really wanted to see how this launch did and how much pull the partnership with Disney had and it was better than expected.\nAaron Grey: Okay. Great. And yes, it looks like it's off to a good start there. I want to ask a holistic balance sheet question here, right? So you had the cash balance of $417,000 as of 9/30. You mentioned you changed up turns on the debt that was due in October. I think you paid down $2 million and you'll pay down the remainder in the next 12 months. You have a $6 million credit facility available, and it also sounds like you're building up some inventory for these launches that you're going to have for Frozen, Tytan Tiles and potentially the other ones in 2024. So can you just provide us with your comfort with the credit facility to meet the needs -- working capital needs and otherwise just balance sheet position?\nAllan Marshall: We're comfortable with all of it at this point. We'll work through any problems that come up. We have resources. Also, we're -- with new interest rates in previous quarters at 0%, 1%, 2%, we are more comfortable leaving the cash in the bank and not paying down the line, with interest rates now on the line somewhere over 8%, like we move cash and we get it in to pay down that line as quickly as possible. So every day of interest, we don't have to pay as another day. So you may see that line go to 0 and cash go to 0, and then you may see cash go up to $2 million or $3 million, and then we pay it back down. So we're really going to try to minimize that. But as far as the overall debt of the company, I've said this all along, I feel very comfortable. Our sellers, they're seller notes. There is no -- if people take a good look at the note, they'll see that there is -- if for some reason we need to extend it, it's already in there, the interest rate does go up, but there's no material, which is no crazy default or anything that's going to happen. So I feel comfortable the company is going to be able to work its way through this, and even at some point, restructure into a little longer-term debt that gives us more time to pay it and leave more cash available to grow the business. And that without having to raise equity for sure.\nAaron Grey: Okay. Great. Last question for me just update on Bloomios assets. Any updates on the operations there, plans to be able to consolidate it? Or anything you can provide on that?\nAllan Marshall: It's business as usual for us there. We are going to continue to use it to produce our products at lower cost when available. And we're definitely evaluating what to do with that business. It's not a drag on us. It's a positive. So not material to us, really, but definitely not going to be anything that drag us down. If anything, it will just contribute more to us in the future.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we are showing no more questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Allan Marshall for any closing remarks.\nAllan Marshall: I want to thank everybody for joining the call again. I'll talk to -- just really say thank you to all our shareholders, our team, our investors. We feel like the company is in a great spot for the future. Obviously, we all wish it would be on the market side, be in a better position, but the company from here put up a clean number here this quarter, no sale of assets. So I think as we put the next couple behind us and we continue to grow the business, we feel really confident this thing will pay us the way, continue to grow and hopefully pay for everybody's patience on that, and I appreciate everybody sticking with us and look forward to our next conference call. Everybody have a great holiday, Thanksgiving week, and I appreciate everybody's time again. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
