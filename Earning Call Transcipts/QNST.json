Following prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Investor Relations and Finance, Robert Amparo. Mr. Amparo, you may begin.\nRobert Amparo: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining us as we report QuinStreet's fiscal second quarter 2024 financial results. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Valenti; and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Wong. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the following discussion will contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that may cause results to differ from our forward-looking statements are discussed in our recent SEC filings, including our most recent 8-K filing made today and our most recent 10-Q filing. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.quinstreet.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Doug Valenti. Please go ahead, sir.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you, Rob and thank you all for joining us. December was a successful quarter. We met or exceeded our objectives in the quarter and continued recent positive themes, including growing non-insurance businesses at strong rates year-over-year, investing in and making good progress on growth initiatives across the business, and positioning ourselves well for the re-ramp of auto insurance client spending. All that while delivering solidly positive adjusted EBITDA and maintaining our strong balance sheet. I am particularly proud of those accomplishments, given that we were facing the bottom of the insurance cycle, and our toughest seasonal quarter. The significant positive inflection in auto insurance client spending that we expected to begin in January has indeed begun. Auto insurance revenue is expected to be up well over 100% sequentially this quarter versus the December quarter. Auto insurance client spending increases are broad-based and consumer shopping traffic online for auto insurance is also up as consumers react to the compound rate increases of the past few years. Auto insurance clients have indicated that the steep ramp of spending is likely to continue. Accordingly, we expect strong sequential total company revenue growth and rapid EBITDA expansion in the current March quarter and further strong sequential total company revenue growth and rapid EBITDA expansion again in the June quarter. The exact slope of the auto insurance ramp is impossible to predict, but the ramp is, of course, highly impactful to our results. Turning to our outlook for the current or March quarter, our fiscal Q3. We expect revenue to be between $160 million and $170 million, representing sequential growth of 35% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA to jump to between $7 million and $9 million as we captured the initial immediate impact of operating leverage from the revenue ramp. For fiscal year 2024, which ends in June, we continue to expect company revenue to grow between 5% and 15% over fiscal 2023. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, which begins soon in July, while detailed planning is not yet completed, I am already confident that we will expect strong double-digit full year revenue growth over fiscal 2024. Now, before I turn the call over to Greg for more details on our financial results, let me give you my overall view of where we are. We have limited a fierce macroeconomic storm in auto insurance, our biggest vertical. We have maintained positive adjusted EBITDA and a strong balance sheet throughout, thanks to strong capabilities, disciplined execution, and a resilient business model. Our business model and strong financial foundation allowed us to continue to invest in the future during this period despite the conditions in auto insurance. We rapidly scaled two nine-figure non-insurance client verticals and invested aggressively in our capabilities, products, and footprint for future growth. We are now incredibly well-positioned for the near and long-term. Our footprint for growth is large and diversified, representing tens of billions of dollars of addressable markets. We have big growth opportunities in the expansion of our existing client verticals and in exciting new contiguous markets and product areas. Our capabilities and competitive advantages are clear and strong, and we are improving them and expanding our market opportunities at a rate unprecedented in company history or I would argue, in the history of our industry. I have never been more confident or bullish about our prospects from here, especially, of course, as auto insurance continues to adapt, normalize, and re-ramp. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\nGreg Wong: Thank you, Doug. Hello and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Fiscal Q2 was another solid quarter for QuinStreet. Total revenue was $122.7 million. Adjusted net loss was $2.3 million or $0.04 per share, and adjusted EBITDA was $417,000. Within the quarter, we saw the auto insurance cycle bottom out in November. That being said, we are excited about the significant inflection of auto insurance client spending, which indeed began in January. Looking at revenue by client vertical. Our Financial Services client vertical represented 58% of Q2 revenue and was $71.3 million. Our Home Services client vertical represented 40% of Q2 revenue and grew 15% year-over-year to $49.3 million. Other revenue was the remaining $2 million of Q2 revenue. Turning to the balance sheet, we closed the quarter with $45.5 million of cash and equivalents and no bank debt. Moving to our outlook, for fiscal Q3, our March quarter, we expect revenue to be between $160 million and $170 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $7 million and $9 million. For full fiscal year 2024, which ends in June, we continue to expect revenue to grow between 5% and 15% over fiscal 2023. In summary, let me reiterate Doug's earlier points. One, over the past few years, we have navigated a generational downturn in our largest vertical and continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives, all while generating positive adjusted EBITDA and maintaining our strong balance sheet throughout that period. Two, we are well-positioned to benefit from the significant positive inflection in auto insurance client spending, which has indeed begun in January. And three, we expect strong sequential revenue growth and rapid adjusted EBITDA expansion in the March quarter and again in the June quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Campbell of Stephens Inc. Your line is already open.\nJohn Campbell: Hey guys. Good afternoon. Congrats on the solid quarter.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you, John.\nJohn Campbell: On the -- so on the guidance, I mean, it's certainly encouraging that it feels like it's the kind of early stages of the insurance recovery. You guys have been kind of bracing for that. So, it's -- glad to hear that it seems like that is kind of starting to arise. It seems like you might be laying off a little bit on the guidance for the next quarter. But if I look at just the back half of the fiscal year guidance, I'm looking for maybe a little bit of color if you can unpack some of those key assumptions mainly on insurance. I think you guys -- the past second half peak you guys saw, I think that was probably FY 2021. So, maybe as a starting point, if you guys could maybe shed some light on the assumptions you're making relative to that past peak, maybe how much further down you're expecting within that guidance?\nDoug Valenti: Yes, John, the -- and you touched on it, the main variable in the range of guidance for the remainder of the year is, of course, the exact slope of the insurance ramp. We don't know exactly what it would look like. What we do have from clients are consistent and broad-based indications of continued steep ramp. Some pretty specific about where they want to get within the next few months, some less specific, but equally bullish and very important, more importantly, from pretty much every auto insurance client we have, which is very different from where we were last year when we had a strong quarter, but it was really kind of one client that was driving that surge. Rather than giving you -- so the numbers are based on the buildup of a range of assumptions based on what they've told us and our own information on what capacity we have in media, what budget we're likely to get from what players and how those are likely to come together. So, as I said, it's impossible to predict precisely because there are too many moving parts. But what I think we tried to say in the prepared remarks is that it's consistently, bullish, consistently a steep ramp, and a lot of good data in there that kind of builds up to the range of outcomes that we have. I would say that we -- if we're going to air therefore, we're likely to be a little bit more conservative in this quarter because we're still earlier in the ramp than we will be next quarter, I guess, is something you noted -- and I would say that, that would be our bias. I'm not suggesting that the guide is -- trying to characterize the guide. I'd suggest given that we're earlier in the ramp, and therefore, there's a little bit less fully known you would expect that to be the case. But as we run a series of scenarios, with a lot of bottoms-up buildups and a lot of input of data from things like media capacity. And we have a much bigger media footprint now, by the way, than we did last time we peaked in auto insurance, as an example. This quarter, we will be nowhere near the past peak of auto insurance revenue as to our guide. Next quarter, the range runs from below that peak that peak a little bit beyond that peak. So, you can see that we're kind of balancing out various symptoms. Does that answer your question?\nJohn Campbell: Yes, that is very helpful. Because I think some of the questions we get is just looking at optically, the growth rate looks pretty substantial for the fiscal 4Q, but I think the message is that getting to that high end of that of your guidance range is not assuming heroics relative to the past peak? Is that fair to characterize?\nDoug Valenti: Absolutely fair. Yes, it's -- by no means in the realm of heroic or anything if you looked at the data and the inputs you go, gosh, you're never going to get the look we're highly confident in our guide for this quarter, which is a $45 million ramp over last quarter at the midpoint. It would -- to get to -- depending on how we do this quarter against that guide, you're talking about another $20 million to $30-ish million at the bottom end of the range. and beyond. So, I don't think it's -- we don't believe it's a road. We think it's in the range of what we would consider realistic reasonable fact-based assumptions.\nJohn Campbell: Okay. All very helpful. And then one last one here, just kind of housekeeping. But on the CapEx, I mean you guys have always kind of operated with light CapEx. I've noticed that, I guess, year-to-date, fiscal year-to-date, CapEx is like double up relative to last year and I think the year prior to that is like 4 times higher. So, it seems like definitely a focused investment happening there. I don't know if you're at a stage now where you can shed some light on that, but I'm curious about what's driving that?\nDoug Valenti: Yes. No, it's a great question, and you're exactly right. We have been accelerating and being very aggressive in our software capitalization, software development, which gets capitalized, of course in the QRP area mainly, driven primarily by demand and by the signing of a couple of very large accounts, and we wanted. And so the combination of that and having made sure the product was fully ready to launch with those big accounts early this calendar year. And anticipating and seeing an increase in demand and activity for that product as the insurance market has come back, drove us to invest at those rates and to those levels. I can tell you that we're pretty much at the end of that cycle and you're going to see that capitalized software development cost drop pretty significantly this quarter forward. That wraps pretty much through the snake, if you will, super excited. I mean, super excited about where that product is, about the intention we're getting, about some of the big accounts we've signed, about the opportunity there, and that will only get better and better. We believe as the insurance market continues to come back, of course, -- that was pretty dormant there for a while because there really weren't enough carriers participating in the market to make it worth the while of the various brokers and agencies to invest and a product like that. But we have seen that turn pretty dramatically over the past couple of months.\nJohn Campbell: Very encouraging to hear. Thanks for the time guys.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Day of B. Riley Securities. Your line is already open.\nDan Day: Yes, thanks for taking the questions guys. Just -- would be good if you could comment from a state level. I know there were a number of big states that have effectively been shut off since April or so of last year. Maybe if you could just comment with what's come back in January. Like are those larger states being turned back on in a meaningful way? Any commentary there would be great.\nDoug Valenti: Sure Dan. You are correct, a lot of big states have been shut down by a number of carriers in some states, pretty much all the carriers. We have seen some re-openings of some major states by major carriers. Of course, it's a map with a lot of different participations by different carriers. So, not all the carriers are opening all the states at the same time. But I can tell you that we have seen some big states reopened by major carriers and by a number of carriers, and we've been told to expect that to continue. And we have gotten indications of some of our major clients that they would expect to be reopened in all major states and back to what they consider to be a normalized demand, which we are nowhere back to yet, by the way, by mid-year -- by mid-calendar year.\nDan Day: Okay, great. Sounds like good news. You guys said in past quarters, you've broken out the growth in the credit-driven vertical specifically. I didn't hear any commentary this quarter. Maybe I missed it, but can you just give us some color on how the personal loans, credit cards, other connection verticals performed and the outlook for the next couple of quarters?\nGreg Wong: Yes. The -- let's say, well Home Services, you didn't ask about home services, you talk about grew about 15% is our second largest business, our third largest business. And by far, the biggest component of credit-driven verticals is personal loans grew 18%, 18% year-over-year in the quarter. Credit cards was actually down a little bit versus the previous year, but it was just nothing to see there other than a real tough comp. Credit cards gets driven -- peaks and valleys get driven by limited time offers or promotions. And last year, in the December quarter, there were a lot of good promotions in the quarter. This year, there really weren't any new big promotions in the quarter. So, we would expect that to even itself back out as we get -- as promotions start rolling back out this quarter and next quarter. So, -- and those are the big components. So, those are 90-plus percent of the credit-driven.\nDan Day: Okay, great. Appreciate it guys.\nDoug Valenti: Yes, thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark [Indiscernible] of Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is already open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. So, it looks like you had some strong growth in the Home Services piece, but I was wondering if there was anything you could say around any impact you saw with rising rates and what that may add on Home Services lead generation?\nDoug Valenti: That's a great question, Mark. But nothing that we could discern. We think, generally speaking, in our experience and in talking with our clients that higher rates are having a number of effects. One effect is, of course, you're having consumers stay in their existing home. And that's a good thing because they're going to say, well, I'm going to stay here because I don't want to lose my mortgage. And so I'm going to invest in this home. And so that, I think, continues to be a theme in Home Services. We're trying to make sure that we're participating with our clients in those product and service areas that align with that. Beyond that, you could assume that it may be tougher for consumers to invest in bigger projects because of interest rates if they need to borrow. We haven't seen that in a meaningful way that we know of and we continue to believe that Home Services as a market for us is a double-digit grower on average for as far as yes, I can see, we're super early. It's massive. And it's just a great fit for QuinStreet. So that's kind of -- that's how I would answer the question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. That’s helpful. Thank you very much. That’s all I have.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Goss of Barrington Research. Your line is already open.\nJim Goss: All right. Thank you. Doug, I think you might have addressed this a little bit with -- in terms of the media footprint and capacity. But I was wondering if you could provide a couple of metrics that you can give us to point to evidence of the inflection point having been reached. Is it volume of inquiries? Are there certain things that we might take away just in terms of how we view that as section having been achieved?\nDoug Valenti: All right. I think the main one is one I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Jim, and that what you're referring to, but we're -- our auto insurance revenue will be up way over 100% this quarter or last quarter. That's inflection. The demand by consumers and traffic by consumers driven by the higher rates and the fact that now you have more options coming to market because of the clients' opening states and increasing their participation, we saw a 30% jump in consumer traffic, shopping online for auto insurance in January over December. And so -- and then if you look we could give you more detail on that just client-by-client, and it's almost every one of our clients in auto insurance is up dramatically versus where they were in the calendar fourth quarter. So, again, I think it's a lot of different metrics and land clients in states but the bottom-line metric is on 120%, 130% growth, something like that quarter-over-quarter, this quarter versus last quarter, and indications and by the way, an accelerating and accelerating. I mean the amount of budget we had in December was -- began -- was meaningfully better than November then we had that surge, I just talked about percentage-wise in January over December. And we've grown -- and that has accelerated in February, where we have significantly more budget in February, and it's if more states in February than we had in January, and we have indications of clients that they -- from almost all of our clients that they want to reach significantly higher levels, including in some very large clients getting to normal footprints, which means pretty much all states on uncapped with us. And today, no or near all states are open and they are capped in terms of their budgets at this point as they control their ramp by June. So, those would be the, I think, the main things that would reflect the rent.\nJim Goss: Okay. And I know you mentioned the unpredictability of any of these things these cycles. And no two cycle is going to be exactly the same. But do you have -- does history suggest any degree of sustainability of the rebound? Is it -- does it tend to be a long-running thing? Or do you -- does it happen pretty quickly when it happens as dramatically as it's been happening right now?\nDoug Valenti: It's a good question. When I talk about it being unpredictive audit, I don't mean it's not predictor. I said the exact slope is unpredictable. It's impossible to predict. What I'd say that is predictable that it is sloping and it is ramping and it looks like it's going to be quite steep. The sustainability is, again, a very important and good question, particularly given what we went through a couple of years ago and then last year, I would say here are the indications from us at the sustainability. One of the fundamentals, if you look at the reported combined ratios and/or profitability of the auto insurance carriers over the past couple of quarters, dramatically better, dramatically better and consistently better than they were, last year, the year before and the year before that. So, that's very, very important because first and foremost, their economics have to work. The combined ratios are better dominantly because they've taken rate. I know it's gotten rate increases. They've had three years of compound double-digit rate increases, generally speaking. And that has given -- and also along the way, they've adjusted their footprint and their product to adapt to adapt the economics better. So, it's not just rate, it's also making other adjustments. And as a result of that, we're seeing fundamentally combined ratios and profitability reports very strong from all the major carriers in that you guys have seen that. You will continue, I think, to see that. I'd say the third thing is the breadth of the participation. Last year, in the year before, the surge in the January quarter was very focused and narrowly so on one or a couple of carriers. We are seeing it this time amongst all of our carrier clients. I don't think it's an exact -- I can't think of one that hasn't significantly increased their spend with us, most importantly, but also their outlook for increasing spend going forward with us, and have increased their activity much more broadly and all the other things they're doing, whether it be QRP engagement or participation with agencies or all the other stuff. So, the activity level is higher and the activity level is higher broadly, and I would go so far to say virtually amongst all of them, whereas last year, it was not so. So, that indicates to us -- and by the way, the way to talk about future months is quite specific and bullish, and credible time. So, I'd say that participation is also and the way that participating is also important. Your question about how long it lasts is a great one. If you look back at what they call kind of hard and soft markets, I think they call them an insurance. Typically, the cycles are much, much shorter for the bad markets than we've seen over the past few years. That's why Greg referred to it as generational, I referred to it as a fierce storm -- macroeconomic storm. This has been the worst auto insurance cycle in anyone's memory because it was such a deep, fundamentally hard thing to get out of between the COVID's effect on driving behaviors, but also on inflation and supply chain. And including things like tough used car markets and because there weren't enough new cars to buy. I mean it was a very tangled mess of complexity. They really had a very dramatic effect on insurance carriers and it's taken them a long time to untangle it much longer than usual. Usually, these cycles are more like, I don't know, maybe a year, the down cycle then usually get several good years after that. I am not in an industry -- at Insurance industry analyst, but I think if you read the analysts that follow the industry, their view is likely to be that this is -- we're likely at the beginning of a multiyear positive cycle because of all the carriers have gone through on the product side, on the footprint side and now all the rate increases they've had. So, we're subject to big weather events, which are really short cycles. I think we're -- we feel like and the clients seem to be indicated that the outlook is quite positive for as they can see.\nJim Goss: Okay. Thank you. One other little myth. Someone mentioned he had heard from an agent that there are certain states unwilling to ensure certain cars because of at risk that have come up in the past couple of years. Are there -- is that -- are you seeing things of that nature or any other were things that would factor in any of the--?\nDoug Valenti: No, it's a good question. There are things like that in the market all the time. But nothing that fundamentally affects the trajectory, not that we would expect to fundamentally affect the trajectory now. But there's a lot of -- I mean they're a big neighbor because of California nobody would cover home insurance, of course, they are big parts of -- I mean, there's lots and lots of stuff like that, but the overall trend of the market from here appears to be up and to the right.\nJim Goss: All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Kreyer of Craig-Hallum. Your line is already open.\nJason Kreyer: Great. Thank you. Doug, just wanted to see if you could give us more color on the dialogue you're getting from carriers. I know in past cycles, the resurgence of spend has been kind of driven by digital first carriers with more of the captive agencies, a little bit behind them? Are you seeing that play out now? Or are you seeing a little bit more increased spend out of both buckets?\nDoug Valenti: More out of both, actually. We reviewed the auto insurance market and business with the Board recently at the last Board meeting and one of the slides showed how much more diverse the footprint was for us and by implications in terms of overall industry demand than it was last year for this quarter. and pretty dramatically so, I would note. So, we are seeing it more broad-based than we have seen in past cycles. I think that's generally the case. But I think it's also specific to us because we do have a bigger footprint now than we did last cycle. We have a broad -- we participate much more broadly in in other parts of the digital landscape, we used to be dominantly clicks now we have clicks, calls, leads, services like QRP, things like that. So -- but we appear to be seeing it and again, this is anecdotal, but we appear to be seeing it more broadly in answer to your question.\nJason Kreyer: That's great. So, as the re-ramp continues to build, I'm just curious what you think your prospects are for taking market share over the next several months?\nDoug Valenti: I think it's good. We have not lost a share on the media side. In fact, we've significantly gained share on the media side through this period. We've recently signed very big player in media that we're going to be adding to that already win cycle as we launch that in the next month and a half or two months. And I don't -- nobody has been able to invest in the products that expand the market and expand our footprint in that market like we have through this period because we had the wherewithal to do so. We didn't have debt. We did have -- we had positive cash flow we have or positive operating cash flow case adjusted EBITDA, if you will. And most of the other players in the market had debt and/or we're much more deeply tied to the auto insurance cycle or how do the problems like mortgage and just did not have the capacity to do what we've been able to do in terms of aggressive investment through the cycle. And we've invested in are things that we expect have and we'll continue to build not just to grow the channel and grow our footprint in gene also take share. We've gained share, we think we'll continue to do that.\nJason Kreyer: Just one more, if you don't mind. You teased out some data or just some statements earlier on QRP. I know you don't want to break out numbers or contribution. I'm just curious maybe how big you -- like rate of change, how big that can become? Or at any specific point in time or you think that can be a bigger contribution and more meaningful to your fundamentals?\nDoug Valenti: Yes, it's a good question. We've only invested in that product because we do think it's going to be very big for us. We think tens of millions of dollars is exactly what it ought to be and it could be bigger than that, particularly if you look at the side effects of it and the combination of it with other ways to service the channel. So, we think it's many tens of millions of dollars in opportunity. We think it's a market that's over $100 million in the addressable market. over time, we don't expect we'll get 100% of that market. That's why I say maybe tens of millions of dollars. But we do think we're way ahead of anybody else in terms of the product and where you go with this product. it will ramp with a little bit of a lag to the overall market coming back because you have the market coming back and marketing spend and clients participating and then you have the agencies revving up because now they have participation in product and now they're willing to invest in and work on projects like QRP, which allows them to be more efficient, more productive in the market than they would be -- they can be without it. . So, I think it will lag, but we clearly see a ramp. We expect quite a significant ramp this year to -- when I say this year, I mean the remainder of this calendar year and next fiscal year, we would expect to ramp back up. We're already running at seven figures, but low we would expect that to be mid to high seven figures certainly next fiscal year and the fiscal year after that. I'm hoping that we can get well beyond that and start reaching for the eight-figure number. So, it's meaningful and that revenue is very, very high to contributing, right? It's not a normal 30%. Incremental revenue in QRP is generally going to be about 80% to 85% as you get to just a little bit more scale. So, we think it's highly accretive big market opportunity. We don't -- we haven't -- we'll probably have an Investor Day here in the next -- as long as the Insurance ramp keeps going like we expect it to, I would expect we'll have an Investor Day in the next six to 12 months where we will get in more detail about QRP and where we are with that, we'll introduce maybe a couple of the big client programs that we now have running by the way, either one of which could be well into the seven figures and beyond all of themselves. So, these are signed contracts, signed clients. So, we're -- we like it a lot. It's still coming. It was certainly delayed by everything else that was delayed in auto insurance, but we have seen a lot of resurgence of activity and have had a lot of success with big signings recently that are in the launch and ramp stages over the next few months, and we'll be talking more and more about it as we move ahead. And we'll start breaking it out at some point in the future, I imagine, but we're going to get back on our feet and start trotting again with it before we do that.\nJason Kreyer: Got it. Thanks for all the color Doug. I appreciate it.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Sakai of Singular Research. Your line is already open.\nChris Sakai: Hi, good afternoon Doug and Greg. Just a question on Q4. It seems like a lot of growth is being put on to Q4. What are the chances do you see auto insurance not ramping as fast as you want to get to this Q4 -- these Q4 numbers?\nDoug Valenti: I'd say that we have that in the range, Chris. I think we have -- we said 5% to 15% for the year covers a lot of territory at our scale. So, we would -- we think there's -- certainly means we think there's a chance we won't get to the high end. I think there's a chance we will do better than the low end, but we're -- we like to ramp, as I said earlier, this quarter over last quarter, we're representing about a $45 million ramp over -- in terms of sequential growth. The bottom end of the range, I think beyond that represents another $20-ish million or so depending on where we land in the range $20 million to $25 million, I guess, been where we land in the range on top of that sequentially. So, we're not -- we're actually reflecting at the bottom end of the range, a slowing of the sequential ramp. But even though we're seeing right now an acceleration of the ramp in auto insurance. So, again, as I said earlier, I think the -- we still think we're going to end up in that range. The exact point where we end up in that range is going to be pretty dependent on the slope of the auto insurance re-ramp. And while it's deep, it's hard for us to predict precisely the slope and so that's really kind of reflected in what you're seeing. But I'd say that's how I would characterize it. And again, it's mostly driven by the auto insurance ramp. But of course, we've still got a lot of great initiatives and growth and momentum in Home Services, which is the $200-and-something million in your business and first loan, which is a $100-and-something-million business and credit cards as we see more promotions in the market is likely to benefit from those. So, the footprint all in all, but again, I'd say that where we end up in the ramp is going to be dependent mostly on exactly how that -- what that slope looks like without insurance. But we don't think the top end is crazy. We don't think -- and we think the bottom end is something we're pretty comfortable with.\nChris Sakai: Do you -- in a strategic way, do you -- have you thought about trying to diversify away from this auto insurance these swings in auto insurance?\nDoug Valenti: No, I mean we will diversify -- we have diversified, right? We have -- beginning of this auto insurance cycle, I don't think I don't know, home services, Greg, is it more than doubled through this period.\nGreg Wong: You're probably right.\nDoug Valenti: And personal loans has probably doubled through this period. So, we've taken -- we've pretty dramatically increased our footprint and diversified through this cycle because we found great new market opportunities that are great with QuinStreet, we didn't do that to diversify away from auto insurance. Auto insurance, we believe, is a great market for us forever. It's a great market. We have phenomenal capabilities. We have a great media footprint. We have the best products and services in the market. We have very close relationships with the great clients that are the best players in that industry. Auto insurance is going to be driven by marketing for as long as any of us are going to be watching it because of the nature of their business model, which is rates are controlled by regulatory authorities. And so if you're going to grow shareholder value over time, you're likely going to have to grow that by gaining market share. rather than by expanding margin or pricing because your margin and pricing are controlled regulated at the end of the day by -- I'll overstate this for 50 state insurance commissioners basically. So, hey, we structurally we love it. It's a big market. We have a great position in it. We're going to keep doing it. We think we'll grow it to many times at current size with the initiatives we have in place to continue to do that and we will grow other client verticals too. And we think that our footprint in Home -- we think Home Services is our biggest addressable market, significantly bigger than auto insurance over time and we've shown we can scale that. We're going to keep doing that. We think personal loans is as big or bigger depending on how you define the lending market where we've shown we can scale that. We will continue to show we can scale that over time. We love our position there. And we like the other credit-driven businesses and credit cards and banking, which are earlier stage. But combined now, we're approaching $100 million a year. in revenue, and I think we will soon eclipse that to just those two together. So, we have a good footprint is diversified. It will include auto insurance and a lot of expansion of products and services around auto insurance and home insurance, everything else going forward.\nChris Sakai: Okay. Thanks.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. Thank you everyone for taking the time to join QuinStreet's earnings call. Replay information is available on the earnings press release issued this afternoon. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."

Following prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Investor Relations and Finance, Robert Amparo. Mr. Amparo, you may begin.\nRobert Amparo: Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining us as we report QuinStreet’s fiscal first quarter 2024 financial results. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Doug Valenti; and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Wong. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the following discussion will contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that may cause results to differ from our forward-looking statements are discussed in our recent SEC filings, including our most recent 8-K filing made today and our most recent 10-K filing. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions as of today, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.quinstreet.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Doug Valenti. Please go ahead, sir.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you, Rob. And thank you all for joining us. FY Q1 was another successful quarter. Non-insurance revenue grew 18% year-over-year and represented 79% of total revenue. We continued to invest in important product and growth initiatives across the business, including in staying positioned to take full advantage of the revamp of auto insurance client spending. We did all that while continuing to deliver on our commitment to maintain our strong financial position, once again demonstrating operational and financial excellence and the resilience of our business model. Auto insurance clients are communicating their intentions for calendar year 2024, and those indications support our expectation of a significant positive inflection in their spending, beginning in January. We are spring loaded for that inflection and would expect total company revenue to jump dramatically in the back half of the fiscal year and adjusted EBITDA to grow faster than revenue. We expect auto insurance revenue to be even further up and to the right over the longer term, eventually returning to and exceeding prior peak levels as carriers benefit from compound rate increases, product optimizations, and cooling inflation and supply chains, thus allowing the shift to digital and performance marketing reassert itself of the dominant long-term trend. Turning to our outlook. First for the current fiscal year which ends next June. We expect full fiscal year 2024 revenue to grow between 5% and 15% year-over-year, implying as I indicated earlier, a significant positive inflection in auto insurance spending in the back half. Auto insurance clients are giving us considerable detail about their footprint and budget expansion plans for January forward. While it is still difficult to predict the exact scale and slope of the auto insurance revamp, our bottoms up estimates imply expected total company quarterly revenue in the second half of the fiscal year to average over $180 million per quarter. We expect quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin in the second half to be between 5% and 10% of revenue. For the current quarter, our fiscal Q2, we expect total company revenue to be between $113 million and $118 million, in line with typical sequential seasonality. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $0.5 million and positive $0.5 million. We will, of course, continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and strong overall financial position and discipline. Finally, our long-term outlook has never been better. We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the revamp of auto insurance client spending, and to expand our product and market footprint in that important client vertical. We also continue to scale our non-insurance businesses, which now total about $400 million in annual revenue and grew 18% year-over-year last quarter and at a 19% compound annual growth rate over the past three years. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Greg.\nGreg Wong: Thank you, Doug. Hello and thanks to everyone for joining us today. For the September quarter, total revenue was $123.9 million. Adjusted net loss was $1.4 million or $0.03 per share and adjusted EBITDA was $1 million. Non-insurance revenue was $98.5 million or 79% of Q1 revenue and grew 18% year-over-year. Looking at revenue by client vertical, our financial services client vertical represented 58% of Q1 revenue and was $72.1 million. We continue to see excellent performance from our personal loans, credit cards, and banking client verticals, which grew 33% combined. Our home services client vertical represented 40% of Q1 revenue and grew 6% year-over-year to $49.4 million. Our strategy to drive long-term growth here is simple: One, grow our business from our existing 15 or so service offerings, examples being window replacement, solar sales and installation, and bathroom remodeling, none of which we believe are anywhere close to their full potential; and two, expand into new service offerings where we see the opportunity to at least triple the number of these sub verticals we currently serve. This multipronged growth strategy is expected to drive double-digit average annual growth for the foreseeable future. Other revenue was the remaining $2.4 million of Q1 revenue. Turning to the balance sheet, we closed the quarter with $56.3 million of cash and equivalents and no bank debt. As we look ahead into Q2, I’d like to remind everyone of the seasonality characteristics of our business, as I do every year at this time. The December quarter, our fiscal second quarter typically declines about 10% sequentially. This is due to reduced client staffing and budgets during the holidays and end of year period, a tighter media market and changes in consumer shopping behavior. This trend generally reverses in January. For fiscal Q2, our December quarter, we expect revenue to be between $113 million and $118 million, in line with typical sequential seasonality and adjusted EBITDA to be between a negative $500,000 and a positive $500,000. In summary, let me reiterate Doug’s earlier points. One, we are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the re-ramp of auto insurance client spending, which we expect to begin in January. Two, we will also continue to scale our non-insurance businesses, which now total about $400 million in annual revenue and grew 18% year-over-year last quarter. And three, we expect total company revenue to jump dramatically in the back half of our fiscal year, and we expect adjusted EBITDA to increase even faster. With that, I’ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Campbell with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Bass: Hey guys. This is Jonathan Bass on for John Campbell. It looks like the home services segment saw a little bit of deceleration this quarter. Can you give some color on what you’re seeing there and then maybe what specific verticals are seeing slower growth?\nDoug Valenti: Yes. Jonathan, home services grew, I think it’s 6%, as Greg reported, year-over-year. We expect home services to grow this full calendar -- or sorry, this full fiscal year at double digits, which has been the case for the past several years there. So I kind of -- I guess I kind of say nothing to see there. Just some quarters, between things converge in one way and other quarters they converge in others. So, I don’t expect that there’s no -- nothing to see or nothing to report in terms of any structural deceleration.\nJonathan Bass: Okay. Got it. And then, with your commentary around the expected insurance marketing spend coming in January, do you guys have any insight on what the potential trajectory of the spend could look like throughout the year?\nDoug Valenti: We don’t have -- we have some input on that from clients there. There is at least one client that’s given us very specific numbers in terms of what their plans are by state and coverage for the first half of calendar ‘24, which of course would be the second half of our fiscal ‘24. They haven’t given us much color beyond that, just general guidance in terms of their hopes and expectations for the year. So trajectory wise, what we are assuming is that the ramp will begin in January and be a pretty significant inflection as we’ve said for the past few quarters, and that -- and a pretty big step function increase over the December quarter’s numbers, which are running along multiyear lows, as you know and that that ramp would continue and go up in the June quarter based on what clients have told us their plans are. Very typically, the March quarter is a peak, and then we go down a little in the June quarter. But based on what the clients are telling us, we actually expect to have the step function up from December to the March quarter, and then they continue to ramp up and to the right through the June quarter. And then, probably typical seasonality will kick in, which would be pretty flat June to September quarter. And then, as Greg said, a downward shift in the December quarter as we work through that sequential seasonality.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\nJim Goss: I was wondering, Doug, how many of your various insurance carrier clients are exhibiting the types of signs that would support your optimism about a sharp turn? And how varied do you expect the timing of any recovery among those plans to be in terms of, not all happening at once perhaps, but maybe it’s over a several weeks or several months period. What do you think -- I know you said you don’t really know the scale and the slope, but maybe there’s a little more color you can give to those expectations.\nDoug Valenti: Yes. Jim, I’d say, the majority of our carrier clients have expressed that next year, in particular, and most beginning in January, will be a higher spend year for them in the channel because of their success in getting rate increases over the past few years and because of a cooling inflationary environment. To your point, they have varying degrees of plans for how and where they’re going to ramp, some with decent specificity. Fortunately, some of our bigger ones have given us that kind of level of detail, and others with less. But on balance, what we’ve done is we’ve taken the -- and then the inputs from all of the clients, and we have very good and probably the best relationships with these clients in the industry. And we’ve gotten -- taken their inputs, and we’ve done a bottoms up estimate based on also media availability and expected traffic patterns and pricing. And we’ve put together our best bottoms up, and that is a big part of what results and the range we gave you for the year. We know you can do math, so we won’t bore you what you would have figured out anyway, which is based on our guidance, even at the bottom end, we’ll be doing actually an average of about $185 million a quarter in the second half of the fiscal year. As I said, probably a little bit of a ramp from Q3 to Q4 given what we’re hearing from the insurers. To give you a little bit more detail on that, this might be help answer your question, to bracket it maybe a little bit for you. We expect auto insurance -- we do not expect auto insurance in the March quarter, even though we expect to do $180 million in revenue in that quarter on average, but the other quarter -- and the second quarter -- I’m sorry, that and the fourth fiscal quarter our second calendar quarter up to $180 million, $185 million. We don’t expect our insurance to reach the same level we did last March quarter. So, this coming March quarter, despite the big jump in our revenue, we are not projecting that our auto insurance revenue will be as high as it was last March quarter, and we expect a ramp from the March quarter to the June quarter. But even in the June quarter, we don’t expect yet that auto insurance revenue will reach the revenue levels of auto insurance last March quarter. So, we’re not going way out on a limb here. It’s going to be a big step-up, but it’s only a big step-up because we’re down so low in auto insurance, and then a multiyear low, as you know. And I would remind you that the peak auto insurance quarter for us revenue wise was a couple of years ago in the March quarter, and that was $90 million. And the last March quarter’s revenue -- auto insurance revenue, which I said we’re not going to get to in the March or the June quarters based on our current forecast, was $63 million. And so, we got a long way to go to keep -- get back to the peak, which we expect to do over the next couple of years, maybe shorter time than that. But we’re -- the step function up is well in line with what you would assume to be kind of reasonable expectations of a revamp, particularly given relative to, again, a year ago and peak, if that’s helpful.\nJim Goss: Okay. A couple more things, if I might. When education was your dominant business and you hit a wall, you did have a rebound develop in some of these other areas. And I’m wondering, as Greg was saying, with the potential to do more within certain areas and/or other areas within home services as well as some of the financial areas, did you see some internal competition among your various sectors trying to become that next great thing, even though you’re hoping to have that return in the auto area, and then you’re running on more cylinders? And, also, are there other insurance areas within these multi line carriers you deal with who -- that would benefit from the same sort of technology you employ, even though they might not be required, like auto insurance or that sort of thing, but that might offer some other opportunity within those companies.\nDoug Valenti: I’d say that we have a number of next great things going on. We just grew -- our non-insurance business is 18%. We’ve grown 19% on a compound annual growth rate basis, and they’ve all grown at strong double-digits. That’s not being carried by any one of those client verticals. We’ve said, I think, a number of times that home services may well be our biggest addressable market. And as Greg has pointed out, pretty straightforward path to continuing growth there by growing the service areas or the trades we’re currently in, and then adding other trades or service areas. And we see a good strong opportunity and path there. So certainly, we expect continued great growth and strength in home services. Also, in our other financial services verticals, non-insurance financial services verticals, I think Greg pointed out, would be 33% year-over-year in the quarter. And those businesses are approaching $200 million in annual revenue now, if they haven’t already gotten there. And those -- and again, the home services is over $200 million in annual revenue. And we see tons of -- those are all big markets, banking, credit cards, personal loans, enormous markets. We’re very early in all of them. And I think they -- folks that run those businesses certainly believe that they have the opportunity to create many, many hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, and a couple of them certainly think they can get to $1 billion based on just simple analysis of wallet share and market size, opportunity to expand the footprint.  In terms of the expansion footprint, insurance, we have opportunity to expand footprint in all of our client verticals including insurance. It’s a good question. We’re dominantly in insurance -- a click to direct carrier model and certainly one of the two, if not the premier company doing that in the channel. And that’s only half the market. The other half the market, which is largely served by the lead aggregator networks is -- leads and calls, primarily to agents instead of direct carriers, and leads and calls instead of clicks. And so, yes, you’ll see us continue to expand our footprint. We won’t do it by mimicking the current lead aggregator model, because we think that’s both tired and over-capacitized, but we are -- we have created a number of opportunities for us to continue to expand our business there, and we’ve expanded quite dramatically this year, in fact, in that part of the market and expect that we will be able to continue to do that for many years. There are also other components of insurance, sub-verticals of insurance, if you will, like commercial, which represents an enormous opportunity that we’re early into. But, most of our big multiline carrier clients also serve that industry, and it’s mostly small business and that’s a good fit with us. So, we are expanding there and we’ll continue to expand there. And of course, we’ve talked a lot about QRP and the rating platform and the opportunities that opens up for us to serve agencies in a whole new way with the integrations we already have and to create opportunities with them that are broader than what we can do directly with the direct carriers or with the carriers, even with the ones that have big agent network components. So, yes, a lot of new dimensions of insurance to come. Step one will be getting the insurance market healthy again, which it looks like we’re on the cusp of. There was a large client that had a call today that described their plans for their budgets next year as robust is a great word, we like that word, and it’s consistent with what we’ve heard from them and what we know the plans are going into next year. So, a lot of opportunity to continue to grow. And we certainly don’t think that we are anywhere near to the point of slowing down our scaling or penetration of any of these markets, all of which are quite big. So, we are -- we consider ourselves a multi-billion-dollar revenue opportunity company. And just the question is how many multis we can get to.\nJim Goss: Thanks very much. Seems diversification is your friend.\nDoug Valenti: Thank you, Jim. I think it’s -- yes, absolutely.\nJim Goss: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kreyer with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.\nCal Bartyzal: This is Cal Bartyzal on for Jason. First question for me, I guess, given we continue to see new highs in mortgage rates, do you think that gives you guys a longer duration growth opportunity at home services with maybe people continuing to look at renovations over moving?\nDoug Valenti: We do. Yes. No, I mean, you described it exactly right. So really not much to add, but we are -- and do believe we will continue to see that.\nCal Bartyzal: And just last one for me. Can you just maybe extrapolate out personal loans a little bit between loans and credit repair? I’m just curious if personal loan side is just -- obviously you guys put up strong growth rate, but just as it continues to maintain a strong trajectory despite tighter credit, higher lending rates, things like that?\nDoug Valenti: Yes. We have a broad portfolio of lenders, and we have seen timing, just like everybody has over the past year or so, maybe a little bit more than a year. Now, I think that’s being offset by the fact that we do have a broad set of lenders that cover a lot of different credit bands, a lot of different types of loans. We’re continuing -- we’re constantly expanding that, and we’ll continue to do so to make sure that we can serve a greater and greater number of consumers and media. We also have a, I would say, the best offerings of other solutions for consumers from credit repair to debt settlement, high quality providers of those services, and that can really help consumers do whatever their credit challenge might be. And I think that that is a big part of our being able to better serve media because we have the opportunity to have a solution for more consumers. And it’s a big part of why we’ve done better than most of the other players in this market over the past year plus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Day with B. Riley Securities.\nDan Day: On the insurance side, I know you don’t provide like a quote request metric or anything along those lines, but just in general, like these rate hikes starting to get passed to consumers, I’d have to imagine that shopping activity is pretty active right now. I don’t know if there’s not kind of any demand to meet yet. So just anything directional you can provide on quote requests or any other relevant metrics you think are important that supply is there? We just need the demand to come back as you think it will in January?\nDoug Valenti: Yes, Dan. I think you’re right on it. With all the rate increases, we’ve seen pretty significant increase in shopping consumers in auto and home insurance, as you would expect. People get the rate increases. They may think, gosh, maybe I can go get it cheaper somewhere else. That’s particularly exacerbated by the fact that you’ve got for some folks, big inflationary effects on other parts of -- their personal income statement and a little bit of a slowing economy theoretically, although we had a pretty robust growth rate last quarter. So, I think it depends on the segment, but generally speaking, we are seeing increased shopping. I think one of the other companies in this space that they’re seeing record consumer shopping for insurance. I don’t know if we’re seeing record, but if we’re not, we certainly are seeing a significant increase over a year ago, which was an increase over two years ago, all driven by the rate increases which have been averaging double-digit for a couple of years now, I think three years actually. So we are seeing a lot of shoppers. The problem is there are so many insurers that aren’t in market right now that those shoppers aren’t finding -- aren’t finding what they’re looking for. And so, the quote -- we’re getting a lot of requests or a lot of traffic, but you wouldn’t necessarily translate that into “quote requests” because there aren’t enough insurers in the market to match them and give them a quote request. So, it’s difficult to say how that metric would play out given the dynamics in the market, but the main metric that matters right now is shopping and shopping is up. And it looks like based on what we’re hearing from carriers the next year, there’ll be a lot more alternatives for those shoppers and a lot more options for those shoppers, which will result in a heck of a lot more quotes and -- quote requests and then quotes.\nDan Day: Just, second one on the M&A environment. You’ve been pretty quiet on this front for a while now. Just anything interesting out there, and just any areas you’d be looking to tackle on if there is something out there that presents itself?\nDoug Valenti: Yes. We’ll continue to be opportunistic and active. We’ve made a few small acquisitions over the past year or so, smaller. We are always looking, we’re always open, for things that add meaningfully and, to our verticals, and we’ve got a couple in the hopper right now that we like a lot. Neither of them are real big, but they could be really impactful. We like those best. Of course, it’s great to find a company that has done well at their scale that we can kind of plug into our network and ramp and scale much more rapidly, and that’s kind of our favorite opportunity. And we’ve got a couple of those in the hopper right now that we’re pretty excited about, and I’m sure there will be more. We’re also being conservative because of the insurance environment and the fact that our adjusted EBITDA is kind of at the breakeven level, so we’re not replacing the cash we’re using. We’re mindful of that. But it hasn’t caused us to pass on anything that we’d really like to do yet. And as I indicated, we expect to return to pretty robust cash flow levels in the second half of the fiscal year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bruce Goldfarb with Lake Street Capital. Please go ahead.\nBruce Goldfarb: Are you guys planning any changes to the cost structure to drive margins higher and take advantage of the ramp?\nDoug Valenti: We already have. We’ve positioned ourselves to take great advantage of the ramp, including being very mindful of cost over the past few years. I would point out that if you did the math on the top-line leverage that we lost over the past few quarters, we should not have done as much EBITDA as we did. We did that because we have been very focused on margin, costs in order to make sure that we were able to sustain positive adjusted EBITDA margins due to the period where we lost so much top-line but also to be prepared to really bounce up very rapidly as auto insurance comes back. So, short answer is we have and we will continue to. But we’re trading that off against making sure that we’re continuing to invest in great growth opportunities too. And I think we’ve made a -- I think we’ve done well balancing those two competing objectives. In fact, I’d say we feel like we’ve done about as well as we can. We’re very good about where we are.\nBruce Goldfarb: Great. And I don’t know if you break out customers, but could -- what percent was Progressive in terms of percent of revenue for the quarter, if you’re willing to do that?\nGreg Wong: This is Greg. Progressive was 3% of revenue.\nBruce Goldfarb: 3%. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just my last question. Some of these larger insurance programs that you’re talking about, do they give you visibility for almost the whole year? I mean, do you get like a -- some of your bigger customers?\nDoug Valenti: They give us general objectives for the year and general plans for the year, subject to stuff happening, like how bad is the hurricane season. So I would say they give us general views of what their objectives will be and how they’re thinking about the coming year, and then, varying degrees of detail couple of quarters out, and then pretty good detail coming -- before a coming quarter. And then, typically those are decently accurate subject only to, again stuff coming up that they didn’t expect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Sakai with Singular Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Sakai: To start, a question on the revenue guidance that you gave of 5% to 15%, I just wanted to know, is that somewhat of a downgrade from the previous quarter when you said that you would expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at double-digit rate?\nDoug Valenti: I’d say, it’s a -- being more specific for you. I mean, double digits covers an awful lot of ground, right? And so, we just decided that now that we know more going into the back -- as we go looking at the back half and this quarter that we would bracket it. I would point out that the middle of that range is double digits, 10%. And we still maintain that even if auto insurance were flat year-over-year, we’d still grow double digits because of the strength of non-insurance. So, we there is no downgrade here. There’s no lowering of expectations. We’re just giving you more specificities to the range and all the things we’ve said previously are still true.\nChris Sakai: Okay, sounds good. And then, to go back to personal loans, so in June, it had a very good month. How did the months this quarter compare?\nDoug Valenti: I’m sorry. I didn’t quite understand the question. Chris, ask again, please. \nChris Sakai: I guess, as far as revenue goes -- from personal loans is concerned, I recall June was a very good month. How does that compare...\nDoug Valenti: Yes. It’s been -- personal loans continues to perform exceptionally well for us. I think Greg, pointed out that personal loans, credit cards, and banking together grew 33% year-over-year, and personal loans is more than half of the total revenue of credit cards, banking, and personal loans is personal loans. And so, you could extrapolate from that it had a really good quarter last quarter. Greg, did I get that right?\nGreg Wong: Yes, you did. And just to add on to that, it was a very good quarter. You’re right, Chris. The June quarter is very strong for personal loans. And I would add that the March quarter or the -- I’m sorry, the September quarter that we just finished was also a record quarter for personal loans. So, very strong performance.\nChris Sakai: And then --- so by the third and fourth quarter, are you guys expecting that all your segments will be growing sequentially?\nDoug Valenti: I’d have to look at the -- I’d say that third fiscal quarter, yes, over second fiscal quarter. I’d have to look at going from third fiscal quarter to fourth fiscal quarter. Typically that is more -- it comes down from the peak in March as our typical seasonal pattern. But as I said, auto insurance is expected to actually ramp from the March to the June quarter. The other businesses are probably expected to be flat to down a little if typical seasonality holds. Greg, do you have that in front of you? I don’t know if that’s.\nGreg Wong: Yes. No. That makes sense. That exactly makes sense. Yes.\nChris Sakai: Okay. Sounds good. And last for me, I guess, you were seeing last quarter as far as expecting for improvements as far as in auto insurance. Are you still seeing that? And are you seeing what you expected last quarter play out into this quarter?\nDoug Valenti: I think we said last quarter that we expected a significant positive inflection in auto insurance to begin in January, and we exactly continue to expect that. This quarter, the current -- the December quarter, we expect it to continue to be a quarter where auto insurance was challenged, until they get to January and reset their combined ratio targets, and get new budgets. And so, that’s -- continues to be the case this quarter. It’s about like last quarter in auto insurance, and that’s exactly what we expected. And we expect -- we said we expect the January quarter to begin a significant positive inflection or the March quarter depending on how you want to think about it, and we still, I expect that as we said. And we’ve gotten a little bit more granular because we’ve gotten more specific indications in terms of as best we can, doing a bottoms up on what that means for the range for the entire business in the back half and for the year. So, yes. I guess, the short answer is yes.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. Thank you everyone for taking the time to join QuinStreet’s earnings call. Replay information is available on the earnings press release issued this afternoon. This concludes today’s call. Thank you for joining us."
