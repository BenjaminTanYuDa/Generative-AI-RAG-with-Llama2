At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMaria Riley: Good afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections, and expected performance, including our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled risk factors in the company's quarterly and annual report. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP. A discussion of why we use non-GAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on the investor relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our form 8-K filed with the SEC today. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurtz: Thank you, Maria. And thank you all for joining us today. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. It was another quarter of records. Record net new ARR of $282 million, continuing our acceleration trend, growing 27% year-over-year. Record operating margin of 25%, up 10 percentage points year-over-year. Record free cash flow reaching 33% of revenue and a free cash flow Rule of 66. Record GAAP profitability and record cloud identity and next-gen SIEM ending ARR of greater than $850 million together, more than doubling year-over-year. These results illustrate CrowdStrike's substantial and widening competitive moat, exceptional business acceleration, and validated market leadership. Building on my founding vision, CrowdStrike is the only single platform, single agent technology in cybersecurity that solves use cases well beyond endpoint protection. Falcon is the easiest and fastest cybersecurity technology to deploy, and our single AI native platform makes vendor consolidation instant, frictionless and natural. The feedback we receive from customers, prospects and partners alike is consistent, eagerness to deploy the Falcon platform, ease of adopting more Falcon platform modules, and excitement from continuous innovation with new Falcon capabilities delivered weekly. Leaving stitched together point products and PowerPoint platforms behind, CrowdStrike customers realize the benefits of superior outcomes and lower TCO. A recent IDC report echoes this, showcasing $6 of return for every dollar invested in the Falcon platform. That is ROI. Free is never free. Customers understand the difference between product pricing and the total lifetime cost of operating inferior technology. Given the Falcon platform's ROI and TCO savings, we believe we will continue to see favorable pricing dynamics. I'm thrilled with our performance, which is a testament to the execution and passion from the very best team in cybersecurity. Unified by our focused mission, we stop breaches. My gratitude to all CrowdStrikerâ€™s on a job well done. Our execution and discipline across the business, coupled with overwhelmingly positive market feedback, gives me strong conviction in our fiscal year 2025 momentum, which Burt will cover in more detail. The current macro environment remains stable and consistent with prior quarters. We expect continued deal scrutiny throughout this coming year. We remain focused on operational excellence, while delivering market-leading growth at scale, assisting organizations of all sizes to consolidate and improve their cybersecurity. In contrast to the macroeconomic backdrop, the state of the threat landscape has never been more elevated. In CrowdStrike's recent 2024 Global Threat Report, we unpack the harsh realities of cyber today. Key findings include: first, attacks are faster than ever. What took adversaries hours has shrunk to minutes and seconds. Attack speeds will only accelerate. Second, the cloud is increasingly under attack. We tracked a 75% increase in cloud intrusion attempts. The cloud is today's battleground for cyberattacks. And third, generative AI is an adversary force multiplier. GenAI puts advanced cybercrime tradecraft in the hands of attackers of all skill levels, Gen.AI will dramatically grow the adversary population. The Global Threat Report showcases our threat intelligence leadership. We collect trillions of threat signals daily, creating one of the world's largest and fastest growing cyber threat data sets. From day one, we've been an AI company, training the industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks based upon our data moat. Embedded in the Falcon platform is a virtuous data cycle where we collect cybersecurity's very best threat intelligence data, build and train robust preventative and generative models, and protect CrowdStrike customers with community immunity. Our team of data science PhDs operate this continuous and real-time process, constantly evolving Falcon's AI foundation to predict adversary activity and stay ahead of threats. Our ever-growing data corpus and unique access to Cyber's freshest data at the source alongside our technology and our human incident response, threat analysts, data science, and engineering expertise, together serve as a structural competitive advantage. Along with AI, cybersecurity is a top priority in my discussions with numerous boards. In today's environment of heightened cyberattacks, the latest SEC breach disclosure regulation only increases the pressure on companies and their boards. We regularly assist boards with regulation readiness by bringing cybersecurity from the back room to the boardroom. This, alongside the severity of the threat landscape, makes effective cybersecurity an increasingly mission critical necessity. That said, cybersecurity today is a frenetic vendor bizarre. Disjointed point feature copycat products clutter the market, attempting to band-aid symptoms instead of curing the illness. OS vendors use their market position to create a monoculture of dependence and risk, and in many cases serve as the breach originator. Even worse, multi-platform hardware vendors evangelize their stitched together patchwork of point products masquerading as thinly veiled piecemeal platforms. And what organizations inevitably realize is that, vendor lock-in leads to deployment difficulties, sky-rocketing costs, and subpar cybersecurity. The outcome is shelf wear and sunk costs. ELA and bundling addiction become the only way to coast customers into purchasing non-integrated point products. If the organization trapped in these fragmented pseudo platforms riddled with bolt-on point products that are the ones suffering from fatigue. In stark juxtaposition, what CrowdStrike customers tell us is that, when you build the right single data-centric AI platform, deliver the right frictionless native solution, and architect the right go-to-market organizations purchase because they need more, receive more, and understand how cybersecurity transformation saves them time and money. Our deal metrics validate this. First, record deal volumes. In Q4, we closed more than 250 deals greater than $1 million in deal value, more than 490 deals greater than $500,000 in deal value, and more than 1,900 deals greater than $100,000 in deal value. Deal counts grew by more than 30% year-over-year across all deal segments. Second, record platform adoption, deals with eight or more modules more than doubled year-over-year. And lastly, continued rising win rates. In Q4, we saw steadily rising win rates across the board, validating our technological leadership over the competition. These results are driven by the following: the winning AI platform, the right solution, and our frictionless go-to-market motion. Let me begin with our winning AI platform. The secret to cybersecurity's leading platform is our single platform has one console and one agent. It solves an ever-expanding set of cybersecurity and IT use cases. Our single platform is open. Our single platform is data-centric, AI native, and scalable, delivering immediate times of value. Key wins prove the value of the Falcon platform, which makes point product consolidation and vendor replacement a reality. A recent seven-figure win in a Fortune 1000 company highlights how our platform consolidates at scale. Falcon replaced an OS security vendor, a legacy AV vendor, and a next-gen vendor. We eliminated multiple Microsoft consoles and multiple agents to a single console, single agent, and single platform of Falcon. Our platform approach organically inspires customers to deploy Falcon cloud security as their first CSPM, CIEM and ASPM. solutions. An eight-figure multi-year win in a Fortune 100 business where the Falcon platform displays five different products. With recent breaches costing them hundreds of millions, it costs too much to keep using ineffective cybersecurity tools. They purchased EDR, Next-gen AV, Identity, file integrity monitoring, and vulnerability management, reducing the number of agents on their devices by approximately 50%. What used to require five installs is now done with one. There are countless similar stories. Our platform approach makes landing with multiple solutions at once easy and adopting increasing capabilities over time and organic experience. We collect data once and reuse it many times for today's and tomorrow's use cases. Our application of GenAI makes cybersecurity predictive and accessible for all skill levels. It's all on one platform, one agent, and one integrated workflow. Next, delivering the right solutions. Our market-leading cloud security, identity protection, and next-gen SIEM solutions are in demand, because they solve painful customer problems. These businesses collectively are more than doubling year-over-year. Each are IPOable businesses and each play lead roles in Falcon platform consolidation. I'd like to start with our breakout cloud security solution where we are setting new records and winning at scale. Our cloud security momentum accelerated in the quarter with net new ARR growing nearly 200% year-over-year. At more than $400 million in ending ARR, CrowdStrike is one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market and was recently positioned as a market leader in Forrester's cloud security wave. Here are a few recent cloud security wins. An eight figure multi-year win in a hyper-growth AI company. This company's endpoint footprint is in the low thousand. However, with its rapidly expanding cloud estate, this transaction marks our largest inside sales deal of all time. Falcon Cloud Security protects their LLM development and cloud environment. This customer uses CrowdStrike for CSPM, CIEM, CWP and ASPM. From the SMB to large enterprises, our sellers and partners win with Falcon Cloud Security. A leading hyperscaler grew its use of Falcon Cloud Security, praising our Linux capabilities. This large eight-figure transaction takes us deeper into the account where we're not only on every device, but now across large parts of their cloud. The win extends CrowdStrike leadership in securing the world's largest clouds. A global financial services giant replaced their Palo Alto Prisma Cloud products in a large seven-figure deal. The Palo Alto cloud security products required separate management consoles and separate agents because cloud security is on a separate Palo Alto platform altogether. CrowdStrike was able to deliver an expected 70% time reduction in management as well as more than $5 million in annual staffing cost savings. The patchwork of multi-product, multi-agent, multi-console, separate platform technologies resulted in visibility gaps, asynchronous alerts, and overall fatigue managing cloud security. Falcon single platform with its integrated cloud security components was a win for the customer. Customers are starting to realize that CSPM doesn't stop the breach. It is a compliance and reporting tool. Cloud security has moved beyond CSPM. Customers are increasingly realizing that a holistic suite encompassing runtime protection is the only way to protect from active real-time threats. CrowdStrike built the first native single agent and agentless cloud security solution. We've taken cloud security beyond CSPM to include CIEM for securing cloud identity, ASPM for locating, controlling, and securing cloud applications, CWP to stop malicious behavior and breaches. And now we turn to securing the cloud data itself that flows in and out of the cloud. Turning our cloud security focus to data, we're incredibly excited to announce our intended acquisition of Flow Security. Flow stood out as the most unique technology amongst a sea of early startups by delivering the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. Let me explain. The majority of companies in cloud data security focus on two things: discovery and classification. Here's where Flow stands apart. Runtime data discovery and classification. Data is analyzed, pre and post-decryption, enabling precise and instant results. Real-time and continuous data visibility, a live view into data risk, not just at rest but also in motion with LLM-powered adaptive policies. Data leakage prevention, the ability to block data exfiltration, including the data exposed through GenAI services. Simply put, Flow is the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. Flow will also enhance our native data protection module, which is off to a great start already replacing legacy DLP products in Fortune 500 accounts. Customer frustration with legacy DLP is at a fever pitch, similar to the days of legacy AV, where outdated products overstayed their welcome. We will now be able to offer a cloud centric next gen alternative, addressing a market currently shackled by ineffective legacy vendors, estimated to be an $8 billion TAM in CY 28. With Flow, we will have the most comprehensive data protection from code to application, to device to cloud focused on stopping breaches. Next, let's look at identity protection which surpassed $300 million in ARR, more than doubling year-over-year. Q4 was also a record quarter of net new identity customer adds. With 80% of attacks involving identity vectors, we've made identity protection standard fare for modern cybersecurity, because it is already integrated into our single agent. Other vendors attempt to offer identity protection through non-integrated afterthought features or simply lack identity protection altogether. Our identity threat detection and response module remains the market's only single-agent solution that stops lateral movement, protects credentials, and secures where identities are actually born, active directory. Wins from the quarter include a seven-figure deal with a mega cruise line using a next-gen product that can never be fully deployed. Upgrades and operations were a disaster. When I personally met with them, they were beyond frustrated with being the quality control test bed and tired of too many incidents that slipped past their current vendor. Our identity solution delivered in one, not two agents, sets the Falcon platform apart. An eight-figure transaction with a major chip manufacturer added identity to their Falcon deployment. Trapped in a large Microsoft ELA, this organization realized Microsoft needed to bring in a startup to augment its current offering. This piecemeal approach to identity protection created a massive burden of deploying another unproven agent. The customer saw the immediate value of Falcon identity. Our single agent and single platform approach reduced their Microsoft dependency. Lastly, let's discuss LogScale next-gen SIEM, an inflecting Falcon platform solution. We added record net new next-gen SIEM ARR in Q4, growing over 170% year-over-year. As of the end of Q4, our next-gen SEIM-ending ARR is now greater than $150 million, selected by well over 1,000 customers. Our next-gen SEIM is quickly emerging as the go-to splunk alternative for all businesses looking to leave legacy SEIMs. Following M&A consolidation in the legacy SEIM market and mounting dissatisfaction with a slew of withering SEIMs, the market is hungry for better technology, lower TCO, and instant time to value. In LogScale next-gen SEIM, all CrowdStrike data is already resident, saving the expense and time of data transfer. Customers are looking to standardize on the right cloud-native data centric platform for actioning their data, where they're manually searching, using automated AI power queries, or trusting partners to manage their next-gen SIEM Falcon experience. With pipeline already in the hundreds of millions, there's overwhelming interest in LogScale next-gen SIEM. One of many noteworthy wins from the quarter was in partnership with Deloitte, which has a hyper-growth LogScale next-gen SEIM practice. Together, we closed a seven-figure multi-year next-gen SEIM deal with a large European manufacturer displacing Splunk and [Elastics] (ph) and beating out Azure Sentinel. This customer now has 16 Falcon platform modules deployed. A major mobile computing company standardized our LogScale next-gen SIEM in a seven figure multi-year deal, replacing a legacy SIEM. We competed against Palo Alto's XIM. The customer was looking for an open architecture versus a closed, vendor locked-in approach to cybersecurity. The complexity of having to deploy many different Palo Alto products and multiple agents made CrowdStrike an even easier choice. Lastly, a Fortune 500 hospitality brand grew its relationship with us, again, displacing Splunk and Azure Sentinel in a seven-figure deal. In partnership with EY and their global LogScale next-gen SIEM practice, this customer grew their SIEM use cases by bringing in security and IP data more than before, retaining that data for years and benefiting from faster searches. LogScale next-gen SIEM was significantly faster than Azure Sentinel, with a substantially lower total cost of operation, which helped drive this win. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM wins illustrate our sticky and growing data gravity within businesses of all sizes. I can confidently say LogScale next-gen SIEM is one of the fastest growing SIEM solutions on the market today. Our pace of innovation has never been faster. We're incredibly excited to announce that Falcon for IT and Charlotte AI are generally available. As our customers look to solve increasingly complex IT challenges across their heterogeneous environments, Falcon for IT excitement is palpable. Our customers are also excited about the GenAI productivity gains from Charlotte AI, where over 80% of our beta users believe they will save hours to days of work each week using Charlotte AI. The third and final driver of CrowdStrike's growth at scale is our frictionless go-to-market. I'm a big believer that customers don't buy what they don't need and should never be forced to do so. At Falcon, we announced Falcon Flex, a flexible licensing model where we enable customers to use the products they want, when they want, over the course of a multi-year subscription term. Falcon Flex drives customer stickiness, enabling larger lands and helping us expand with customers adopting more Falcon platform solutions faster. A recent noteworthy Falcon Flex deal was a multi-million dollar transaction with a Fortune 500 technology company that leveraged Falcon Flex to go all in with Falcon, consolidating and displacing legacy IT hiking products, point cloud products, and legacy DLP products. The right platform, solutions, and go-to-market make us the partner ecosystems leading choice. Some partnership highlights include: accelerating momentum with Dell. Since announcing our Dell partnership last year, we've transacted more than $50 million of total deal value together with customers in every segment and geography. We're in the early innings of where this partnership is going, and I'm thrilled with the momentum that we have with Dell as they standardize new offerings, such as their own MDR service on Falcon. Our MSSP business is growing by triple digits year-over-year, fueled by the right technology, strategy, and partners. MSSP increasingly want the platform, not part of the platform, to power cybersecurity transformation. MSSP are bringing Falcon to tens of thousands of SMBs who lack the staff and time, but still need the outcome of the industry's best cybersecurity. Our AWS Marketplace business continues to accelerate at scale, surpassing $1 billion in sales. The AWS Marketplace continues to be one of the fastest growing routes to market. A vast majority of our Marketplace business also transacts through resellers and SIs, where we've unified partners and cloud marketplaces for ease, speed, and end customer value. The Falcon platform is validated, tested, and certified. Industry analysts regularly recognize Falcon in our leadership. Here are two recent examples. First, the Gartner's EPP Magic Quadrant. Our placement speaks for itself. CrowdStrike's positioning as highest inability to execute and furthest to the right in completeness of vision and this year's Magic Quadrant solidifies our unequivocal market leadership ahead of Microsoft and every other vendor profile. Second, the farthest away for cloud security place CrowdStrike as one of only two leaders in the entire cloud security market, ranking highest provision and innovation. In conclusion, CrowdStrike single agent, single unified data centric platform, and our mission to stop breaches sets us apart. In starting the company, we brought cybersecurity to the cloud. We pioneered AI for cybersecurity. And we've quickly become the de facto security platform that disrupts, displaces, and consolidates other vendors. I couldn't be more excited about the year we completed, as well as our bright future. CrowdStrike's contribution to cybersecurity goes beyond technology. It's the power of the Crowd. We are cybersecurity's community. When cybersecurity professionals apply for jobs, CrowdStrike certification is the required skill set. In the reseller and ISV ecosystem, CrowdStrike is at the top of the line card. In SOCs across every vertical and geography, CrowdStrike is the security operating system. It's CrowdStrike that's on the screen. When talking about the threat landscape, CrowdStrike pioneered commercial threat intelligence that governments and companies of all sizes depend on. It's CrowdStrike that delivers billions of new threat detections every month to stop the breach. It's CrowdStrike that is the search bar of security where analysts complete millions of XDR queries daily. It's CrowdStrike that created cyber security's first dedicated GenAI stock assistant to make every user a power user. It's CrowdStrike where more than half a million cybersecurity defenders log in every day to protect society by stopping breaches. The technology, the crowd, the mission, This is what makes CrowdStrike cybersecurity definitive platform. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nBurt Podbere: Thank you, George. And good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and a record finish to the year, highlighting our outstanding execution, growing market leadership, and accelerating adoption of the Falcon platform. For the full fiscal year, we achieved 34% and 36% ending ARR and revenue growth, respectively, while delivering significant leverage on the bottom line. Operating income grew 86% year-over-year to reach a record $660.3 million, or 22% of revenue, and net income attributable to CrowdStrike and EPS more than doubled to reach a record $751.8 million or $3.09 per diluted share. Free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year to reach $938.2 million or 31% of revenue, exceeding our target for the year. Additionally, we are very proud to have achieved the important milestone of GAAP profitability for the past four quarters and full fiscal year in less than five years following our IPO. Our achievements in fiscal year 2024 represent another high watermark for CrowdStrike. Through our consistent focus on execution, we have efficiently scaled the business, growing ending ARR by over 10 time from our IPO in fiscal year 2019, delivering significant operating leverage and growing our free cash flow margin profile to above 30%. We continue to aggressively invest in our innovation engine and flight the company to achieve its vision of reaching $10 billion in ARR over the next five to seven years. Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $282 million, up 27% off of last year's record Q4, representing our second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. And we finished the quarter with $3.44 billion in ending ARR, up 34% over last year. Demand in the quarter was broad-based and we have a record Q1 pipeline as we executed on our platform strategy, closed many large consolidation deals, and extended our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. While companies may be fatigued with other vendors, they have embraced CrowdStrike's platform strategy and want to buy more of the Falcon platform. This is evidenced by: first, the number of deals with eight or more modules more than doubling year-over-year in Q4; second, subscription customers were five or more, six or more, and seven or more modules growing to 64%, 43%, and 27% of subscription customers respectively; third, the number of customers with greater than $1 million of ending ARR growing to more than $580; and finally, the growth of deals with total value exceeding $1 million accelerated to over 30% and reached an all-time record at over $250 million in Q4. We finished the year with 29,000 subscription customers, which excludes smaller customers served through our MSSP partners. We are landing bigger with new customers on average, adopting 4.9 modules out of the gate, an increase over last year. Our gross retention rate remained high at 98% and our dollar-based net retention rate was consistent with last quarter at 119%, which is slightly below our benchmark as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. For the interim FY 2024 quarters, net retention was 119% in Q3, 119% in Q2, and 122% in Q1. Looking into FY 2025, we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to fluctuate within plus or minus a few points of 120% as the business scales to even greater heights and customers continue to land bigger and with more modules. Moving to the P&L, total revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $845.3 million. Subscription revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $795.9 million. Professional services revenue was $49.4 million, representing 26% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of fourth quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the U.S., 16% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 10% from the Asia Pacific region, and 6% from all other markets. Total gross margin increased by 282 basis points year-over-year to reach 78% and subscription gross margin was above 80% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 291 basis points over the prior year. Our strong gross margin performance was driven by our ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by the Falcon platform, as well as our continued investment in data center and workload optimization. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $448.1 million, or 53% of revenue, compared to 60% of revenue in the prior year. Our strategic investments in talent and innovation underpin our ability to scale the business and deliver profitable growth. In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 123% year-over-year to reach a record $213.1 million, and operating margin increased by 10 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 25%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 grew to a record $236.2 million, or $0.95 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 248 million shares. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to a record $3.47 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $347.0 million. Free cash flow reached a record $283.0 million, or 33% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis. Before I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business, including larger deal sizes, increased win rates, and a record Q1 pipeline. However, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook amid a macro environment that remains challenging, and therefore the guidance we are providing today assumes a consistent, challenging macro backdrop. Second, while we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, given the incredible performance of Q4, I will share our current seasonality assumptions with respect to net new ARR and Q1, which calls for Q1 net new ARR year-over-year growth to be at least double digits up to the low teens. Third, given our strong momentum in the market, we are increasing our pace of hiring in FY 2025 as we continue to invest in our innovation engine and go to market functions to scale the business to $10 billion of ARR and beyond. As a result of increased hiring in the first half of the year, changes to the timing of our merit cycle and the timing of certain marketing programs, we expect operating leverage to be more weighted to the back half of FY25. Next, we are raising our free cash flow target for FY 2025 from between 30% and 32% to between 31% and 33% of revenue. Our assumptions on interest income and expense, CapEx and cash outlay for taxes will be included after this call in our earnings presentation available on our investor relations website. Moving to our outlook. For the first quarter of FY 2025, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $902.2 million to $905.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 30% to 31%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $188.1 million to $190.8 million. And non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $220.4 million to $223.1 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.89 to $0.90 cents utilizing a weighted average share count of 248 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,924.9 million to $3,989.0 million, reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 31% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $863.6 million and $913.0 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $940.3 million and $989.7 million. Utilizing 250 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.77 to $3.97. George and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your question please, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here and congrats to the team on a strong finish to the year.\nGeorge Kurtz: Thanks, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: George, short thing. George, maybe for you. I think the number that sticks out the most to me from the quarter is the $850 million in ARR from maybe what I'll call platform products. So the question is, can you just talk about the competitive landscape in a couple of those areas like cloud security and SIEM? I mean, definitely a rising tide in some of those markets, but also some good competitors. What do you think is giving CrowdStrike a right to win in those markets?\nGeorge Kurtz: Thanks, Saket. Obviously, a key part of our success has been that all of the modules [indiscernible] are platform, which is really key driver. And when I started the company, it was really about creating this data platform that allowed us to ingest data at scale and then create multiple use cases. And really what you're seeing is many, many years of hard work that allow us to solve use cases beyond just core endpoint protection. So when we think about cloud security, customers are really looking to rationalize the alphabet soup of cloud products that are out there. And they're looking not only for posture management, but runtime protection. And they want it all integrated into a data platform. So I think given what we've done and some of the acquisitions including now Flow, we are obviously well positioned in that area and a lot of interest from our customers, and we've seen a lot of success. When we think about the SEIM market, and maybe more importantly, the legacy SEIM market, customers are just frustrated with the existing technologies, the cost structure around those. And what they're looking for really is a data platform like CrowdStrike and now LogScaleâ€™s natively integrated into the product. It's a better way to give them the outcome they want, which is faster results, better overall outcomes, and a lower TCO. So I think it's this data concept that we've been talking about for many years that everyone now is starting to see the fruits of our labor and how we can solve use cases well beyond just endpoint protection. Bert?\nBurt Podbere: Yeah. So I would agree, George. I think at the end of the day, for us, when we're thinking about the different products that are in our portfolio, it's really about the platform. We sell the platform. Regardless of what are the products that are in the platform, they all kind of work off of each other, and we're just out there solving as many outcomes as we possibly can.\nSaket Kalia: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Essex: Great. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question -- for taking the question and great to see the strong results from the team. George, you're articulating a few thoughts on consolidation pricing in your prepared remarks, but wanted to ask a little more directly and maybe follow up to Saket's question. Both for you and Bert, one of the other vendors in this space has talked about a strategy of platformization. So maybe with that in context, how does this impact your go-to-market and pricing?\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, thanks, Brian. As you might imagine, I heard a lot about platformization over the last week. To me it's kind of a made-up-so-gazey term, but what I believe our competitors are talking about is bundling, discounting, and giving products away for free, which is nothing new in software and security software. It's been done for the last 30 years. So when we think about what we've seen in the past with other competitors, we know free isn't free. And what customers are saying is more consoles, more point products masquerading as platforms create fatigue in their environment. And one of the things again that we've been focused on is that, single agent architecture, single platform, single console that allows us to stop the breach, but more importantly, drive down the operational cost and supply many use cases or solve many use cases that are out there. So, I've been around the block for a bit. I've seen this movie of wrap and roll and bundling together with multiple products that were acquired and last time I saw that I was at McAfee. So I don't know, Bert, you have anything to add to that?\nBurt Podbere: Yeah, I think, George, look, at the end of the day, we sell on value. And we've never been a company that's done deep discounting. We've never been a company that has increased our prices to get more ARRs. That's not us. And at the end of the day, for us, we're here to help customers get the greatest amount of outcomes at the lowest TCO period. And to George's point, free is not free, and good is not good enough.\nBrian Essex: Thanks, Bert.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, Rob.\nRob Owens: Yeah, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could address the modest step up in billing's duration. After a year of compressing durations, your total billings outgrew your short-term billings and it does appear that customers are committing for longer contracts, wondering if that's a function of your consolidated platform or another dynamic in the market. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Hey, Rob. So I think it's a couple of things. One is, for sure it's about the platform. But second, Q4 is historically we've seen a lot more of the multi-year deals. We also see more renewals in Q4 as well. But billings in general, remember it's a noisy metric right? It's heavily influenced by duration and timing of deals within the given quarter. But having said that, at the end of the day, we do manage the business to ARR. And that's the one that we focus in on. Billings for us is just an aftermath. You're right. It was a strong billing quarter, but that's not really how we run the business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you, and congrats on the great execution as well. George, just a follow-up for you on the data market or the DLP market, and congrats on the acquisition of Flow. Just curious how that will be integrated. You didn't really mention how big that is for you guys, but obviously a very big market that is right for disruption and maybe talk about the competitive dynamics of that market as well.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. Well, we're excited about this because not only do we get the classification of data, but we also get the runtime protection in the cloud. So it's a perfect fit for our data protection module. And again, what I talked about in prepared remarks was that, there's a lot of similarities to what I saw when I started the company in legacy AV to legacy DLP. I don't even like the term DLP we call data protection, because it's really about how data flows and data in motion not only in a company's organization but through all of their cloud and all of the applications. So I think it's a perfect fit. We're excited about the team. We're excited about the technology that will be integrated, of course, as part of our platform. We spent a lot of time on that, making sure the customer has got the right user experience. And we'll get this acquisition closed out in the next couple of weeks, and then we'll be heads down with the integration. But so far, so good on our data protection module. We've got some wins there and a tremendous amount of interest in replacing the legacy DLP technologies.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your question, please, Andrew.\nAndrew Nowinski: Thank you for taking the question. This is just a really amazing quarter again, particularly in light of some of the noise that's been in the market. So I wanted to ask about the expanded partnerships with Dell that you announced today, and also about the -- I think, the Pax8 partnership that you announced at your user conference last year. I guess first, how did both partners contribute to results in the quarter relative to your expectations? And then second, have you factored in a contribution from those partners into your F 20Y25 outlook? A - George Kurtz I'll take the first part and I'll turn it over to Burt. So we obviously are very excited about the Dell partnership. I'll start with them. I talked about that earlier. And really, we're in the early innings. We're winning deals, large enterprise, all the way down the SMB, taking advantage of their reach and their go-to-market motion. So still early days, and we've already put up some big numbers from that partnership. When we look at Pax8 and the like, again, it's still early days, but we've seen tremendous success, particularly down-marketing the SMB, and what customers are looking for, even if the smaller customers are looking to solve big problems, they can't be hit by ransomware, they can't have an impact to their business. So it's a perfect model for us to get to those SMBs. And it's, like I said, early days, but tremendous results so far. Bert?\nBurt Podbere: Yeah. So I think that we're very excited about both the partnerships, both Dell and Pax8. They represent additional routes to market, but it's still early days on both of them, as George had mentioned. But they're one of many routes to market. We do believe that they're going to bring deals to us. And we're excited to have them on board as partners.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead, Tal.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. So we had discussions this kind of past few weeks about the pricing environment of the XDR market and the ability to offset this with add-on modules. And the question is, you touched on it, but I want to ask, do you feel the contribution of Microsoft and Cortex from Palo Alto and others, do you feel their impact on pricing of individual components of your package? And is there a story about price compression of each individual component offset by the bundle or that you just don't see the XDR pricing pressure that Paolo Alta was talking about? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, again, I mean I can -- I try to focus on what we've been able to do. And as the leader in the space, we've been solving problems for a long time. And when we look about -- we look at the impact that ransomware and some of these very prominent breaches have had, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for companies. So to buy a platform that has the capabilities to stop breaches is really what customers are looking at. And when we think about sort of one-off modules or things of that nature, for us, we're looking at the total package and the solution of what we put together. And of course, it's a competitive environment, but you have to have a competitive product, you have to have the right level of innovation, and you have to have the right go-to-market motion, which we talked about in some of the prepared remarks. So it has been competitive. It has -- will be competitive. But at the end of the day, what we're finding is that customers want the right outcome. And we've seen the free is not free, and we see that good enough is not good enough. And I think customers are smart enough to realize the difference between price and total cost. And that's what we've been able to show with every dollar spent on CrowdStrike is a $6 return on their investment. And we're going to continue to deliver value and outcomes for customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Please go ahead, Alex.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you so much. So first thing you ever said to me, George, was that you're a platform, not an endpoint company. I think you've been proving it with high alacrity over the last year. With the comments coming in about plantation. It sounds like the response that you're having here is that the companies that are trying to do that are really just offering bundles of products, but they're not truly integrated. You're platform is based off of cloud native, microservices, API driven. And I think if you were to talk to the degree to which you integrate any acquisition into that platform, it would be radically different than what we're hearing or seeing from some of the other players. So can you talk about why the microservice cloud-native architecture in a single platform integrated upfront is the way to go and how hard it is for companies that are trying to disparate packages into a platform that wasn't designed as a platform from the get-go because I think ultimately, that's the key differentiator here. And I would think that with the acquisition of flow, you'll be able to integrate it much more rapidly because it's API-driven because it's microservice based. Can you talk to that?\nGeorge Kurtz: Yes. Sure, I can. Thanks, Alex. It's a great . And I do remember our early conversations finally, and you're absolutely right about being the platform for cybersecurity when I started the company. So when we think about architecture, architecture does matter and really what we've created is a very data-centric architecture that allows us to get data at scale into our platform leverage our AI and then create the outcomes. It's that collect once we use many. We have a single platform. Our competitors have many other platforms as they call them. We have a single agent. Our competitors have five, six, seven, eight, depending on the competitors. So when we look at our architecture, it was really designed from the beginning to solve the problems of today and the future problems. And the result of that is ease of use, the outcome that a customer is looking for, stopping breaches and lowering the cost and future bringing what they want. I've -- in a prior life, I've been involved in companies that acquired a lot of products. And I can tell you, it is near impossible to stitch all this stuff together, particularly at the agent level unless you're very diligent about it. And I can tell you from a CrowdStrike perspective, we've been very diligent about our acquisitions, as you've seen, and thoughtful on the pricing. But also what's important to realize is that we bought products and we really haven't sold some of them for the better part of 18 months because we wanted to focus on the integration, things like identity. And now we see the fruits of our labor. So it's this focused, long-term diligent approach to our acquisitions, I think, that have helped us because we started with a very innovative cloud-native platform from the beginning.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Roger Boyd of GBS. Please go ahead, Roger.\nRoger Boyd: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And again, congrats on a really strong end of the year. I wanted to talk about Charlotte. The customers that we've spoken to that were part of that early access program pretty positive on both what the product can do today as well as the pipeline and where it could go in the future? George, you said at a couple of positive stats around automation. Any updated view on your ability to monetize the Charlotte product or the time line to monetization from here? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, yes, that is the goal. We already have paying customers in Charlotte. We just released it. So the good news for us, and I think the good news for our customers is they see the value and they're willing to pay for it. Obviously, we're in the early innings of this, but the way we've architected as a foundational component of our platform, it allows us to create expertise around different areas of the platform as well as automation. Leveraging the native automation capabilities that we have. So our overall goal, again, is how do you drive automation in the stock, how do you modernize the stock? And how do you take the collective wisdom of CrowdStrike and its years of knowledge in fast categories and bring that to bear for customers big and small. And so far, we've gotten the response from customers where they understand the time savings and the value that it can bring. So more to come on this. Obviously, we just GA-ed it over the last week or so. But overall, I'm very encouraged by what we're hearing and seeing from customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC. Please go ahead, Matt.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll offer my congrats as well, guys. Burt, your new ARR commentary was helpful for Q1. I'm curious, this time last year, I believe you talked about flat net new ARR growth for fiscal 2024. And obviously, I think you guys did about 6% this year. Any just sort of like directional guardrails you give us from a full year perspective in terms of sort of just thinking about from a net new perspective.\nBurt Podbere: Hi, Matt. Thanks. So with respect to ARR, obviously, we don't guide to it. But we have talked about in the past where we've started the year in Q1 and build and that's kind of really all I can really comment on ARR. You can kind of infer where we're going with our guide. And -- but at the end of the day, our guide, the methodology has remained consistent, and that's how we think about it.\nMatthew Hedberg: So it sounds like Q1 -- it sounds like your commentary on linearity, you would expect Q1 to low point for net new growth or net new dollars for the year.\nBurt Podbere: Yes, That would be accurate.\nMatthew Hedberg: Excellent. Thanks, guys.\nBurt Podbere: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next -- actually, pardon me. Our last comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you for taking my question. Listen, as everybody said, these are really impressive results, no matter how you look at it, but especially as compared to others out there. I'd like to ask another about the past is -- I know, George, you think, but the past is the past. It's great. It's great to see. But I'd like to ask another about the future. I know Charlotte AI is the sexy new product. It's everybody or AI winner are you a loser I mean. And we'll see how that develops. But given your lightweight agent and all the data you collect or even could collect. It just seems that Falcon for IT could be a whole new world for you, which might make it harder given it might perhaps be a different buyer, but certainly worth it. I guess how should we think about the development of this product going forward, given your -- I know it just was generally available, too, but I'm sure you've had early conversations with customers.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, I've got to tell you that the customer excitement around Falcon for IT is off the charts. When we talked about at Falcon and now that's generally available, customers are looking for a better solution in this area. And one of the things that we found is that the security team has been solving a lot of IT problems and challenges for IT for a long time, and we really needed to carve out a home for IT. So when you look at some of our competitors in that market, it's -- obviously, it's a pretty big market, but having a single agent and the ability to actually solve IT problems, which many of our customers were doing already is fantastic. So again, early days, but the feedback and the interest is off the charts for Falcon for IT, and it goes to the heart of how we built the platform. To collect data doesn't have to be security data. It can be almost any data related to either our agent first-party data or now third-party data we can ingest. And that solves many use cases beyond what we originally came to market with. So I think the sky is the limit there.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to George Kurtz for closing remarks. Sir?\nGeorge Kurtz: So I want to thank all of you for your time today. We appreciate your interest and certainly look forward to seeing you at our upcoming investor events. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurtz: Thank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. I would like to begin my remarks today by expressing gratitude to our customers, who proudly trust CrowdStrike as their cyber security platform consolidator for the AI era; gratitude to our partners who win with CrowdStrike, taking our joint customers on Falcon Platform transformation journeys from device to cloud, to identity, to data and beyond; and to our team for their passion and dedication to our mission, stopping breaches, finding adversaries, and delivering the very best cyber security outcomes. Moving onto Q3. Despite a challenging macro environment and geopolitical tension, I am extremely proud of the resilience of our business and that we delivered a record Q3. CrowdStrike surpassed the $3 billion ARR milestone with an ending ARR of $3.15 billion, growing 35% year-over-year. CrowdStrike is the fastest and only pure-play cyber security software vendor in history to achieve this milestone. In Q3, we delivered double-digit net new ARR acceleration at scale, powered by customer demand for the depth and breadth of CrowdStrike's AI native XDR platform, terrific execution exemplified by rising win rate against our competitors, and acceleration in our cloud security and identity businesses, as well as a record quarter in our LogScale Next-gen SIEM business. Our standout top-line performance came in tandem with P&L discipline as our profitability soared to record heights. Q3 was indeed a quarter of records. Let me share several of our financial highlights. Record net new ARR of $223 million, representing a 13% year-over-year growth from acceleration in new and expansion business; record non-GAAP subscription gross margin; record GAAP and non-GAAP operating profitability; record free cash flow of $239 million, representing 30% free cash flow margin and achieving free cash flow Rule of 66, up from 63 last quarter. Burt will share more color on our financials and platform adoption stats, following my remarks. This was a standout quarter and places us well on the path to $10 billion in ARR that we outlined in our latest investor briefing. The market continues to validate CrowdStrike's widening leadership position. While others scaled back R&D, we are increasing our investments as innovation is the lifeblood of our company. We continue to make meaningful investments in go-to-market and profitable growth. To this end, we received multiple industry awards and accolades over the course of this quarter. Across industry analyst firms, CrowdStrike is consistently top-rated. In Q3, CrowdStrike was awarded a perfect 100% across protection, visibility and analytics detections in MITRE's latest ATT&CK testing in industry-first; recognized as Gartner Customers' Choice and one of the highest-rated in their latest Peer Insights Voice of the Customer for EPP report; named a Leader in the Forrester Wave for Endpoint Security; and positioned as a leader in the IDC Vulnerability Management MarketScape. Our leadership position is translating into record demand for our Exposure Management solution in its first quarter on the market. Our market presence in open platform approach to XDR is a uniting force in cyber security. In Q3, we hosted Fal.Con, our flagship customer and ecosystem event with more than 4,000 attendees and 70 sponsors. This was fast followed by our Fal.Con On the Road series, where we have already hosted Fal.Con Tokyo and Fal.Con Sao Paulo with thousands in attendance. The drumbeat of innovation was loud and clear with multiple releases and announcements showcasing CrowdStrike as the XDR leader, including the Falcon Platform Raptor release, which standardizes all of our customers on LogScale. This builds our platform data gravity, coupling native Falcon data with third-party data ingest, further enabling our customers to realize SIEM and XDR use cases on Falcon. Falcon for IT, a new module to unify IT and SecOps. From hygiene to patching, Falcon for IT lets customers consolidate multiple use cases and replace legacy products with our single-agent architecture. Our new Falcon data protection module that liberates customers from legacy DLP products with modern frictionless data security, which prevents data exfiltration. Falcon Foundry, a no-code application development solution, enabling both customers and technology partners to build directly on Falcon. Foundry epitomizes the true definition of a platform offering limitless apps. We announced the acquisition of Bionic, bringing application security posture management to the Falcon Cloud Security Suite. Falcon Cloud Security is the industry's most comprehensive and innovative cloud security offering, with integrated agent and agentless CSPM, CIEM, CWP, and now, ASPM. We released the beta and pricing for Charlotte AI, our AI-powered [stock] (ph) analyst, which was incredibly well received. CrowdStrike's generative AI leveraging multiple foundational models can turn hours of work into minutes, while democratizing cybersecurity, unlocking value, and adoption across the entire breadth of the Falcon platform. Enthusiasm for Falcon for IT, our automation and hygiene module for IT teams, is exciting to witness because it is something so intuitive that our customers want. Like data protection, Falcon for IT saw a clear and long-neglected pain point, where customers are forced to rely on multiple legacy products that have long outstayed their welcome. Customers are eager to consolidate their agent estate while reducing cost and complexity. Falcon for IT illustrates the power of CrowdStrike's single-platform approach. We have the real estate and data foundation to solve ever-evolving use cases, delighting our customers, while disrupting vendors that have failed to evolve. The resounding takeaway from my customer engagements at Fal.Con and throughout the quarter is that CrowdStrike is the right choice for CISOs, CIOs, executive teams and Boards. Here's why? Our build-by-design, single-platform architecture requires no integration, no stitching, and no platformization. Our unified cloud-native platform and critical beachfront real estate within the customer estate naturally create cybersecurity data gravity, solving for today's challenges, while preparing for the unknowns of tomorrow. Organizations are looking for a trusted cybersecurity consolidator. CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's AI consolidator, liberating organizations from a litany of increasingly ineffective legacy tools, multiple agents, point products, and fragmented pseudo platforms. Illustrating this point, deals with eight or more modules increased 78% year-over-year in the quarter. This is what consolidation looks like. And third, stopping the breach matters more today than ever. Adversaries continue to evolve, moving faster and increasing their use of dark AI, turning AI into a weapon for evil. At the same time, legislative and SEC regulatory oversight pressures Boards and Executives to prioritize cybersecurity. With these three takeaways in mind, let's start by expanding on the first. Why CrowdStrike is the definitive single security platform? Multiple fragmented platforms, consoles, and data silos force customers to focus on integrating, not security outcomes. Our relentless focus on innovation and commitment to a single built-by-design platform creates cybersecurity's source of truth. Built on this platform foundation, our cloud identity and LogScale next-gen SIEM products are examples of IPO-worthy hypergrowth businesses. Let's take a look at our momentum in cloud security. Growth accelerated in the quarter and we're entering Q4 with a record pipeline. Noteworthy wins in the quarter included: an eight-figure total deal value with a new Falcon customer in the hospitality vertical, where we now secure their vast multi-cloud estate as part of a broader Microsoft replacement; a seven-figure cloud security expansion with one of the largest enterprise SaaS providers, where we replaced multiple existing point products with Falcon Cloud Security; a seven-figure cloud security expansion with a major apparel brand, where we replaced a firewall hardware vendor's cloud security with our unified Falcon Cloud Security offering. CrowdStrike has one of the largest and fastest-growing cloud security businesses by ARR and customer count. The number of customers we protect in the public cloud has increased 45% from last year as we rapidly replace other cloud security vendors in the ecosystem. Point product API-based CSPMs have emerged as the easiest to replace, as the market rapidly adopts our consolidated view that together agent and agentless security stops the breach. Combined with our recently completed Bionic acquisition, we're the only vendor offering ASPM, CSPM, CWP and CIEM under a single CNAPP umbrella. Moving to Identity Threat Protection, where we delivered a record quarter. More and more companies are investing in protection from the growing number of identity-based attacks with highly visible breaches prominently covered in the news over the past few months. Identity Threat Protection wins in the quarter included: an eight-figure total deal value win in the federal government, where Falcon Identity landed as the identity security solution of choice; and multiple seven-figure wins across diverse verticals, including financial services, consumer packaged goods and manufacturing to name a few. We see a long runway for guiding organizations on their zero-trust transformations with our Identity Threat Protection, given a rapidly growing threat vector, a largely untapped market where most organizations aren't protected, and our frictionless unified architecture that secures identity across devices, clouds, domain controllers, and active directory. CrowdStrike pioneered the Identity Threat Protection category, and we are unmatched in the market as the only company with a single-agent solution for both on-prem and cloud environments. Moving to LogScale. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM business achieved new records in Q3, surpassing the $100 million ARR milestone. The combination of search speeds, data gravity, and cost efficiencies, all integrated within the Falcon Platform, sets LogScale miles apart from its competitors. However, it is the future of this business that really excites us. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM opportunity is supercharged by pervasive discontent with legacy SIEMs, recent M&A activity, and CrowdStrike's growing position as cybersecurity's platform of record. We have seen a significant and pronounced increase in interest among customers looking to leapfrog their expensive, cumbersome, and slow legacy SIEM. Our next-gen SIEM offering is the right technology in the right place, at the right time to benefit from market dynamics and the scale of CrowdStrike. Q3 wins include: a seven-figure expansion in a major consumer staples company, selected LogScale to ingest data from third parties, correlate alerts and benefit from long-term data retention; a seven-figure financial services, new customer land, where CrowdStrike was called in to stop a breach, with the desire to operationalize their high-fidelity security data without compromising on cost, Falcon LogScale was an easy choice to replace the incumbent Microsoft; a seven-figure new logo land in a business process outsourcing firm that had decided it was time to replace their antiquated SIEM with LogScale, while also adopting the Falcon Platform for XDR, Identity and Cloud Security. Our advancement into the next-gen SIEM market is accelerated by the Raptor release, which brings LogScale to the forefront of the Falcon Platform experience. With Raptor, we've made it significantly easier for customers to build their security and data lake efforts on top of LogScale next-gen SIEM across our native first-party data and that of any third-party product. Our single-platform approach evolves and broadens the aperture of cybersecurity. CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's AI consolidator, liberating organizations from legacy AV, subpar EDRs, and a hodgepodge of hygiene, compliance, vulnerability, device management tools, costly and clunky SIEMs, and a confusing alphabet soup of immature cloud point products. This lengthy list of costly point products can be left behind, saving tens of millions annually for businesses. Most importantly, stopping the breach matters more today than ever before. Adversaries don't discriminate, no matter the industry vertical, the geography, or the business size, stopping the breach is non-negotiable. The business disruption and financial losses from breaches are growing. [Cutting corners] (ph) on security is one of the most costly choices a business can make. The cost associated with cleaning up a breach can exceed $100 million. Our seminal cybersecurity platform innovation, as well as threat intelligence and service expertise, delivers the best security outcomes. This is why we win. Stopping the breach is the security outcome that CrowdStrike delivers. This makes our business incredibly durable in diverse economic cycles. We are a business necessity. A win this quarter exemplifying our unmatched capabilities is a large multinational, who was using legacy EDR until they were breached. They called CrowdStrike and we quickly remediated the breach. Seeing the power of the Falcon platform, this customer purchased Falcon Complete, Identity Complete, and LogScale next-gen SIEM for hundreds of thousands of workloads. Helping this large multinational in their time of need showcases CrowdStrike's differentiation. Our AI trained on cybersecurity's richest data set drives the industry's most comprehensive protection and automation. We couple the right technology platform with cybersecurity's best and brightest incident responders and the expertise that comes from curating the industry's leading threat intelligence. The need for stopping breaches is not just an enterprise concern. The problem is just as pronounced in the SMB market, especially the S of SMB, where businesses remain stuck on legacy signature-based AV, oftentimes not knowing that better exists for them. Falcon Go is fit for purpose, delivering big protection for their small business. With our latest release of Falcon Go, we deliver a whole new user experience, creating the easy button for cybersecurity, removing the need for CrowdStrike users to have cyber or IT skills. The new console is intuitive and pre-configured for immediate SMB success. We're always looking to remove the friction from the customer experience, and this new release makes Falcon Go as easy as one-click to accelerate customer adoption. Falcon Go is a major step for SMB cybersecurity, and we are now investing in go-to-market. We launched sales of Falcon Go on Amazon Business, a marketplace where over 6 million SMBs purchase everything for their businesses. With Falcon Go, our mission of stopping breaches extends to businesses of all sizes, large and small. Our go-to-market is propelled by our partner ecosystem. Partners bring CrowdStrike into new accounts and drive platform adoption in existing customers. Year-to-date, 62% of all our new logo wins were partner-sourced. The efficacy and success of our channel-led growth was reported by Canalys, the channel's leading industry analyst firm, in their most recent cybersecurity research. Canalys reported CrowdStrike's endpoint market share as number one, ahead of Microsoft. In addition, the research highlights CrowdStrike as the fastest-growing cybersecurity vendor in the channel ahead of Microsoft and Palo Alto networks, among others. We are setting new records. We announced surpassing $1 billion in AWS Marketplace sales. Being the first and fastest cybersecurity vendor to reach this milestone exemplifies CrowdStrike's leadership position as the cloud's cybersecurity platform of choice. And our AWS momentum is not slowing. This past quarter was a CrowdStrike record AWS marketplace quarter. Our global systems integrator alliance partners are increasingly engaging with us across the entire Falcon platform. For example, EY built a 150-person strong and growing global LogScale next-gen SIEM practice, based on the demand they are seeing for SIEM transformation and our technological superiority. In addition, EY refers their clients to CrowdStrike for incident response engagements and secure digital transformation projects. To date, we have done over $160 million in business with EY across 24 countries. In closing, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, which impacted even the largest cybersecurity vendors, we delivered a record Q3, accelerating double-digit net new ARR growth, record free cash flow, and record profitability. Surpassing $3 billion of ARR as the fastest and only pure-play cybersecurity software vendor in history to achieve this milestone validates CrowdStrike's market leadership. Our Q4 setup is strong with a record pipeline, and the competitive gap between CrowdStrike and other players in the market continues to widen. I'm excited about the path we are on and the progress we are making to $10 billion in ARR. Today's cyber environment is exactly why I built CrowdStrike. The adversary is moving faster and the rise of dark AI significantly increases attacker sophistication. Falcon has made cybersecurity easy and effective for small businesses to the world's largest enterprises. Simply put, CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's platform consolidator of choice. The platform is winning at scale. Our customers are looking to Falcon for more, more workloads, more use cases and more security outcomes. CrowdStrike remains unrelenting in our focus and promise, stopping the breach. With that, we have a busy and exciting Q4 ahead of us. And I will now turn it over to Burt for commentary on our financial performance.\nBurt Podbere: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. Additionally, the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of Bionic, which closed during the quarter and was de minimis to revenue and ARR. Outstanding execution from the CrowdStrike team resulted in a record third quarter, despite a continued challenging macro environment. Financial highlights in the quarter included: an acceleration in net new ARR growth, driving ending ARR well above the $3 billion milestone; 96% year-over-year growth in operating income and record operating margin; record net income, which more than doubled year-over-year; record GAAP profitability for the third consecutive quarter; and record free cash flow. In the third quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $223.1 million, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 13%. Demand in the quarter was broad-based, as we expanded our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. New customer acquisition, strong expansion business within existing customers and a record quarter with the U.S. federal government contributed to the acceleration in net new ARR growth and ending ARR reached $3.15 billion, up 35% year-over-year. We continue to be very pleased with our platform strategy as subscription customers with five or more, six or more and seven or more modules now represent 63%, 42% and 26% of subscription customers, respectively. Our gross retention rate remained high and our dollar-based net retention rate was slightly below our benchmark in Q3, as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 35% over Q3 of last year to reach $786.0 million. Subscription revenue grew 34% over Q3 of last year to reach $733.5 million. Professional services revenue was a record $52.6 million, representing 57% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of third quarter revenue consisted of approximately 69% from the U.S., 15% from Europe, Middle East and Africa, 10% from the Asia-Pacific region, and 6% from other markets. Our investments in data center and workload optimization that we outlined in our Fal.Con Investor Briefing in September continued to bear fruit, resulting in record subscription gross margin performance above 80% in the third quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $436.1 million, or 55% of revenue, versus $348.6 million last year, or 60% of revenue. Q3 sales and marketing and R&D expenses grew 23% and 31% year-over-year, respectively. We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and growth, while exceeding our profitability expectations. Third quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 96% year-over-year to reach a record $175.7 million and operating margin increased by 7 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 22%. As we outlined during our Fal.Con Investor Briefing in September, we have once again raised our target model, which now calls for subscription gross margin of 82% to 85%, operating margin of 28% to 32%, and free cash flow margin of 34% to 38%. We expect to achieve our new target model within the next three to five years, as we also flight the company to reach $10 billion of ARR over the next five to seven years. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q3 grew to a record $199.2 million or $0.82 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate third quarter non-GAAP EPS attributed to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 244 million shares. We ended the third quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.17 billion and reflects the $238.7 million payment, net of cash acquired for the acquisition of Bionic. Cash flow from operations was a Q3 record of $273.5 million. Free cash flow reached a record $239.0 million or 30% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis. Moving to our outlook. As George outlined, strong demand for the Falcon platform is driving our pipeline to new heights. However, the macro environment remains challenging with continued increased budget scrutiny, and as a result, we are not expecting to see the typical Q4 budget flush. Balancing these factors, we are maintaining our net new ARR assumptions, which call for in-line to modestly up net new ARR for the full year and double digit year-over-year net new ARR growth in the second half. As our guidance reflects, we are raising our full year revenue and profitability expectations for the year. Additionally, we are maintaining our target of 30% free cash flow margin for the full fiscal year. More specifically, for the fourth quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $836.6 million to $840.0 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 31% to 32%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $186.5 million to $189.0 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $199.6 million to $202.1 million. We expect diluted non GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.81 to $0.82, utilizing a weighted average share count of 245 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2024, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,046.8 million to $3,050.2 million, reflecting a growth rate of 36% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $633.6 million and $636.2 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $715.2 million and $717.7 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.95 to $2.96. George and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here, and great to see the net new ARR return to growth in the quarter. George, maybe for you, a lot of great stuff in your prepared remarks to run through, but maybe I'll just stick to one question here. You've talked about how the legacy SIEM market is starting to feel kind of like the legacy AV market did. And of course, we've recently seen some M&A in that market. It's probably too early, but maybe the question is, what are prospective SIEM customers saying to you about LogScale and their willingness to explore other solutions besides their traditional SIEM? Does that make sense?\nGeorge Kurtz: It does, yeah. It's a great question. So, when I look at the market today and I compare that to when I started CrowdStrike in 2011 and really talking to customers in 2012 and 2013 about replacing their legacy AV, it feels like it's the same conversation, just with a different context of replacing their legacy SIEM. What I found, and I tend to like businesses and markets where this is in play, is where the incumbents are entrenched, but have a high degree of dissatisfaction, where the technology is legacy and where the complexity is just high of patching all this stuff together. And in talking to customers, they want better, faster, cheaper, and they want something that works at cloud scale. If you look at what we've done with LogScale, it's a much more modern version of a SIEM, a next-gen SIEM. We got ahead of the curve a couple of years ago when we bought Humio, which is now LogScale, we've now integrated into our platform, and it's extended out our XDR technology and it allows us to do log and SIEM in the same platform. So, from our perspective, the feedback that we've gotten not only from customers but partners like EY, who are building practices around this, this is a massive opportunity for CrowdStrike, and now is the right time for us, given the level of dissatisfaction M&A in the environment and the customer's willingness to look for a much better solution, which also gives us data gravity in the platform.\nSaket Kalia: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question, please standby, comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking my question, and a good quarter on the net new ARR side. George, another question along Saket's lines, but around the comments you made with regard to data protection. The same could be said about the legacy DLP market. And as you know, I would say that's even longer in the tooth than some of the SIEM market players out there. Love to hear how you are -- you didn't talk about it like you did cloud security, identity protection, LogScale, et cetera. How far are we in that displacement market? And how big do you think they are? And what's the competitive dynamics there would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. Well, we actually showed our data protection technology at Fal.Con a couple of months ago. We're actively working with some of the largest enterprises in the world to make sure that we account for all their requirements and their ability to actually move off their legacy DLP product. There's not one customer that I've talked to that says they like their DLP product, period. And in today's environment, with data in motion, particularly through cloud services, the ability to actually be able to track from endpoint through cloud where data moves, what type of data is out there, leveraging our AI to understand, is it something that should be moving in certain places is going to be incredibly important. And the way we look at it is the same way we looked at legacy AV. There's a better way to reimagine DLP into Falcon Data Protection, and we're very, very close to being able to release that as we continue to put the fine touches on what customers are looking for and what they're willing to write a check for. So stay tuned, but another massive market opportunity for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Great. Good afternoon. George, I guess staying on theme here with these extensible adjacencies, maybe you can touch on Falcon for IT. What early response has been since, I guess, showing it at your recent user conference and where you see the opportunity on that front?\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, coming out of Falcon, I would say that was the number one requested feedback item across all the great announcements that we had. I think it's so overdue in the technology space to be able to unify IT and security. Sometimes the technology isn't the harder part, it's the org structure. So, having a single agent that both security and IT can use, a home for IT, I think is very important. We're actually working with large customers right now, gathering their feedback, and then we'll look to have a product out probably in Q1. But so far the feedback has been amazing in terms of what we've already delivered, and now we're capturing additional capabilities for our first release. So, I think that one has a lot of legs to it, and certainly opens up a massive TAM opportunity for us in IT, well beyond anything in security, given the agent cloud architecture that we built. We've got the real estate and we plan to monetize it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great, thanks for taking my question. Burt, I've got one for you. Obviously, you didn't comment on fiscal '25. I believe at this point last year, you did give a couple of breadcrumbs on how to think about ARR. I'm curious as we as we sort of sharpen our pencils on '25, are there any guidepost or things that we should think about whether its growth or profitability?\nBurt Podbere: Hey, Matt. Great question. So for us, we are always looking to maximize our growth while at the same time paying attention to the bottom-line. So that's never changed. We are absolutely going to continue to invest in innovation. We got -- we announced so much at our last Fal.Con. We've got a lot of momentum. We're going to continue to invest to continue that momentum. But also at the same time, we recognize that we want to make sure that we're a very well-run company and people are seeing the output of that certainly on this quarter and we don't plan on changing that at all for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. George, it's impressive to really see the consistency of your team at scale here. But I'm just curious, how did traction continue into the end of the October quarter and then again into -- we're almost through November, relative to the October period. And the reason I'm asking this is that, we've generally heard of a fade in business activity through October across the industry, not necessarily with you, I mean, actually we didn't hear with you, but across most others. And it's actually sort of shown up in results of some of your security peers. So, I'm just wondering, maybe -- what are you seeing. What did you see into the end of the quarter? And what are you seeing at the beginning of the January period?\nGeorge Kurtz: Yeah, we certainly had a strong October. I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, the macro environment is still challenging. I mean, make no mistake about that. Deals take longer, a lot more scrutiny, a lot of sign offs, and there's a lot more work that goes into these larger enterprise deals. Getting deals done even like Falcon Flex, which are more enterprise-like in their nature, takes time. So, we had a great October, but in general, buyers are still cautious. And I think the fact that we're able to provide a real platform play that allows them to consolidate in other technologies and ultimately save money accrues values to us, but it certainly takes a lot of time and effort to get the deal over the goal line. But the team did a great job and October was strong for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. The first question is Bionic contribution, you said was de minimis. Can you define what de minimis for net new -- the contribution to net new ARR? And then, quarter was phenomenal, but I do see some weakness across the board of cyber companies with billings. In your case, it was down about 2%. I also see some weakness in deferred revenues. How do I reconcile what I see with billings, with deferred, with the underlying drivers that are very strong and your strong execution? Why is -- why are we seeing weakness not just with you, maybe with the entire space, but why are we seeing weakness with billings across the board? Thanks.\nBurt Podbere: Thanks, Tal. Good question. I'm going to start with billings. Yeah, you're correct. For us specifically, we don't manage the business to billings and we feel that ARR gives you the absolute best proxy to revenue and we felt that that's the right metric, as you know, since we went public, to give you more transparency into the health of our business. And that's the metric that really guides you on health. With respect to billings ourselves, I mean, we think about billings similar to probably most of you out there, is that billings, typically for hardware companies, use that when they don't disclose any sort of bookings metric, and that's not us, right. We think that billings has certain things that just are not as relevant as a metric like ARR. You're comparing a balance sheet item to a P&L item. For us, the P&L is going to dictate the health of the business. So for us, you know, billings obviously is going to be impacted by duration and there are many things that go into that. And remember also that when you think about on a year-on-year basis, we're still up on billings. And I think that's the one thing that you want to take away. For us, when we think about how we want to continue to be transparent, ARR really gives you that notion of where we're going and how we're doing. And I think that that's the focus. And it has been, by the way, since we went public, even as a private company, that's the one that we manage the business to, that's how we look at how to give out quotas to our reps, et cetera, et cetera. So for us, that's not going to change. And I hope that answers that question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just for George on CNAPP, it's obviously great to hear the traction. As we look ahead, should we still view this more of an upsell opportunity to existing customers or what needs to happen for this to be more of a tip of spear to drive net new logos? Thanks so much.\nMaria Riley: I'm sorry, would you mind repeating your question?\nAdam Borg: Great, can you hear me okay now?\nMaria Riley: Yeah, I can -- we can hear you now.\nAdam Borg: Great. Sorry about that. Maybe just on CNAPP, it's great to see the continued traction there. And as the market matures, should we view this as more of an upsell opportunity or what needs to happen for this to be more of a tip of spear to drive net new logos?\nGeorge Kurtz: Yeah, it's really a bright star for us when you look at our CNAPP capabilities of cloud workload protection, CSPM, CIEM, ASPM now with Bionic. We really have, I think one of the most complete cloud security offerings in the industry, and we're winning deals with it. We're leading, in many cases, particularly forward-leaning cloud companies that we're selling to. If you look at the latest threat environment and what's happening and how identities are being abused and two-factor authentication systems being bypassed, those sort of things, it's important to have a full suite of cloud protection. And I think this is sort of the awakening time for that industry and that companies can't just say, hey, we've got something from a cloud provider or we're going to go at it alone. I remember many, many, many years ago, companies didn't run antivirus, right? And you would say that's silly. Today, everybody runs an antivirus-type technology. It wasn't so silly 30, 35-plus years ago. And I think this is kind of the inflection point in the cloud world, where you're going to have multiple levels of protection, both agent and agentless. And the fact that we've been able to harmonize those two together and deliver a very robust agentless technology combined with the best cloud workload protection in the industry gives us a real advantage.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity.\nMichael Walkley: Great. Thanks. George, you touched on the new release of Falcon Go to better target SMB customers with more concise packaging. Can you just give us some color on how this segment of your business is trending, as some of your competitors have called out soft SMB spending due to the macro? And also, just how is this new release helping address pain points for these smaller customers? It seems like you're starting to accelerate win rates in this segment.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, we saw a very strong SMB segment. We've done a lot of work, A, starting with our partners like Pax8 and others, Dell, in that market. So meeting the customers, where they like to buy is really, really important. And then, coming up with a very innovative and easy-to-use technology designed for the SMB, our latest release of Falcon Go is literally one-click install. And the feedback that we've gotten from customers are like, \"Wow, this is the easiest thing I've seen. It just works.\" And I think you're going to see even more broad adoption because we've made it so easy to install. You don't have to be an IT professional. And then, we've got our partner network that are building services around it. So they're able to generate dollars. We're able to sell our product through their channels where they meet the customers. And I think we've taken a very innovative and effective approach in our partnering strategy. This is something that we've really worked on over the last year, 18 months, and we're bearing the fruit of it right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell of BTIG.\nGray Powell: Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. Yeah, I was just wondering if you could repeat the commentary on the potential for a year-end budget flush. I think you said that it was not going to be a typical year. And if I remember correctly, last year, the commentary is more like there's going to be little or no budget flush. So, I guess my question is like how does this year look in comparison? Is it better, same, worse? Just sort of what's your confidence level on trends?\nGeorge Kurtz: I think we're looking at it saying, it may not happen, right. So, we're not necessarily counting on that. And if it does happen, fantastic. And you have to again keep in mind that our fiscal year end is the beginning of a new budget cycle as well. So, we have year-end budget if it comes in December and then new budgets in January. But we -- the macro environment, I would say has remained steady. As I said earlier, it's still challenging and we'll see if a budget flush comes, but that's not something that we're counting on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the Charlotte AI revenue potential and maybe what customer use cases are seeing the most interest so far? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, we announced our pricing at Fal.Con. That was actually well received with customers. And in terms of the overall used cases, as I've talked about in the past, really it's helping a Tier 1 SOC analyst up level themselves to be a Tier 3, right? It's really driving SOC automation, which is a big focus for us with things like Charlotte and things like Falcon Foundry, how do you drive automation into organizations to give them better outcomes. At the end of the day, they would be willing to pay for something if it's going to save them time or money or make their job easier. And what we've seen in the customers who are using Charlotte right now in its preview mode is, they're able to do things way faster than they ever could and they're able to explore and ask questions that they haven't been able to do in the past, right? It just makes it so easy to have Charlotte gather up all the information and then take an action on their behalf. So, A, the pricing has resonated well with customers. We'll see how it shakes out as we get into full swing of things. But overall, what we've put together and the fact that it isn't an independent chatbot, it's really a foundational platform service that's wired into everything that we do and allows automation through all the modules, I think is a home run for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you for taking the question. George, in your prepared remarks, you expressed a lot of excitement for Falcon for IT. But in addition to better security, better unification with IT, it also strikes me as having the potential to be a real ROI-driven sale for many customers. Do you agree with that? And if so, is that going to be an angle that you really go after from a go-to-market standpoint?\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, it's exactly what we're hearing from customers. I was with a customer last night and they were saying, we're so excited for Falcon for IT, because we've got to work. We find the problems, we document them, and then we've got to work with the IT teams to get them fixed, and a lot of times their tooling is well behind what we can do with Falcon, and they sort of end up fixing it themselves with IT because we just have the capabilities to do that. So, to be able to carve out a home for IT and seamlessly help them understand their exposures on their assets that matter and then drive the automation to actually remediate those is incredible. And it goes beyond just kind of simple remediation. If you think about all the internal use cases in HR, an employee might have an issue, they might have to investigate it, they might have to do forensics on systems. Systems are remote all over the world. We've got many, many airlines that use our technology. They don't want to send out an IT person to go fix a kiosk that has a Microsoft blue screen. So what can they do? They can use Falcon for IT to bring it back to health. Tremendous savings in terms of cost and travel and complexity. So this one, I'm really, really excited about. And again, we're working to get all the components of what customers need, at least for this first release. And then, I think sort of the sky is the limit of what we can build out there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Good evening. Thank you. George and Burt, I have a question for you. As you think about your fiscal year '25 planning assumptions. You mentioned a couple of times that the macro environment is very consistent. Clearly, the execution on growth and profitability is very consistent. I'd love your observations on what's incrementally changing. Meaning, as you think about your priorities into next year, what's new versus this time last year? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, I'll start and then I'll let Burt jump in. I think from a priority perspective just on go-to-market and product-related. You talk about the fiscal piece, Burt. But we continue to drive innovation. Our focus has been on innovation, not integration. And I think that's shown in what we've been able to deliver in the market, how fast we've been able to come out with products. Falcon was our richest release of technology. So, we want to continue to be the innovation leader in security, and I think customers will recognize that. From a go-to-market perspective, there's a lot of work that we've done in terms of really, really making sure we've got the right hygiene across the enterprise and making sure that we can compress these, basically, time in sales cycles to get deals done when we need to and vector them in, and then also as we go down market into SMB, creating the right products for that segment and then delivering it through the right channels. So, what we have is working. So, it's going to continue to drive innovation, continue to remove friction in go-to-market motion, and continue operational excellence up and down the sales and the partner organization. Burt?\nBurt Podbere: Thanks, George. So, in terms of how we think about the macro next year, we're not going to predict the change in the macro until we actually see it, right? I think that's going to be the wait-and-see game for most companies and that's certainly the one that we're going to take, but that's how I see it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you so much. Thanks for a great print. But I was hoping you could give us some clarity around some of the key metrics that people use to track conditions, closure rates, whether they're stable, improving or eroding cycle time. I know you've said your deal size is up and I think at Fal.Con you talked about a significant increase in pipeline build. I think the comment was made on the stage that your pipeline target that they had tried to build was more than doubled the target. So, I was hoping you could talk about what the pipeline looks like as we go into this quarter and into the new year.\nGeorge Kurtz: Great. Well, when we look at the current macro environment, it is stable. But as I talked about in the Q&A and in the prepared remarks, it's still a challenging environment, it takes a lot of effort to get deals done. And again, it depends on the segments. Some segments are going to be a little bit longer in the enterprise and SMB a little bit shorter. But that being said, when we look out and we look at things like our pipeline, we have a record pipeline and we have that because I think we've got the best product suite in the industry. We've got customers that are truly understanding the platform capabilities of what we've built. They're coming to us and saying, \"Hey, let's sit down and go through your roadmap and our roadmap and let's figure out what we can consolidate.\" So, they're coming to us with the openness of wanting to buy more and leveraging things like Falcon Flex to be able to have bigger commits at CrowdStrike, which is important. And overall, it's, as I said, still a tough environment. But I think we've got some key metrics like the pipeline that is encouraging to us. And when you look at LogScale and our cloud business and our identity business, I mean, these are absolutely bright stars across the entire platform. And again, keep in mind, we're not selling individual piece parts. People are buying the platform and that's what's driving the growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEric Heath: Great. Thanks for fitting me in here. George, I guess I'll come back to the SIEM conversation. So, appreciate the color on the synergies of using LogScale to do the analytics on top of your first-party data that you're already capturing, makes a ton of sense. But I guess, can you flush out a bit more as to why your AI engine and your proprietary endpoint data is a better approach to capture the next-gen SIEM opportunity that many seem to be targeting, including those that claim to have more first-party data sources?\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, when you look at just kind of the data gravity and what customers care about, from a security perspective, I would say 85% of really the value of the data and the data that's generated comes from the endpoint. That really is the richest source of data because that's where it's generated from. As it goes across the network, it gets down-selected and you lose a lot of the fidelity. So, we already have a lot of that data. So let's start there. Then, when you look at LogScale, LogScale is very robust. It has the capabilities to ingest just about any type of third-party data into the product and very effectively without creating an index, which is its unique capabilities, index-free ingestion, which means you get immediate results. So, from a platform perspective, we sort of have the data gravity already. We've got that 85% of the data. So customers would rather give us 15% that we don't have and leverage LogScale to replace their SIEM. And beyond replacing their SIEM, that's the security use case, we have customers -- many, many customers that use it for all kinds of performance management, logging their infrastructure, logging their Kubernetes clusters. So, when you combine the fact that we're coming out with Falcon for IT, now with LogScale, which can log any data above and beyond security, we think that's a much broader opportunity than just SIEM itself. It opens up the entire data architecture of an organization to CrowdStrike.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to George Kurtz for closing remarks. Sir?\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, thank you. And I first want to close by acknowledging the heroic dedication of our team in Israel, who continue to remain focused on CrowdStrike's mission. Our thoughts are with each and every one of you in these trying times of war. Thanks all of you for your time today. We appreciate your interest and look forward to seeing you at our upcoming investor event and happy holidays.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurtz: Thank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter, we exceeded our guidance across both top and bottom-line metrics, delivering strong, durable growth at scale and credible leverage and operating within our target model on every metric. Even with a challenging macro backdrop, we delivered an impressive quarter, highlighting CrowdStrike's structural competitive moat, making Falcon the definitive cybersecurity platform for the cloud era. Financial highlights for the quarter include, ending ARR of $2.9 billion, up 37% year-over-year, with record contribution from cloud security, identity protection and LogScale Next-gen SIEM, together surpassing $500 million in ARR, record non-GAAP operating margin of 21.3%, record non-GAAP net income, which grew 109% year-over-year, GAAP profitability for the second consecutive quarter, record Q2 free cash flow of $188.7 million and an over 80% year-over-year increase in deals involving eight or more Falcon platform modules. Our commitment to operational excellence and the utilization of AI within our platform and across our entire organization is driving enviable leverage in our financial results, even as we aggressively invest in fueling growth. As Burt will discuss, we are raising our revenue outlook for the year and bringing in our timeline to sustainably achieve our non-GAAP target operating model. We now expect to exit Q4 within our target non-GAAP operating margin model and to remain within our target model on an annual basis starting in FY '25. In an increasingly digital cloud-defined world, cybersecurity is becoming more important than ever. The SEC's recently enacted cybersecurity disclosure requirements substantiate the growing gravity of cybersecurity threats, elevating the category from an operational concern to an urgent Board level and CXO spend priority. At CrowdStrike, we continue to build cybersecurityâ€™s platform of choice, offering a simple and powerful promise. We stop breaches. Heading into the second half of the year, we see increased momentum in the business, driven by record levels of new logo and upsell pipeline, record deal registrations from our market-leading partner ecosystem and record levels of customers proudly trusting CrowdStrike to be their long-term security platform consolidator of choice. We are also observing substantial changes in the competitive landscape, uniquely benefiting CrowdStrike. With the business momentum we see and competitive market dynamics, we believe our second half performance will yield double-digit net new ARR growth. Working in cybersecurity for the past 30 years, I have recognized and created tectonic shifts in this industry and we are in the midst of one right now. Organizations need better, faster and more cost-effective protection for a digital society. Organizations need seamless, not stitched together automation to break down legacy data silos. Organizations need lower TCO and more efficient ROI-driven investment. The competitive battlefield of cybersecurity today reflects these realities, separating the wheat from the chaff. Those who have platforms versus those with point products masquerading as platform stories. What was a market littered with dozens of companies is quickly consolidating to several vendors. Smaller, narrower point product companies are being left behind. These companies are quickly going the way of legacy AV, already in the hands or looking for the safe hands of strategic or private equity buyers. Point products, single feature cloud security companies are learning the hard way that platforms built by design win at scale. Today's competitive landscape solidifies CrowdStrike's leadership position and turns what were once competitors into immediate shared donors. CrowdStrike is purpose-built for this market. We have the technology innovation, mission-driven team and sizable scale to lead cybersecurity platform consolidation. Shifting from competitive market dynamics to CrowdStrike, here are the reasons I see us winning in the second half and beyond. The Falcon platform enables real consolidation with best-of-breed outcomes, and we are flighting XDR transformations across cloud security, identity protection and LogScale Next-gen SIEM. Each of these three platform solutions are high-growth, sizable businesses. Each are examples of IPO worthy companies in their own right and each are seamlessly integrated components of the Falcon platform. Let me first provide commentary on CrowdStrike as cybersecurities consolidator, and then I'll follow up with updates on our cloud, identity and Next-gen SIEM Falcon platform businesses. The Falcon platform has not only become the standard for delivering AI-powered cybersecurity, it has become the foundational cybersecurity platform for our customers. Our revolutionary cloud-native architecture consists of an AI-powered data platform and lightweight sensor form factor, which remains the easiest and fastest to deploy with no reboots. Our form factor was made for the digital anywhere enterprise, not bound by operating system or hardware-defined network perimeters. CrowdStrike has the visibility to detect and prevent attacks and the workflow integrations and automation to remediate. We have the prime enterprise real estate on devices and multi-cloud workloads to automate and consolidate cybersecurity. Customer after customer I met with at the Black Hat Security Conference wants to anchor their cybersecurity on the Falcon platform. These customers see us as their core partner in their security journey. With consolidation being a hot topic, let's talk about what security outcomes really mean. Stopping the breach. This is the most important outcome. Companies need vendors who are trusted partners that can understand, prevent and respond to threat actors to stop breaches. CrowdStrike is uniquely positioned to stop breaches with our technology, threat intelligence and services. Saving time, delivering everything in a single modern console coupled with generative AI reduces dwell time and makes cybersecurity faster and easier. Saving money with most enterprises still buying north of 60 cybersecurity point products, there's too much cybersecurity shelf wear. Individual products require learning and maintenance, building integrations and higher staffing costs. Eliminating the time managing, integrating, updating and operating superfluous tools represents real savings regarding product, people, process and cost. And finally, doing more. CrowdStrike's Falcon unlocks new capabilities for organizations such as deploying their first code to cloud security, identity protection, exposure management, attack surface reduction, next-gen SIEM and more, all in one integrated platform. The breadth of native Falcon capabilities in our prime real estate within the enterprise and SMB technology stack is our advantage and creates significant customer expansion path. Our open XDR platform, the ability to take in first-party and third-party data is quickly becoming the enterprise data destination. We see data gravity for the management of cybersecurity, but also broader observability use cases as a competitive moat for CrowdStrike. Customers gain greater value with every module they adopt, reducing agents, security gaps, complexity and cost, enabling them to transform and consolidate their security stack with the Falcon platform. Let me share several recent new customer wins that speak to this. First is a major auto manufacturer that tried but failed to consolidate their security on Microsoft E5. This company's security team quickly realized Microsoft's complexity, multiple consoles, lack of integration, miss detections and complex deployments hampered their ability to defend themselves and consolidate. This customer is now consolidating on the Falcon platform with Falcon Complete for Endpoint, Identity and Cloud. Now with a single agent, single user interface and single platform, they have complete visibility across their end points, cloud and identities and the ability to stop threats in real time. By moving from expensive Microsoft E5 to CrowdStrike, organizations can save 50% plus per user per year on Microsoft licensing costs, adding up to millions of dollars of savings. Another seven-figure consolidation win was with a leading residential construction manufacturer who took their Falcon Complete subscription to the next level. Beyond the Endpoint, this customer purchased Falcon Cloud Security, Identity Protection, LogScale and Falcon Surface, our external attack surface management offering. Falcon has become the platform of consolidation and trust for this enterprise, reducing spend with three other vendors by more than 60% and wholly eliminating multiple vendors from their stack. Consolidation is not only fueling bigger new logo lands but also increased platform adoption, especially in the areas of cloud security, identity protection and LogScale, which, in aggregate, contribute well over $0.5 billion in ending ARR. Financial services, technology, retail and manufacturing industry verticals continue to demonstrate strong demand with large deal sizes. In Q2, we closed over 80% more deals involving eight or more modules than a year ago as customers increasingly look to CrowdStrike to consolidate their security stack. Let me now discuss our momentum in the platform areas of Cloud, Identity and LogScale, Next-gen SIEM, where we are setting new records. Let's start with Cloud Security, where net new ARR growth accelerated meaningfully and reached a new record during the quarter. Ending ARR for Falcon modules deployed in a public cloud grew to $296 million, up 70% year-over-year, larger than almost every single vendor in cloud security today. Driving this inflection is our focused innovation on Falcon Cloud Security, our CNAPP suite offering, which unifies agent and agentless cloud-native security capabilities into a single offering, providing immediate time to value across all major cloud environments. Net new ARR growth for Falcon Cloud Security accelerated to 70% quarter-over-quarter. We have made it easier for customers to consume Falcon Cloud Security with a single SKU and customers are rapidly standardizing on CrowdStrike as their cloud security platform of choice. Customers are eager to move away from multiple point product vendors to Falcon's unified best-of-breed platform. We added many new capabilities to our CNAPP offering, including infrastructure as code, site scanning and attack path analysis, creating the most comprehensive CNAPP solution on the market. Combined with Falcon Surface, our external attack surface monitoring solution that we acquired last year, we now provide a complete outside-in and inside-out view of a customer's security posture. This past quarter, we executed a go-to-market emphasis on cloud security, hosting a virtual Cloud Security Summit with over 12,500 security and DevOp participants followed by cloud-focused partner and sales plays. Our integrated cloud suite, easy management and lower TCO value propositions are resonating at scale. We closed a record number of cloud customer wins in Q2, including multiple seven-figure cloud expansions with Fortune 500 customers, together in excess of $20 million in deal value. An iconic Fortune 50 retailer prioritized a full, not phased, Falcon Cloud Security purchase of $5 million in deal value, choosing CrowdStrike over a point product cloud security scanner and displacing their firewall vendor. Additionally, a major Fortune 500 manufacturer sought product superiority and a single-platform approach replacing Wiz with Falcon Cloud Security. Other cloud wins include [new wins] (ph), with financial, technology media and healthcare companies as well as public sector accounts. Finally, I want to highlight a cloud expansion with a Fortune 1000 retail brand facing increasing costs from their incumbent cloud security vendor and struggling with limited visibility over their cloud assets. This customer launched an initiative to unify their security stack and remove gaps between traditional endpoint, cloud runtime security and posture management. CrowdStrike is the only vendor that met these requirements and a unified platform and helped them drive down their overall operational costs. The cloud security market opportunity is massive and growing rapidly with the potential to reach $18 billion in calendar year 2026. Cloud exploitation by adversaries increased 95% year-over-year and the only way to stop threats at all time is with a fully-fledged agent and agentless cloud suite like Falcon. Only CrowdStrike delivers a fully integrated CNAPP solution that unifies cloud workload protection, cloud security posture management, cloud infrastructure entitlement management, threat intelligence and threat hunting in one platform across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Our leadership in cloud security was recognized in Frost & Sullivan's recently published 2023 Frost Radar, Cloud Workload Protection Platform report based on our impressive CWPP business growth, our comprehensive cloud visibility and our unrivaled cloud detection and response services. Identity Protection also stands out with over $200 million in ending ARR, up 194% year-over-year. Identity-based attacks represented 62% of all interactive intrusions we observed in the last 12 months. CrowdStrike's Falcon Identity Protection delivers the best protection against identity attacks, recently winning the CRN Tech Innovator Award as the best solution on the market. The identity protection adoption rate for new customers grew more than 100% year-over-year and the total number of deals tied to identity increased 200%. Highlighting this in Q2 is a financial services firm that initially turned to CrowdStrike for incident response following a breach where an attacker used legitimate credentials to bypass the company's existing security products and remain undetected for a week. Following remediation by CrowdStrike incident responders, this customer consolidated on the Falcon platform, adopting Falcon Complete, Falcon Identity Complete and Falcon Cloud Security Complete, displacing and consolidating four vendors in the process, Microsoft, SentinelOne, Arctic Wolf and Sophos. Moving to LogScale. Net new ARR from LogScale Next-gen SIEM reached a new record as customers increasingly adopt a solution to sell multiple use cases. The number of customers using LogScale grew more than 3x year-over-year. LogScale ending ARR grew over 200% year-over-year and is quickly approaching the $100 million ARR milestone, which we expect to achieve in Q3. A Fortune 500 manufacturing company expanded on the Falcon platform with a nearly $4 million deal value LogScale purchase after becoming frustrated with their legacy SIEM vendor due to its increasingly prohibitive costs, complex licensing and poor forced on-prem to cloud migration experience. Given LogScale's unparalleled speed and flexibility and cost-effective licensing model, this customer is now leveraging the Falcon platform to transition away from legacy SIM, supercharging the speed of both their observability and security use cases. Falcon is a platform that brings the benefits of generative AI to life for every SOC, CISO, CXO and enterprise. We do it with proprietary threat data, and we do it with industry-leading AI expertise. Charlotte AI is the engine powering our portfolio of generative AI capabilities across the platform, utilizing CrowdStrike's high-fidelity data advantage. Charlotte AI helps Falcon users of all skill levels to do more in the platform by automating workflows, which fuels module adoption and reduces the mean time to detect and respond. The net benefit to customers from our pioneering use of AI in a single platform is faster results, better security outcomes and lower overall cost, ushering in a new era of machine speed security. We showcased Charlotte AI earlier this month at Black Hat where we're the only vendor of consequence to showcase a live, not PowerPoint, demo of generative AI in action. Public reception was fantastic, and we will release Charlotte AI pricing at Falcon. Moving to partners. 64% of new customers from large enterprises to SMBs were sourced from our partners in the quarter. Our industry-leading partner ecosystem is embracing the broader Falcon platform, building long-term differentiated businesses with CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is AWS' largest cybersecurity go-to-market partner. And we recently won their ISV Partner of the Year Award, validating our cloud security category leadership, commitment to innovation and go-to-market success, particularly in cloud security. Finally, the initial momentum we are building through our partnership with Dell is exciting, delivering eight figures in deal value in just a few months. As we highlighted previously, our resell agreement with Dell hit the market in Q1 delivering in-quarter new deals in every major geography region. In the second quarter, we went live with attached device sales globally and rapidly achieved industry-leading device attach rates. Demand in our markets has remained resilient. And even as we continue to operate at a time of macro uncertainty and increased deal scrutiny, our win rates remain high. The momentum we are building with consolidation deals specifically tied to Cloud Security, Identity Protection, Next-gen SIEM and increased partner engagement is driving our pipeline to record levels. Additionally, Fal.Con, our annual customer conference, is our biggest selling event of the year, and this year, registration is already up 80% from last year. The Falcon ecosystem will be on full display with over 70 technology go-to-market partner sponsors in attendance. I would like to invite our investors and analysts to join us at Fal.Com. Similar to last year, in conjunction with the event, we will hold an investor briefing featuring conversations with customers and partners. This year's briefing will also include a financial discussion led by our CFO, Burt Podbere. Please note that customer sessions will not be available on the webcast, so please join us in person. And with that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results.\nBurt Podbere: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. We delivered a strong second quarter amid a continued challenging macro environment. In Q2, we scaled the business to new heights and drove significant operating leverage. New milestones in the quarter included record operating margin, which was within our target operating model for the first time in company history, record non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike, which more than doubled year-over-year, and GAAP profitability for the second quarter in a row. The demand environment remained resilient, and we built record levels of new logo and upsell pipeline. We achieved Q2 net new ARR of $196.2 million, which was above stated assumptions as our relentless focus on sales execution enabled us to perform well even as we continue to see heightened deal scrutiny and elongated sales cycles. We ended the quarter with ending ARR reaching $2.93 billion, up 37% over last year. We continue to be very pleased with the success of our land-and-expand strategy with our dollar-based net retention rate effectively at our benchmark in Q2. Subscription customers with five or more, six or more and seven or more modules increased to 63%, 41% and 24% of subscription customers, respectively. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 37% over Q2 of last year to reach $731.6 million. Subscription revenue grew 36% over Q2 of last year to reach $690.0 million. Professional services revenue was $41.7 million, setting a new record for the 12th consecutive quarter and representing 44% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, we also saw strength in Latin America, the Middle East and Japan. International revenue grew 43% year-over-year. Our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin performance remained strong. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 78%, and we achieved subscription gross margin of approximately 80% for the second consecutive quarter. We look forward to discussing the initiatives and investments we are making to drive subscription gross margin higher and beyond our target model in more detail at our Fal.Con Investor Briefing in September. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were $412.5 million or 56% of revenue versus $321.4 million last year or 60% of revenue. Q2 sales and marketing and R&D expenses grew 26% and 35% year-over-year, respectively. We expect sales and marketing and R&D expenses to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of in-person events, marketing and technology development programs. As a result of our dedication to operational excellence and profitable growth at scale, in Q2, we achieved multiple new milestones for the profitability of the business. These milestones included record non-GAAP operating income of $155.7 million, growing 78% year-over-year, achieving our target model range for non-GAAP operating margin for the first time in company history and a record 21% of revenue, well ahead of our planned timeline. More than doubling non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike, which grew to a record $180.0 million or $0.74 on a diluted per share basis. And finally, achieving GAAP profitability for the second consecutive quarter. These achievements speak to the power of our financial model and focus on running an efficient business. We are accelerating our timeline to reach the target model. As implied in our guidance, we now expect to exit Q4 within our target non-GAAP operating margin model and to remain within our target model on an annual basis starting in FY '25. We ended the second quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.17 billion. Cash flow from operations grew 17% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $244.8 million. Free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $188.7 million or 26% of revenue, achieving a rule of 63 on a free cash flow basis. Looking at the first half of fiscal year 2024, free cash flow grew 42% year-over-year to reach $416.1 million and 29% of revenue, putting us well on track to reach our stated goal of 30% free cash flow margin for the full fiscal year. Moving to our outlook. We are raising our revenue guidance for the fiscal year and maintaining our net new ARR assumptions for the second half and fiscal year, which call for in line to modestly up net new ARR for the full year. For the third quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $775.4 million to $778.0 million reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 33% to 34%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $154.4 million to $156.3 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $179.8 million to $181.8 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.74, utilizing a weighted average share count of 244 million shares on a diluted basis. We are raising our revenue and profitability guidance for the full fiscal year 2024. We currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,030.7 million to $3,042.9 million, reflecting a growth rate of 35% to 36% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $601.3 million and $610.5 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $680.4 million and $689.7 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.84. George and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, George. Hey, Burt. Thanks for taking my question here.\nBurt Podbere: Great to hear your voice, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: Same here, Burt, and great to see the profitability, so much fun stuff to talk about in the quarter. But maybe I'll just hit 1 topic head on, which is the scrutiny that I think all of us have on the second half net new ARR ramp. And listen, I think we've heard it from you and George for multiple quarters now that the multiproduct pipeline just looks strong. But I was wondering if either of you could help us maybe look at that ramp from another lens to maybe help us get a little bit more confidence, whether that's based on things like net revenue retention or implied new logo business, any other lens that you'd have us look at -- I guess, look through when kind of stress testing that second half net new ARR ramp that you're guiding to?\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure, Saket. Let me take the first part, and I will turn it over to Burt. So when we think about the back half of the year and our confidence, I think it starts with the product and the consolidation that we're seeing. Customer after customer looking to consolidate on the platform and the product portfolio has never been stronger, particularly in the areas that I talked about, Cloud, LogScale, Identity. We gave you some great numbers around that. Then you look to our partners, our industry-leading partners in our ecosystem. We continue to grow that. We've got tremendous focus on that internally with a new leader, Dell, Pax8. I mean I can go down the list of our partners and certainly AWS that I called out, all contributing to our momentum. And then the pipeline, a record pipeline as we see this. The partners and CrowdStrike are delivering a record pipeline because the products are there. So that's the way I look at it. Burt?\nBurt Podbere: Yes. I would just add a couple of things. One, I would add, we're very happy with our retention rates. We think they're best in class, as well as I think we're seeing strength from multiple aspects of the business, right, from either our enterprise or SMBs. We see strength in both. So that's why we get confidence in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with MoffettNathanson.\nSterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I also want to drill in on that same topic, but specific, George, to one of the comments made about the sales pipeline. And wondering if you can just peel back the onion and talk about what you saw in this quarter and what is happening with the strength and maturity in the pipeline coverage, specifically to drive that acceleration?\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. I think you have to start with the ramp reps that we have. We did a lot of hiring last year. It takes a while to ramp rep. So we're going into the back half of the year with ramp capacity, which we're obviously excited about. And then a lot of it has to do with me being in the field and talking to customers and just what I'm hearing from them. I was recently on a call with a large Fortune 200 company. I was on with their CIO, their CTO and their CSO. And they said the reason we have all of these people together is because of the spend, which is eight figures, and two, we were so strategic. We're actually handling their observability and their security use cases. So when I look at that and I look at the product portfolio and where we are, it's just encouraging, combined with the sales ramp and the capacity we have as we go to the back half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter and Iâ€™d echo Saket's comments about profitability, that is really an amazing outlook. I wanted to just ask another question on the back half of the year guidance. The way you described everything, George, with products, consolidation, partners growing, record pipeline, ramped reps, I know the back half does look fairly aggressive, but you also have easy comps, too. So maybe why not -- what gives you caution about raising that guidance a little bit more coming off of a really good quarter and heading into with all those positive trends you have going for your business right now?\nBurt Podbere: Hey, Andy, it's Burt. So when it comes to guidance, we take a very prudent approach. And we guide to basically what we see, not what we don't see. We definitely don't guide to running tables. And you've also got to still factor in that, it's still -- we're still in a tough macro. We do see deals getting elongated and sales cycles taking longer. So I think those are the things why we guided to the way we guided.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ethan on for Rob here. George, I just wanted to touch on that observability point that just came up again. And highlighted the success you're seeing with LogScale. So can you talk a little bit more about some of those observability use cases that you're seeing success with and maybe where you're seeing a little bit of differentiation? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. So when you look at LogScale, its capabilities are obviously Next-gen SIEM, but also in observability, and we have many customers that use it just for that use case, and we have an opportunity to go back and sell them security. Things like managing and monitoring the Kubernetes clusters, the cloud environment, their infrastructure, I mean we have a customer who manages like the train schedules on it. So it can manage a large set of data, and it does it extremely efficiently. And what we're seeing right now is customers telling other customers about it. We have huge Fortune 25 referenceable customers in the space. And I think the success begets more success in that area. So that's why we're pretty excited about it. And you've seen the growth in that area and customers are looking for something that's better and faster and gives them an outcome that is more contemporary than what they're using today.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, many thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the $500 million ARR run rate that you mentioned for LogScale and others. And, A, is that the same composition from the analyst event where you referenced it was $399 million in the January quarter. So it's up 25% in only two quarters, so pretty healthy growth there? B, any comments on how you anticipate that continuing to scale over the next couple of quarters to help realize that back half of your guidance? C, any update on the thoughts on M&A that might contribute to the growth of that emerging portfolio? Thanks very much?\nBurt Podbere: Yeah, it's a great question. So for us, the way we broke it out on this earnings call, it's not the emerging category that we had talked about in the past. It's different. And we wanted to give increased visibility into the specific business lines. And we thought that it would be very important for everybody to see how well they're performing and how well [indiscernible] scale they're performing. So you've got, obviously, our Cloud momentum. You've got our LogScale momentum and our Identity momentum. And we wanted to show everybody exactly how we're doing in those areas, and that they're taking flight at scale. I'll pass the other questions over to George.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, when we think about the current environment, I think everyone is seeing there is a shift in the competitive environment and companies that are moving around in terms of M&A activity. We think the back half of the year will be a great opportunity. We continue to evaluate many, many different candidates as we normally do. And we think the environment is getting better from an M&A perspective. And we're very diligent in how we buy things in the bar and how we look to integration because we focus on a seamless one platform approach, and we remain true to that. So back half of the year, we'll see how it goes, but certainly excited about that, and we continue to drive innovation internally and we'll look externally for good companies with good culture and good people.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.\nMike Walkley: Great. Thank you. George, it's clear platform leaders are gaining wallet share as enterprises consolidate vendors. I just want to dig in a little bit more. It seems like there's even a big shift more favorable to CrowdStrike from your comments even a quarter ago, with SentinelOne and BlackBerry Cylance potentially up for sale, are you already generating strong share gain opportunities in the SMB market? Or can you just let us know how Falcon Go is trending versus your expectations?\nGeorge Kurtz: Yeah. We already see that in the marketplace. We've got customers that are very concerned about the uncertainty. They have seen the Cylance Blackberry movie before, and they're concerned and uncertainty is never a good thing for a security buyer. So we've already seen deals come our way. And again, as a consolidator, and as the leader of the space, we think that just accrues more value to us. So we'll see how everything shakes out, but for sure, what we're hearing from partners and customers about some of the latest movements in our space is concern in terms of other competitors. And again, they're looking for a long-term viable partner, and those are -- that's what we're hearing from multiple sources.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the good results. So maybe one on the competitive side. I guess the biggest concern we've heard from investors is just on pricing in the endpoint security space, particularly as EDR adoption moves past the 50% mark. So I guess the question would be, how much room is left in the Global 2000? And then how sensitive do you think the incremental buyer is today compared to what you've seen the last two years? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, from buyers, what we've seen is their buying platform. They're not just buying one particular area. The way our technology works, it's single-agent architecture, a common data store and then modules and then we've been able to obviously monetize that across different areas. Protection is just one area. But when you look at cloud, you look at agentless, you look at some of the other offerings, LogScale and Identity, it's really about the platform sale, not an individual area and getting the right outcome, as I talked about in the earnings script, stopping breaches. I talked to a customer recently. They have 60 different products and controls. And we were the only one that actually detected activity in their environment and prevented a potential issue. So that's really been the focus for us. And I think when you look at even the legacy areas, it's almost, what, 50% of the market is still available from a legacy perspective, near 50%. So yeah, 48%. I think when you look at that, still a big opportunity in legacy displacements as well as the platform areas that we called out are just massive TAM opportunities. And as I mentioned in the script, they could each be an IPO-able business on a stand-alone basis as big as they are.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just for Burt. I wanted to understand how you're balancing spending both on a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective. It looks like operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis actually declined sequentially, but stock-based comps spiked up. Would love to know how the hiring environment is playing into that and how you think about managing that going forward? And any impact that might have toward achieving your cash flow targets? Thank you.\nBurt Podbere: Sure, right. So thanks for the question. So number one, we are going to continue to invest as aggressively as we can while keeping to our commitment to our profitability metrics. And for us, I think that the key here, you had mentioned on the stock-based compensation, a lot of that is based on timing of grants and I think that for us, we're going to continue to use grants to attract and retain. Having said that, we think that we are going to continue to show low dilution, less than 2% this year and strive to keep it under 3% for next year. For us today, we think it's a good hiring environment. We're taking the time in terms of how we're going to [Technical Difficulty] hiring and where, and we're being very prudent in terms of where we're deploying headcount. And as we've mentioned in prior calls, we are managing the pace of hiring in accordance with what we think is what we need to continue to hit our targets. So that's how we see it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the strong results. Can you maybe give us some additional color in terms of what you're seeing for these attach rates, especially with the eight or more products and how do we think about maybe net retention going forward as you start to realize that platform vision? Thank you.\nBurt Podbere: Yeah, Jonathan, great to hear your voice. Yeah. We're really pleased with what we've seen with respect to customers adopting across the board, five, six, seven, eight modules. So for us, when you talk about the DBNR, remember, it's a noisy metric, and it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and we've talked about that repeatedly. Some quarters have bigger [lands] (ph) and some have bigger expense. But I think at the end of the day, for us, what we're seeing is that we've got a lot of headroom in both new local opportunities. George talked about the available market from our legacy provider 48%, but we also have an ever-growing customer base. And as we continue to delight our customers, they're going to continue to buy more for us, and it goes along with the consolidation theme that we've been talking about here. So it really plays into our favor. The great news is that in addition to strong expansions, net new ARR contribution from new logos remains high, even higher than we were expecting so far for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you for taking the question. George, obviously, it's extremely early as it remains -- as it relates rather to the arc of generative AI. But you did mention in your prepared remarks that you plan to release Charlotte AI pricing at Fal.Con. Presumably, that means there will be some form of discrete monetization for Charlotte. We haven't really seen that though from other cybersecurity vendors as yet. So when it comes to your data and the application of your AI tech, maybe just help us understand kind of why you think you'll be able to not just deliver incremental value to your customers but monetize it as well? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. Well, when you look at outcomes, as I mentioned, one of them is doing more with less. And in security, there's upwards of probably a 3 million person gap and the ability to actually hire security folks. And as I mentioned, when we launched Charlotte AI in public preview is the fact that it really -- it really is a virtual analyst, a SOC analyst, which are super expensive and hard to maintain. So for our purposes, when we look at the total value to a customer, if we can create more virtual analysts, just as an example that takes eight hours of work and compress it into 10 minutes. We think there's real value to that, which is why we'll have pricing around it, which we're going to deliver at Fal.Con. And even from what we've shown recently in one of the security conferences, it's real. It's out there. People liked it. They want it and it's differentiated from others that were just showing PowerPoint. So we're really excited about it. Obviously, it's early innings. But if we can show real value in creating these virtual analysts around Charlotte AI, we think customers are going to pay for that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Burt, I'm looking to better understand the impact that macro may be having on the upsell and downsell component of NRR. Are you seeing customers coming up for newer contracts, trying to optimize the number of endpoints they have and the number of employees that they have? Is that causing pressure on NRR? And if it is, when do you think that headwind might abate?\nBurt Podbere: Hey, Gabriela. So first, I think we talked about why we were giving guidance the way we did. We did talk about the 10% headwinds for the first half, we came in better than that. We talked about coming in flat to slightly up for the second half over last year. And I think at the end of the day, we're still in a tough macro. We believe all the things that George talked about, we're very adamant that we feel that we're going to be able to achieve those things. Having said that, you have to remember that still, as I said earlier on this call, deals are taking longer to close, there's more scrutiny on the P&Ls and so we have to overcome those things to be able to really overcome what -- anything that we would put out there. And for us, I think that we have a great opportunity to do so. And it's so long as we continue to stay the course, invest where we need to invest, take a prudent approach, I think we're going to be in good shape.\nGabriela Borges: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank.\nPatrick Colville: Hey, thank you for taking my question. And this one is for Burt. I mean you gave us lots of juicy metrics. And I guess I just want to get some clarifications. Can you give us the emerging products number, so we can kind of triage what we had previously versus kind of what you're giving us now? And then I guess the second part of my question is in reference to your comments about fiscal '25 operating margin being in line with the target model. Can you just remind us what the target model is that you're referencing?\nBurt Podbere: Yeah. So first, on the emerging products, we thought it would be better to give you full numbers on our businesses that are meaningful, that are taking flight. So we won't be going back to anything that we used to call emerging products. With respect to our target model for FY '25 and hitting those targets, the last one that we were talking about was certainly the operating margin. We said we were going to be between the 20% and 22% plus, and we actually hit that one. That was the last one of several that we gave out from subscription gross margin to F&M to G&A to R&D. We also gave out free cash. And for the year, we're still talking about that 30% to 32% plus.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. And our next question comes from the line of Yi Fu Lee with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYi Fu Lee: Congrats on the strong set of results. This is Yi in for Jonathan Ruykhaver. Just one question around CNAPP. Obviously, CrowdStrike is building CNAPP around endpoint. I was wondering if maybe, George, you could share any benefits of doing this versus other vendors that building it off, like, let's say, a Zero Trust Exchange? That is from us.\nGeorge Kurtz: Yeah. So when we think about our Cloud business, and I went into some detail on this. It's both agent and agentless so, right? It's not just around the cloud workload protection, but it's also around the cloud security posture management and everything really from code to cloud. And we've added tremendous capabilities, which I've called out in the earnings script as well in terms of our ability to instrument and flight containers and understand if insecure code is being put into the CICD pipeline, et cetera. So we've always been strong in the agent world. And what we're finding is that customers are looking at agentless and moving to our solution because it combines the best of both worlds, agent and agentless, together in one single SKU. And we had tremendous success last quarter. We've got a dedicated sales team on cloud, and customers are seeing the benefits of an integrated platform with Falcon. So we'll continue down that path. And again, we continue to build out its capabilities and win new business there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh with JMP Securities.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks for taking my question. George, maybe just to follow up on that last response around CNAPP. What's the appetite for customers to or at least start to look at combining CNAPP capabilities with XDR or at least kind of bridging the two together as far as kind of all the -- just another point of telemetry from cloud kind of feeding into that XDR outlook? And where do you see it either happening -- what's the kind of current state and where do you see it going? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, the current state is the reality, which is that's what we're doing today. So we're taking all that rich telemetry from the CNAPP offering, agent, agentless and even the exposure management that all from an XDR perspective, is coming back into the Falcon platform and is available to any of the algorithms to identify and prevent any sort of malicious activity. It's also available from a compliance perspective to help customers manage their compliance and risk. It's available from an asset graph perspective, which gives customers an idea of what's actually in their environment. And then from a cloud detection response perspective, we actually have some of our managed services that are able to help cloud customers, which at this point, is sort of an epidemic of issues in cloud environments, the way the adversaries are operating. So we're really pioneering that space and putting it all together. And there is a reason why we're one of the largest cloud security by revenue vendors in the market today.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Levine with Evercore ISI.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. George, maybe just to piggyback off of that other AI question. Every vendor is telling us their AI is proprietary. The outcomes are proprietary to their data. So maybe explain to us like really where the competitive moat comes from? When we hear Microsoft talk about or at least push all their products, their customers going copilot, Palo, Zscaler are all talking about kind of the same outcomes. But maybe put a finer point on why you think what your moat is around Charlotte AI?\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. It really is a good question, and I certainly agree with you. There's a lot of people talking about it, and I think we're actually delivering it. One of the things that I would point you to is the data set itself. And what's important to realize it isn't just about the most data. You'll hear that from a lot of vendors. One vendor will say more data than the other. It's really about sort of the curated data set because when we think about generative AI, it actually has to be trained. We think about ChatGPT, there's a bunch of humans helping to train it. Just so happens, probably more by luck than understanding generative AI was going to be on the horizon, that when we started the company, we actually have a very well-defined training set that's annotated based upon all the threat hunting that we've done over the last 10 years. So we believe our 10-year head start in terms of having a data set that's actually curated is going to give us a distinct advantage of helping our customers. So that's a big area. And then it's a foundational platform component, which is made available to every other service on the platform, which is different than others. So again, first innings, we'll see how it all unfolds, but initial customer reaction has been very, very positive.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now hand the call back over to CEO, George Kurtz for any closing remarks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Great. Well, I want to thank everyone for their time today. We certainly appreciate your interest and look forward to seeing you in person at our upcoming Fal.Con conference. Thanks so much, and we'll talk soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that todayâ€™s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Maria Riley, Vice-President of Investor Relations.\nMaria Riley: Good afternoon and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike, and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, and expected performance, including our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

I would like to note that we are conducting today's call from one of our European offices and ask for your patience in any event of technical difficulties. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurtz: Thank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. Our continued execution despite a challenging macro-environment translated to strong growth and exceptional margins, which drove record non-GAAP profitability, record free cash flow, and GAAP profitability for the first time in company history. We exceeded our guidance across both top and bottom-line metrics, increased gross margin, cost discipline, and moderated headcount growth contributed to our strong bottom-line results. Reaching GAAP profitability so early in our life as a public company provides insight into the strength of the model we have built and what we can achieve over time. Burt will cover the financial results in more detail. I will focus my comments on why we believe CrowdStrike has a clear and sustainable advantage as three mega-trends continue to unfold, AI, consolidation and cloud. Let's start with AI. Since inception, CrowdStrike has been and will continue to be at the forefront of leveraging AI to drive better customer outcomes and efficiencies within our own business. In addition to industry-leading detection and rapid remediation for customers, utilizing AI has benefited our business by lowering costs and yielding higher margins. One example of AI benefiting our financial model is Falcon Complete. For years, our use of AI has enabled us to rapidly scale that business to a leadership position with an exceptional product margin that exceeds our overall company gross margin. The margin profile and scale we have achieved for our managed offering would not have been possible without our innovation in AI. While others are just now jumping on the AI bandwagon, we have transformed cyber security with an AI-powered cloud business from inception. Generative AI is transforming the world and security is no exception. Large language models or LLMs are only as good as the data on which they are trained and human-annotated content mix for the best training data driving better customer outcomes, relies on having a data advantage, and the context derived from that data. While we expect that LLMs will become commoditized over time, the data on which they are trained will not. CrowdStrike is uniquely positioned to benefit from this new technology. Our dataset spans petabytes and captures trillions of new events daily from our global fleet of sensors. Combined that with our over 10 years of attack data and threat graph that has been paired with high-quality human analysis from OverWatch, complete intelligence and incident response services and you get unrivaled telemetry. Simply put, we believe CrowdStrike has a sustainable data advantage, the most powerful and unique set of correlated human and machine-generated data across all of cyber. Our data advantage creates a unique competitive moat yielding better models, better automation and better outcomes. We see the rapidly growing adoption of generative AI as a democratizing force within cyber security from both an adversarial and protection standpoint. From an adversarial perspective, we expect that the adoption of LLMs will lower the barrier of entry for malicious actors to create sophisticated cyber-attacks. Generative AI is expected to make it even easier for less advanced attackers to crack nation-state-caliber campaigns. We believe this will catalyze even greater demand for modern cyber security technologies like Falcon. From a protection standpoint, we see generative AI as a democratizing force by dramatically lowering the learning curve for practitioners transforming even a novice analyst into a power user. With all this in mind, we introduce Charlotte AI, an exciting new generative AI security analyst utilizing CrowdStrike's high fidelity data advantage. We believe Charlotte AI will power a newly minted Tier-1 analyst to yield the results of an advanced Tier-3 analyst, the net benefit to the customer, faster results, better security outcomes, and lower overall costs. Charlotte AI represents CrowdStrike's latest innovation in helping security teams worldwide contend with the cyber security skills gap, respond to threats faster and reduce operational cost. Charlotte AI will uniquely benefit from a continuous human feedback loop with our OverWatch, Falcon Complete, and Intel teams. This continuous feedback loop on human-validated content is critical. And because of this, no other vendor in cyber will be able to match CrowdStrike's approach to generative AI. Demonstrating our commitment to lead and protect the industry through this next wave of innovation, we teamed up with AWS to develop powerful new generative AI applications that help customers accelerate their cloud, security, and AI journey. Through this initiative, CrowdStrike and AWS will bring together their solutions and teams to keep customers safe across a range of AI services, while meeting stringent security requirements. CrowdStrike already has a leadership position in helping protect AI innovators. A perfect example of this is a recent expansion with a B2B generative AI research and development company. This customer leverages significant public-cloud resources to support their solutions, also aware of the dangers others have faced from adversaries compromising client environments. This customer expanded to Falcon Cloud Security Complete to support this small team with fully managed coverage, provide both cloud runtime protection and partial monitoring across their multi-cloud environment, and scale seamlessly with their growth, all without having to deploy multiple products or hire more people. Another mega-trend continuing to unfold in cyber security is consolidation. The macro backdrop has only accelerated the need for customers to reduce vendor sprawl, reduce agents, reduce costs, and protect their businesses with a best of SaaS platform. On average, enterprise customers can realize over 200% ROI with Falcon. With ROI results like this, it's no surprise companies turn to CrowdStrike to protect, power and drive efficiencies for their businesses. In Q1, net-new ARR from our million-dollar plus customers grew year-over-year even as these larger more complex deals can have longer sales cycles. We delivered $174.2 million in net-new ARR for the quarter, which exceeded our stated assumptions. Our momentum with large customers, record Q2 pipeline, and success tracking deals to close, gives us confidence in the back half of the year. In Q1, we closed over 50% more deals involving eight or more modules, compared to a year ago. We believe this speaks to increasing customer demand for consolidation using the Falcon platform. When we look at our pipeline for the remainder of the year, we expect this trend to continue, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver net-new ARR growth in the back half of the year. Over the past few months, I have personally met with many of our customers, prospects, and partners. These conversations all centered on the same topic, customers want to consolidate their security stack that Falcon and drive greater cost efficiencies while unlocking new capabilities. Let me share a few recent customer wins highlighting [indiscernible] companies you've CrowdStrike to consolidate while improving your cyber security outcomes. First, our wins with two new Fortune 100 customers. These organizations are consolidating on Falcon, a single modern XDR platform unifying their process security across their different business units. Each of these new CrowdStrike customers purchased multiple modules with one adopting nine modules displacing legacy and next-gen vendors in their environment and standardizing on CrowdStrike. One of my favorite customer win this quarter was with a regional healthcare customer brought to us by our partner, Dell. This organization was frustrated by the volume of false positives generated by their legacy security product which hampered their security teams' efficiency and have secured critical incidents. Recognizing the increased value they could gain by modernizing their security stack and consolidating on CrowdStrike, this customer adopted eight Falcon modules, including Falcon Complete, Identity Threat Protection, and LogScale in a seven-figure total value deal. In addition, our managed services teams have catapulted CrowdStrike to a leader position in the Forrester Wave for managed detection and response and the number-one market share position for the second consecutive year in Gartner's NVR for managed security service report. CrowdStrike's MDR leadership extends beyond our Managed Services and into our MDR partner ecosystem, of the top 25 MDR vendors by market share defined by Gartner, 88% have built their MDR services on top of the Falcon platform, showcases Falcon as their modern MDR platform of choice. We are proud that the Falcon platform powers so many different partners, enabling them to build their businesses on top of CrowdStrike. Our industry-leading partner ecosystem continues to expand rapidly contributing meaningfully to our growth. CrowdStrike recently entered into a strategic partnership with Pax8, the leading MSP cloud marketplace with over 30,000 MSP partners across North America, EMEA, and APJ that serve the SMB market. This partnership provides CrowdStrike a born-in-the-cloud route to market for MSP consumption and a prime opportunity to displace the legacy AV and NextGen product vendors Pax8 partners use today. MSPs are increasingly turning to the Pax8 marketplace for ease of product purchase, rapid software deployment, and fully-integrated billing to run their businesses, including cyber security. Pax8's MSP partner base will now be able to protect their end customers with the same cutting-edge XDR technology selected by the world's leading and largest enterprises. Our momentum in the public sector continues to expand. Public sector wins in the quarter included a Falcon Complete win at a top 20 US government contractor and a win with a major US federal agency. Today, we announced CrowdStrike was granted an Impact Level 5 or IL5 Provisional Authorization from the Department of Defense. IL5 certification positions us well to extend our reach into the massive defense, IT and cyber security market. The competitive environment has not changed since our deep dive in April, where we disclosed that eight out of 10 times when an enterprise customer tests, they choose CrowdStrike over Microsoft and our win rates across all competitors remained strong in the quarter. Organizations today, more than ever before, need security partners with deep expertise that can stop breaches, while driving efficiencies in their security programs. However, from Microsoft, companies experience added complexity, less coverage and higher costs. While enterprise customer with over 50,000 employees told us the upgrade cost of moving from Microsoft E3 to E5 would be at least $2.3 million more than their CrowdStrike subscription and that's just for the upgrade. With Microsoft's excessive annual cost increases, this will go to $4.7 million by year five, excluding the additional costs required to support [indiscernible] solution or increase staff to manage the extra complexity. When customers map it all out, they quickly realize that using Microsoft E5 for security is more expensive, requires more headcount, and increases their cyber risk. The cloud is the third megatrend representing a long and sustainable tailwind for our business. The cloud is rapidly emerging as the new adversary battleground. We have observed a 95% year-over-year increase in cloud service exploitation and a 288% increase in threat actors that know how to operate in cloud environments. Securing cloud assets is paramount today and will continue to grow in importance. As a leader of protecting some of the largest and most critical cloud companies, we have seen strong net-new ARR growth for module deployed in public clouds. Our Falcon cloud security offering unifies our agent and agentless cloud-native security capabilities into a single offering that's easy to deploy from build to run-time across all major cloud environments and it's driving incredible customer momentum as customers consolidate their cloud security replacing multiple cloud point products with Falcon. Tying this all together, the rapidly evolving and expanding threat environment demonstrates why it is so critical to have your endpoint, cloud identity, and data protection on one unified, modern XDR platform, Falcon. We've covered a lot today and you can see that our relentless innovation continues to widen the gap between CrowdStrike and the competition. In closing, I will reiterate a few key points. First, CrowdStrike has a clear data advantage built over the past 12 years by combining our unmatched AI and human-threat intelligence expertise. For customers, CrowdStrike's advantage meets better, faster, and more cost-effective cyber security. For our business, CrowdStrike AI excellence shines through our differentiated business model efficiencies. Second, we ushered cyber security into a new era with the introduction of Charlotte AI. Third, companies must consolidate their security stack to reduce complexity, reduce agents, and reduce costs without sacrificing coverage or security. They need to protect their cloud environments from built to runtime with a single unified platform. To achieve this, customers choose CrowdStrike. And fourth, we believe that in addition to building a winning platform, we built a robust business model capable of generating rapid growth at scale, earnings and durable free cash flow. With that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results.\nBurt Podbere: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. We delivered a strong first quarter even with the continued challenging macro-environment with revenue, subscription gross margin, operating income, net income, and free cash flow, all exceeding our guidance and reaching new records. We believe our financial performance speaks to the strength of our business model on the operational excellence ingrained in the fabric of CrowdStrike's culture, which includes diligence and discipline when balancing growth and profitability. The demand environment remained resilient, although we continued to see increased deal scrutiny and longer than typical sales cycles, especially for larger consolidation deals with our relentless focus on sales execution, we achieved Q1 net-new ARR of $174.2 million, which was above stated assumptions. We ended the quarter with ending ARR reaching $2.73 billion, up 42% over last year. The quarter was well-balanced with the mix between new logos and expansion cross-sells, net-new ARR similar to Q4. We continue to be very pleased with the success of our land and expand strategy with our dollar-based net retention rate once again above the 120% benchmark in Q1. Subscription customers with five or more, six or more, and seven or more modules now represent 60 to 40 and 23% of subscription customers, respectively. Moving to the P&L, total revenue grew 42% over Q1 of last year to reach $692.6 million. Subscription revenue grew 42% over Q1 of last year to reach $651.2 million. Professional services revenue was $41.4 million setting a new record for the 11th consecutive quarter and representing 48% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, we also saw strength in Europe, the Middle East, and Japan. International revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our first-quarter non-GAAP gross margin performance was outstanding with both total and subscription non-GAAP gross margins ascending to new heights. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 78% and subscription gross margin crossed the 80% milestone for the first time. Our investments in data center and workload optimization drove our gross margin improvement in the quarter. As we have said in the past, we expect subscription gross margin to fluctuate by up to one point on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we balance optimization investments with capacity growth and new platform functionality. We expect these investments to drive further margin enhancement in the future as we continue to execute on our long-term plan to drive subscription gross margin sustainably above 80%. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $424.6 million or 61% of revenue versus $291.0 million last year, or 60% of revenue. The sequential increase in sales and marketing reflects the timing of in-person events and marketing programs. In Q1, our magic number was 1.0 and we achieved a rule of 75 on a free cash flow basis, both metrics reflecting the continued efficiency of our model. First-quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 40% year-over-year to reach a record $115.9 million and we reported operating margin of 17%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q1 grew to a record $136.4 million or $0.57 on a diluted per share basis. Our weighted-average common shares used to calculate first-quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 241 million shares. We also reached GAAP profitability for the first time in company history. While we are very proud of this milestone, we have yet to reach sustained GAAP profitability. Q1 benefited significantly from fewer net-new hires in Q1 which we expect to pick up throughout the remainder of the year, albeit at a much more moderated pace in comparison to FY 2023. We believe reaching this milestone demonstrates that our financial model will deliver GAAP profitability in due time. We ended the first quarter with a strong balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to approximately $2.93 billion. Cash flow from operations grew 40% year-over-year to a record $300.9 million. Free cash flow grew 44% year-over-year to a record $227.4 million or approximately 33% of revenue. Before I move to our guidance, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. We are raising our revenue guidance for the fiscal year and maintaining our net-new ARR assumptions for the first half and fiscal year which call for a 10% year-over-year headwind to net-new ARR in the first half and in line to modestly up net-new ARR for the full year. Our strong Q2 pipeline and momentum with large consolidation deals give us confidence in the remainder of the year including the back half where we expect to return to year-over-year growth in net-new ARR. Also as a reminder, given the timing of expenses, billing seasonality and the midyear ESPP purchase, the second quarter is generally our lowest cash flow generation quarter of the year. This year we expect to see more pronounced seasonality and maintain our target of achieving 30% free cash flow margin for the fiscal year. As we discussed during our Investor briefing in April, this is inclusive of estimated full-year impacts from billings duration and cash taxes, balanced by the positive tailwinds of increased operating leverage, higher interest income and lower CapEx. And lastly, our assumptions on interest income, cash outlay for income taxes, and capital expenditures are unchanged. For the second quarter of FY 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $717.2 million to $727.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 34% to 36%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $116.4 million to $123.8 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $129.5 million to $137.0 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.57, utilizing a weighted-average share count of 242 million shares on a diluted basis. We are raising our revenue and profitability guidance for the full-fiscal year 2024. We currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3000.5 million to $3036.7 million, reflecting a growth rate of 34% to 35% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $498.9 million and $526.2 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $562.8 million and $590.1 million. Utilizing $243 million weighted-average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.43. George and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. You may proceed.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. And congrats on the DoD authorization.\nGeorge Kurtz: Thanks, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: George -- Hey, Burt, hey George, thanks for taking my question here. George, maybe for you, and I'll just stick to one here. Can we just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in legacy endpoint share gains? I mean clearly, CrowdStrike has a broader platform beyond just endpoint, but I'm curious, just given the macro and everything happening, curious how you feel about that opportunity for continued share gain in endpoint specifically.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, I feel good about that opportunity. And if you look at our current market leadership and -- market-leading leadership at 17.8% for modern endpoint security. It's still a very fragmented market and we continue to take share from the legacy players that are in the market. Again, when you look at different geographies, obviously, we've got heavier penetration in North America, but there's many geographies in the rest of the world that still have to be penetrated deeper, particularly in converting those legacy players. So I feel really good about it. It's a fragmented market. If you just look at the numbers and the ongoing conversion of legacy technologies into next-gen players like CrowdStrike will continue for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with SVB MoffettNathanson. You may proceed.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I wonder if you could give us a sense of what kind of impact you saw in the business from the disruption from the banking crisis in March, both on kind of ARR linearity, and maybe even billings in the quarter.\nGeorge Kurtz: Hey, Sterling. How are you? So number one, let's talk about the impacts -- number one, let's talk about the impacts of the banking crisis. So for us, there was not a material impact on ARR from the banks. I think the impact of churn from the banking industry was really de-minimis. And we continue to close deals with regional banks in the quarter. Banks in particular need robust cyber defenses. Overall gross retention remained high and best-in-class. So we felt pretty good in terms of that particular piece of the segment. In terms of overall billings, billings is, of course, for us quite cyclical and it is driven primarily through seasonality. So Q4 has our largest deals and the renewals that came up have an impact and then the impact falls into Q1, which we would see overall decrease. So that's how we think about it. And as you know, the business is focused on ARR, as opposed to billings, which can be -- which can have whipsaw effects and the focus on ARR, just gives you an idea about the overall health of the business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. You may proceed.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking the question. Hey, George, one for you. Thanks for the update on AI. I'm just curious. As it increases the attack surface, just curious if you've seen any threats recently that may have been exploited new threats as a result of the proliferation of some of these new models that are out there and I have a quick follow-up.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, we continue to see and we have seen for some period of time adversarial AI. So the use of AI, specifically by the adversary to try to deceive security systems. So that's been going on for some time. I think what we're seeing now with generative AI and LLMs is the fact that it becomes very easy for even a novice adversary to be able to have the same capabilities as a nation-state to create new exploits, new vulnerabilities to be able to deliver phished emails, et cetera. So that will be an ongoing effort. And again, we're really excited about Charlotte AI, which we announced this week. I think it's an absolute game changer for us and the company and what we're able to do to really compress the workloads for analysts and provide a lot of the intelligence that we have and our analysts have right through the Falcon platform. So we'll continue to monitor that, but that's been an ongoing activity that we've seen for some time.\nJoel Fishbein: Great. And just as a follow-up on this CrowdStrike Falcon Complete XDR, can you just talk about how the new release may increase your competitive advantage in that space? I think there's a lot of noise out there.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, there is a lot of noise and when you look at XDR and what we've talked about with our use of AI in terms of really driving additional leverage in the business, it does help to automate a lot of what we do and we can now provide that level of automation in a complete offering, because XDR is still -- as an industry it is still an immature technology. I think wrapping it with a complete service really allows customers to have peace of mind, they can allow us to take in that third-party data, leverage the models that we've already built to get better outcomes, faster response, and drive down their overall operational costs.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey guys, good evening, and thank you for taking my question. George, I have a question for you as well. So I'm curious how you're thinking about monetizing some of the new AI services that you've released? I mean, is this something that going to drive more sort of top-of-the-funnel conversion? Do you think it's going to drive more demand for LogScale? Is there like explicit SKUs that you're offering? Just curious how you're thinking about that. I know it's pretty early days.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, it's something that's really foundationally built into the platform and we believe it's going to drive a lot of additional adoption of modules and platform usage throughout the customer base. So we'll start there. As it evolves over time, we'll look to see if we will monetize it with specific SKUs, but I think first and foremost let's get into the customer base, let's iterate it, let's leverage the data advantage that we have because as I've talked about in the earnings call, we've got 10 years of being able to train these algorithms and I think as most know, it really is the human interaction that allows those LLMs to shine and we've got I think a real advantage because we've got 10 years of attack paring, if you will, with data and how the attacks work that can be used for training. So we're going to get it out in the customer base, continue to iterate it. And then I believe it will drive more adoption of the platform modules and then we'll see how we'll monetize it after that from a separate SKU perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. You may proceed.\nMatt Hedberg: Great guys. Thanks for taking my question. You're talking about a lot of confidence in the second half net-new ARR acceleration, when you sit back and you look at it, there's a lot of things to be excited about, what do you think are the biggest drivers of that growth? And maybe I missed it, but are you still targeting low 30% ARR growth for fiscal 2024?\nBurt Podbere: Yes. Hey, great question. So first, let's talk a little bit about the second half, obviously, the easier comps in the back half, right? So that's number one. And then, what really gives us confidence going into the second half is three things. One is pipeline. We see momentum and deal activity rapidly building for the second half. It really started in the middle of Q1 and we saw that momentum to be able to build the pipe from the second half. So that is number one. Number two, products, we were excited about LogScale, George talked about it a lot, we've given some examples. So we think that there is a great opportunity with LogScale, we're also seeing momentum in cloud. I think that's something that we're really excited about and AR power XDR now with Charlotte and George has already talked about that. And then third, our partnerships. Whether it's Dell or Pax8 or others that are coming online, we think that can be something that will move the needle for us in the second half. So the key here is cyber security remains mission critical. And I think customers want to consolidate and drive down TCO, more than ever and Falcon is designed to do exactly that. So I think that when you look at the overall module adoption and we talk about -- we closed over 50% more deals involving eight or more modules this quarter compared to a year ago, that gives -- that speaks to the power of our platform. And so all those things give us confidence about what we talked about in -- for the second half and stated assumptions remain same.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great, thank you. Thanks for taking the question, so I was wondering if you could just expand on your partnerships with Dell that you talked about last quarter, just wondering how much it contributed into the quarter, whether you have enough visibility from that partnership yet to factor that into your new guide -- your new revenue guidance for the year and if that's actually driving any traction at SMB sector? Thanks.\nBurt Podbere: Yes. Good question. So one, we're tracking plan, we're still early days obviously with Dell. We called out a one-seven-figure deal with a regional healthcare company that was brought to through our partnership with Dell in the quarter. And obviously, with any new alliance, it does take time to gain traction. So the numbers that are coming from that Dell partnership, we anticipate to grow over time. But in terms of a big piece of the quarter, not yet, right, we have great expectations. But like anything else, those things do take time and -- but we are still affected about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. Can you give us an update on -- two questions. Can you give us an update on going down market and your traction with Falcon Go, the SMB focus area? So what's the -- how -- what kind of competition do you see there given that Microsoft is stronger in the down market? And second question, we have seen many companies in this space having sales to existing customers, much stronger than sales to new customers, there is slowdown in sales to new customers. Can you give us kind of the data on where do you see the growth coming from and existing versus new customers? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure, I'll start out and then Burt can add anything if he needs to. So Falcon Go has been a success for us. We continued to target the SMB market. I think I called out in one of the prior earnings calls, how we organized ourselves internally. We've got a specific focus and a leader on that. We've seen a lot of success there and we'll also -- I need to call out the pairing to our success in the MSP market and partnership like Pax8 which really allows us to get those lower-cost offerings out to customers through managed service providers. So, it's a big market for us in SMB, it's a very highly fragmented market. You have some players there, but we've been successful because customers are looking for outcomes. You talked about Microsoft. Customers routinely come to us after they get hit with ransomware, after they have an issue and looking for next gen solution, it doesn't depend on signatures. So we see success there, we've got to ramp our channels up. We're working with Dell and others and managed service providers. But I feel really good about that opportunity and that will continue to grow over time.\nBurt Podbere: I'll take the second part of the question, Tal. So we really haven't seen a material difference in terms of the mix between [indiscernible] install base and net-new logos versus last quarter. We do think that we will see over time as our installed base gets larger, they have more opportunities to sell to our installed base. Having said that, we still think we have a lot of headroom in terms of net-new logos. We have a long way to go and we talked about that on earlier calls. So overall, we're really pleased with our opportunity in both net-new logos from a new logo standpoint and from a cross-sell upsell opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, guys. George, last quarter I believe while maybe during the update you talked a lot about some of the Microsoft displacements, and I know you've actually just kind of mentioned that. And in that context, maybe shifting to -- from a model perspective, any specific trend that you can talk to us about this quarter versus prior quarters with respect to the leading modules, the identity, some of the emerging ones versus everything that you're seeing from Microsoft in that respect. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. I think I'll start with consolidation and I'll reference back to what I spoke about in the prepared remarks. Every customer that we spoke to and I spoke to many, many customers at RSA. And even throughout the quarter, it was really about consolidation. I think we've done a good job of showing a very cost-compelling model for them where they're actually paying less than [indiscernible] for the security pieces particularly CrowdStrike and they are getting better outcomes. So there are many customers that have said, we want to consolidate on CrowdStrike. We want to buy more. Obviously, these take -- these sort of bigger deals take time. They have more deal scrutiny those sort of things, but that's what we're seeing and that's I think reflected in what we saw this quarter and certainly what we've seen growing in the pipeline as customers want to do more with CrowdStrike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. You may proceed.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. My questions for George. So this is the first quarter ever that new ARR declined for you guys whereas most other's decline started quarters ago, like several quarters ago. Tal asked about competition in the SMB market, but what about demand, we started to hear some weakness in the SMB in the mid-market and we realize that that's largely a greenfield for you. So it might be harder for you to tell, but are you seeing any changes in that market demand this quarter versus previously?\nGeorge Kurtz: No, we actually saw strong demand and results in SMB. I think we've got a great model, we've got the right technology for it and we're solving outcomes, right? When you look at not only the technology itself, obviously, you can buy Falcon Go as a customer, but you can also buy Falcon Complete, we have many SMB customers, many, many that are Falcon Complete customers. Why? Because it's a very compelling proposition from a price perspective, they couldn't even fill one head for the cost of what we're charging them and they're getting the best in the world in terms of security. So, we have not seen a slowdown in SMB. We've got, I think really good traction there. And at the end of the day, as you pointed out, it's still a fragmented market and it's a smaller part of our overall revenue. So we see great future opportunity with it and didn't see any impact of last quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Essex with JP Morgan. You may proceed.\nBrian Essex: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe for Burt. Nice milestone of hitting GAAP profitability. I guess that we would love a little bit more color around your commitment to maintaining GAAP profitability, what should we expect? And you also had a really I think for the first time, stock-based comp decline sequentially, what is kind of the outlook there? And how should we kind of frame out your view and your plans to drive GAAP profitability and balanced growth and profitability going forward? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Thanks, Brian. Great question. So one, overall, we've had a very methodical approach in how we look at the various aspects of the model. So first, we focused on gross margin. And you can see the progress that we've made there. Second piece was focusing on non-GAAP profitability and free cash flow, free cash flow, as you know, which is 30%. And that is something that's ongoing. Third evolution is GAAP profit which we will continue to focus on and drive towards achieving sustainability. Of course, SBC is the biggest piece of that. We continued to manage SBC and we are going to be mindful balanced with retaining the best and the brightest talent that's paramount for us. We also look to dilution. Our dilution, we feel is in a good place, less than 2% this year, strive to keep it under 3% in the year that are coming. So overall, we are very pleased with hitting the GAAP profitability and believe it demonstrates the power of model and that we are disciplined in our growth and we are disciplined in how we see the market today. Everything we do is by the time, it's not a fluke. We think about it. In terms of where we can extend and how we can extend, but for us with the SBC, we really focus on making sure we are able to get the best talent and retain the best talent and attract the best talent. That's how we really think about it. And for us, we're going to look forward to when we reach sustainability, but we have other things we're going after right now including that retention and attraction.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. You may proceed.\nJonathan Ho: Hi there, good afternoon. I just wanted to maybe ask a little bit about sort of the success that you've seen with these additional add-on modules. Can you help us understand maybe where that success is coming from, whether it's some of your newer products in areas like cloud or EASM? Or is this an instead of multi-product sales from your more existing endpoint capabilities? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure. While we've seen strength in many different areas, we had some incredible wins with LogScale. I'm really seeing the momentum on that, there's a real need in the industry for faster, better, cheaper logging and customers are looking for a solution, so that was great to see. I think when you look at identity, this is one of those areas where just like EDR in the early days, it wasn't necessarily budgeted and what we're starting to see now is that companies are actually budgeting in current and future budgets for identity, just like XDR -- sorry, EDR as an emerging product. And the third area is cloud. We had some incredible cloud wins. We've packaged up our offering to include both agent and agentless on the cloud as basically one SKU, customers can use it, they love the fact that they're getting results from both agent and agentless technologies. And that is a true differentiator in the environment -- the competitive environment. So overall, when you look at a lot of these areas that I have called out in the past, it's full-speed ahead on them and we continue to add more capabilities and I'm really excited about the product lineup that we have for this fiscal year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. You may proceed.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you for taking the question. First, a quick clarification from Burt, if you could just comment on average duration this quarter and if there was any change. And for George, so I know you've been incorporating AI into Threat Graph and the broader platform for years, but on Charlotte, you alluded to commoditizing LLM but might you leverage open-source and develop your own LLM space under a dataset to provide additional value there. Just curious to hear a little more on how you may augment existing LLM to potentially drive a greater wedge, so to speak, based on your inherent [indiscernible]. Thanks.\nBurt Podbere: Hi, Greg. I'll take the first part of that question. So as you know, we called out that we expect to see in the long-term, the shift from multi-year deals to one-year deals. I think that's traditional in software. But we do not see a material shift in the trend this quarter when compared to the last quarter. So just be very, very clear on that point. Deal durations are getting shorter, but are expected and it remains within the parameters of how we've modeled out our overall business.\nGeorge Kurtz: Yes, Greg, on the question regarding LLMs, obviously there is some great technology that's already out there. And I think our view is to leverage LLMs. It's a very similar concept to be able to leverage different cloud providers, leverage the LLMs that to you for a particular purpose. It doesn't mean we couldn't build our own, but I think what's important and I called this out in the prepared remarks is the fact that the training is one of the areas that really makes an LLM shine and I think many people have seen that just with their understanding of ChatGPT, these things have to be trained or you get hallucinations in terms of the results -- spurious results if you will. So from our standpoint, we believe the pairing of the Threat Graph with annotated threat data over the last 10 years is and will continue to be a sustainable advantage of barrier entry because we've already done a lot of that kind of human training and we can take advantage and interchange LLMs within our own dataset to provide the best outcome depending on what we're looking for. So we'll leverage what's out there, we may build some of our own, but I think more importantly, we've got the right dataset to get the training, the way we need it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. You may proceed.\nAlex Henderson: All right, thank you so much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what your assumptions are in terms of your pipeline, in terms of deal sizes, duration, closure rates and price relative to the conditions. Are you baking in a little bit more conservatism in Tier assumptions on some of those parameters? Are you expecting the deal sizes to continue to go up, but then push out in the time to close deals? And what are you assuming around closure rates in this environment? And if you could feather in a little bit on the federal, I would love it. Thanks.\nBurt Podbere: Thanks, Alex. Few things to unpack there, so let's start with in terms of larger deals, again we closed over 50% more deals involving more modules this quarter, compared to a year ago. I think this really speaks to the fact that customers really want to do the consolidation play, they want to continue to leverage Falcon platform as a means to get the right outcomes at the right price. In terms of the overall environment, so first big picture in the macro, we don't see the macro improving now and for the rest of the year. So with that as a backdrop, when we think about deal durations, yeah, sure we think deal durations are going to be shorter. I think people are going to -- in terms of their size, they are going to be longer to be able to consummate. And that goes to the additional scrutiny that we're continuing to see from companies looking to do bigger deals takes more time. And so, when we think about that all perspective, we know that there's going to be deals that are going to be more difficult to close within a particular quarter. And so, we've modeled that in. I think that overall with respect to some of the other metrics that you had mentioned, I think that for one, I think that for our net-new ARR, we are going to maintain the assumptions that we stated previously. I think that's the right thing to do. With that, I'll pass it over to George to talk about that.\nGeorge Kurtz: Sure, as I mentioned in prior comments, we're excited about IL5, it does open up, I think a much bigger federal opportunity. We had some really nice wins in the quarter. And that's one, again it's slow and steady, you've just got to get in. It may take a while to get deals done, but they last a long time and they are big and medium, so we continued to drive forward on that and I think this IL5 certification opens up more doors for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nIttai Kidron: Hi, thanks. George, thanks for the great review on AI. I guess the question is for Burt. With the benefits of AI, as George described them, how soon can you raise your long-term margin targets?\nBurt Podbere: Well. For us, we're really pleased with where we're going with our margins, across the gross margin, you saw the progress that we've made there. We've talked about the continued developments for optimization, in our -- certainly in our data centers, as well as our cloud workloads. And then the progress that we're making in AI, we built into everything we do and we've been doing it for 10 years. We do anticipate to continue to see those improvements. And just out of memory -- just as to remind you Ittai, we've been doing AI from the beginning, just as we did cloud from beginning, it was -- those two were hand-in-hand and the good news there is we've got, as George had mentioned, over 10 years, all of that AI and the training on the AI and that's a massive head-start over any one of our other competitors.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. You may proceed.\nPatrick Colville: Hey, thank you so much for squeezing me in. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that in the quarter, you saw increased deal scrutiny and longer sales cycles. Can't you just double-click on that comment? I mean was that increased deal scrutiny and longer sales cycles, was that like late in the quarter in the kind of in March-April? Or is that towards the beginning? And I guess, any more color or clarity you gave on those comments would be fascinating. Thank you.\nBurt Podbere: Sure, so the comment was meant to be throughout the quarter. As we go into deals, we're seeing customers want to consolidate more and that takes more time because they're adding more modules with us. So they're looking to spend more with us, but then reduce other spends from other competitors, and in a sense, they're actually thinking about better outcomes overall in the security space and beyond, and how to get it at a cheaper price. And that's again, things that we've talked about from day one. And we're seeing that happen today. So, throughout the quarter that we're seeing both additional deal scrutiny what I just mentioned, but also they do take longer and that's throughout the entire quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ruykhaver with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. Hi guys. So I'm curious, when you look at data retention requirements, particularly XDR for threat hunting, but I guess increasingly going forward for these large language models, can you just talk about the issue the industry is facing around the increase in data retention requirements and pre-associated cost? And I know you've already talked positively on LogScale adoption, but those costs with LogScale versus other solutions, is there any way for you to quantify what that looks like the advantage you have?\nBurt Podbere: Well, specifically around LogScale, you see a massive increase in terms of our compression algorithms and our ability to store data and I think one of the areas where you look at LogScale and just a simple view of it is better, faster, cheaper and that's what we've seen, we've had some big customers that are using that really as their, call it, their data like if you will. They can store lots of data on-prem or many of them in the cloud for a very cost-efficient -- in a very cost efficient manner and they still get the performance. So I think the architecture, which is a modern architecture around LogScale really does give us an advantage there. And that's been borne out by customers in their own testing.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Rosenblatt. You may proceed.\nCatharine Trebnick: Hi, thank you for the question. Last -- at the last Analyst Day or the one before you talked about your coalition partnership, and can you talk to cyber insurance as a -- is that still a tailwind -- this tailwind -- biggest tailwind than that was last year? Is that dissipated? Thank you.\nBurt Podbere: Yes. I think Cyber insurance for a lot of customers is very difficult to get and it's actually gone up in cost. So we have many customers that as part of CrowdStrike acquisition are baking in their ability; A, get cyber insurance; and B, in many cases, being able to reduce the overall cost because many of the cyber insurance providers recognize with CrowdStrike in place overall risk is dramatically going to be reduced. So that's what we've seen. I don't know that there is any anomalies one way or another, but it's continued problem in the industry to actually get cyber insurance and it is part of our overall value proposition to a customer to be able to; A, help them get it; and B, reduce their overall cyber insurance costs.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to George Kurtz for any closing remarks.\nGeorge Kurtz: Well, I just wanted to thank everyone for their time and attention, and we appreciate the questions and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
