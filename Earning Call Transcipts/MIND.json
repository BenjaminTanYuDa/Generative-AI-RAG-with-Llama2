A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to your host, Ken Dennard. Please go ahead, sir.\nKen Dennard: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the MIND Technology fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings conference call. We appreciate all of you joining us today. With me are Rob Capps, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Cox, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Rob, I have a few housekeeping items to run through. If you'd like to listen to a replay of today's call, it will be available via webcast by going to the Investor Relations section of the company's website at mind-technology.com or you can listen to a recorded instant replay until December 21. Information on how to access these replay features was provided in yesterday's earnings release.

Furthermore, as we start this call, please also refer to the statement regarding forward-looking statements incorporated in our press release issued yesterday. And please note that the contents of our conference call this morning are covered by these statements. With that now behind me, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Capps. Rob?\nRob Capps: Okay. Thanks, Ken, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll start by addressing some key achievements during the quarter and highlights of our results. Mark will then provide a more detailed update on our financials, and I'll return to wrap things up with some remarks about our outlook. First, I want to address two very significant achievements for MIND. During the quarter, we took a meaningful step towards streamlining and focusing our operations with the previously announced sale of Klein to General Oceans for cash consideration of $11.5 million. We utilized a portion of those proceeds to repay our term loan, eliminate our outstanding debt. This transaction, which resulted in a financial gain of almost $2.4 million, has provided us with important liquidity and financial stability with which to exploit the remarkable growth we're seeing within our Seamap business. Now, this brings me to our second achievement. We ended the third quarter with a record backlog of $37.4 million, over double where it was just three months ago. I'll touch on this in greater detail shortly, but I believe this unprecedent backlog is indicative of our specialized capabilities and product lines. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we entered into a supply agreement with a major international seismic contractor. We expect to receive initial orders under this agreement shortly. This means that we start the fourth quarter of this fiscal year move into next fiscal year with a record backlog and confidence in continued order flow. Our Marine Technology Products revenue during the third quarter was approximately $5 million, and this was significantly lower than we had anticipated. We experienced delays in the delivery of certain components, which prevented us from getting these orders completed, out the door and recognize as revenue before quarter-end. These orders, which total from $5 million to $6 million, are expected to be delivered in our fiscal fourth quarter. This situation clearly demonstrates that supply chain issues, while much improved from a couple of years ago, are still with us and can impact results in particular periods. The good news here is that the orders are not lost, merely delayed. The magnitude of our backlog does give us better visibility and therefore better ability to manage our procurement process. However, increased level of activity also means increased capital requirements. Based on the orders that were delayed and the schedule of other orders in our backlog, we expect a significant increase in revenues in our fourth quarter. We continue to believe that MIND is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the favorable market dynamics to achieve sustainable top-line improvement. We think our record backlog is indicative of the growing demand for our differentiated Seamap product lines such as GunLink source controllers, BuoyLink positioning systems and SeaLink streamer systems. We believe this continued positive backlog trend and the early benefits of our framework agreement to reflect the strength in the underlying market and demonstrate that we are the partner of choice for companies looking to acquire high-quality and versatile marine technology products. We continue to believe that the current market environment is advantageous for MIND. Each of our three key markets, exploration, defense and survey, remain loaded with opportunity. Having completed the sale of Klein in August, we now operate a more streamlined and focused suite of products, and we're better positioned than ever to deploy our product lines into a variety of end markets. Additionally, our team continues to develop new and innovative ways to adapt and implement our technologies to meet the evolving needs of our customers. In addition to traditional energy-related opportunities, we are seeing new applications for our Seamap technologies. As an example, our backlog includes over $5 million related to one of our SeaLink ultra-high resolution 3-D seismic streamer systems. This system is intended for use in surveys required for offshore wind farms and other green energy projects. There's also a growing opportunity for MIND to provide seismic streamer repair services, not only for SeaLink streamers but also for products manufactured by others. Within the maritime defense and security market, we continue to believe that our Sea Serpent passive array system, which is derived from the commercially developed SeaLink system, is a significant and economical solution for various demanding applications within this space. We are also optimistic that through our collaboration agreement with General Oceans, we will see increasing interest in our Spectral Ai Software Suite and find further applications for this technology. And with that, let me let Mark walk you through our third quarter financial results in a bit more detail.\nMark Cox: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. At the outset, I would like to point out that with the sale of Klein, those operations have been treated as discontinued operations and prior period results have been restated to reflect that. Accordingly, the results from continuing operations that we reported yesterday and our discussing here today, including prior period comparative data, do not include amounts related to Klein. They include only our ongoing business. As Rob mentioned earlier, revenues from continuing Marine Technology Products sales totaled approximately $5 million in the quarter, which was up about 64% from approximately $3 million in the same period a year ago. While we experienced several delays during the third quarter that resulted in some revenue getting pushed into the fourth quarter, we believe the strength we are seeing in all our key markets and the growth in our backlog of orders positions us well for sustained higher level revenue in the coming quarters. Gross profit during the third quarter was approximately $2.3 million, which was up meaningfully when compared to gross profit of approximately $862,000 in the prior-year period. This represents a gross profit margin of 45% for the quarter. We're pleased that we were able to deliver some higher margin orders during the quarter despite the overall lower sequential revenue levels. Revenue in the quarter was largely driven by sales of spare parts as opposed to sales of full systems. These transactions, while smaller in size, tend to generate higher gross margins. Our general and administrative expenses were approximately $2.9 million for the third quarter, which was down slightly when compared to approximately $3.5 million from the second quarter and $3 million for the same period a year ago. The sale of Klein is allowing us to streamline our operations and thereby reduce some costs. We've recently taken some actions in this regard, including selected headcount reductions, reducing the size of our Board of Directors, and reducing the compensation for the remaining members of the Board. We also believe that the more streamlined operations will result in lower professional fees and travel costs. We will begin to see the impact of these changes in the fourth quarter of this year, but will not recognize the full benefit until next fiscal year. In the third quarter, the impact of cost reduction measures taken earlier this year was partially offset by severance cost and higher professional fees. Our research and development expense for the third quarter, which relates only to our continuing operations, was approximately $508,000, up slightly from the comparable period a year ago. These costs are largely directed toward the development of our next-generation streamer system and continued development of our Spectral Ai Software Suite. Operating loss for the third quarter was approximately $1.5 million, which was nearly a 50% improvement from the loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $1.1 million compared to a loss of $2.4 million in the third quarter last year. Overall, we reported net income of approximately $568,000 for the third quarter of this year, driven by a gain of approximately $2.4 million on the sale of Klein. As of October 31, 2023, we had working capital of approximately $16.5 million and approximately $5.6 million of cash on hand. After factoring in net proceeds from the Klein sale completed in August, our liquidity position is significantly improved. Additionally, as a reminder, upon the closing of the sale of Klein, we repaid and eliminated our high cost debt, leaving MIND debt free today. I'll now pass it back over to Rob for some concluding comments.\nRob Capps: Okay, thanks, Mark. Our conviction about the future of MIND Technology has only been strengthened by recent achievements. We've taken the necessary steps to streamline our operations and focus on profitability. We believe that this company is better positioned now than ever. Our Marine Technology Products continue to penetrate a variety of industries and markets, which I believe is a direct correlation to the work that our team has done to develop and continually adapt our technology to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe that the record backlog that we have achieved is just the beginning, as there are still significant opportunities for our Seamap unit and our other initiatives. Market conditions remain favorable, and we genuinely feel that the robust customer interest and engagement that we've seen to date signifies that the market adoption of our product lines is gaining traction. We're confident that MIND is headed in the right direction. We look forward to building on the strong foundation that we've constructed. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in business comes at price, that being the capital needed to execute the growing business. As you probably know, we did declare and pay a dividend on preferred stock for the quarter ended October 31, 2023. However, it remains about $4.7 million as accumulated dividends from prior periods and the ongoing dividends accrued at a rate of about $3.8 million per year, while our liquidity and financial position have much improved, we do not believe that our current operations can generate the capital needed to exploit and grow our business and, at the same time, pay ongoing or accumulated dividends on the preferred stock. Therefore, while no decisions have been made and circumstances can change, we currently believe it unlikely that we will declare further dividends on our preferred stock for the foreseeable future. As we experienced this quarter, and have traditionally seen, there will likely be revenue variation between quarters due to a variety of challenges and unforeseen circumstances, as well as simple customer delivery requirements. With that said, we do believe the general trend will be one of increased revenue. The favorable market trends, robust customer interest, and substantial growth of our backlog continues to give us confidence that sustainable, higher-level revenue is achievable. Looking forward, we anticipate meaningful financial improvements in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2025 as we convert our record backlog to revenue. We're encouraged by the current macro environment and believe that our streamlined, differentiated, and market-leading suite of Maritime Technology Products is uniquely positioned to capitalize on favorable customer demand. We expect to continue adding new orders in the coming months and to then utilize this momentum to drive meaningful shareholder value. And with that, operator, we can now open the call up for some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyson Bauer with KC Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nTyson Bauer: Good morning, gentlemen.\nRob Capps: Hey, Tyson.\nTyson Bauer: I'm trying to get a where we are today kind of look at the company, and all this is going to lead up to the eventual question of where we need to get to. But you ended the quarter $37.4 million of backlog, $5 million to $6 million of that is because we had deferred revenue that will fall into this quarter. So, you have approximately $32 million backlog. That is a significant increase from $17 million at the end of July. Where are you kind of today and where your backlog stands relative to also your recognized revenue in the quarter? Has that $5 million to $6 million been realized already along with your other expected revenue you thought you were going to have? Or is this a situation where the components delay really has pushed everything to the right of the calendar, so we don't necessarily have that catch-up where all of a sudden we have a $12 million, $15 million quarter?\nRob Capps: Yeah. So, Tyson, we -- those delayed orders have partially been shipped. They're not all completed. They've been partially done. We do expect them all done by the end of the quarter, much by the end of the calendar year. So, I think we will see a bit of a catch-up, to use your term, in this quarter. So, it's not a bad way that's getting pushed out all the way. There's a certain component that was two months late coming to us from a supplier so just didn't give us enough time to get everything built and out the door when we originally scheduled to.\nTyson Bauer: And are these components that are just drop-in for -- like we see with the automakers, they need a chip, they build the vehicle and then they can put the chip in and then ship it. Is that the situation here where it's a drop-in component that you can make the product and you're just waiting on that last component to complete it, or is this something at the beginning of the process that just kind of halts the whole system and build?\nRob Capps: Well, it's kind of halfway in between, that's the way I'd describe it. It certainly is a drop-in and we can complete much of the system, but we have to drop-in this component before we can then complete everything else. So, it's a little bit of both. So, we certainly have been able to continue with production and have things ready. We have components sitting on the bench right now that we're dropping-in, to use your term, to finish this. I think, of course, then there's software to be burned in, things of that nature, part of the process that has to happen at the end. So, we have been able to continue with the process, like the thumbnail of your question.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And just for the sake of clarity, because I think you mentioned this in the last call, if the expectation you did $5 million, you thought you had $5 million to $6 million that was deferred, that implies that you thought you were going to be able to do $10 million to $11 million in the quarter. I think in the last call you thought that the quarters would be somewhat similar, obviously, depending on some timing issues. Does that mean you're walking into this quarter with the expectation that you thought you were going to do, say, roughly $10 million, and the $5 million to $6 million is an add-on, or -- give us a little better clarity on that?\nRob Capps: No, I understand where you're going. The answer is yes, although I understand just the caveat, things can happen and we can have something drop-in unexpected, we do better. We get something pushed to the left or to the right rather, for whatever reason, but fundamentally, your analysis is correct.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. When we look at where your accounts receivable were or was at the end of July compared to where it was, obviously, you have the benefit of Klein drops out of that, obviously. Also, you didn't have the sales that were realized in the quarter. Does that anticipate, if we go back to that July level and that level of business that you're expecting to do since you haven't made all the deliveries as of yet, a $3 million working capital requirement, just on that alone, not looking at additional inventories in that, which would leave you at the end of the fiscal year, roughly $2.5 million of cash left?\nRob Capps: There's a lot of calculus that goes into that, Tyson. So, I'm not sure I'd draw that exact conclusion. Certainly, delayed shipments mean delayed cash flow coming in, but there'll be some catch-up there as well. We have had to use working capital to buy components, so there's some benefit there. There are some contracts that we have advanced payments on, prepayments from customers. So there's lots of things that go into that calculus. But I think the message is, with increasing business, that means there is an increase in working capital requirement, be it receivables, be it inventory. And so, that's the reason we're trying to take the position we are.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. Well, that's why we're -- ultimately all these questions are going to come down to what operational level do you think or believe you need to be at to reinitiate that dividend, also meet your working capital needs given the growth outlook. And we've already seen, say, on your inventory an $2 million increase that was offset by the reduction in accounts receivable. So, at $5.5 million where you ended the quarter, are you anticipating being able to maintain that level, or is that level going to be further stressed at the end of the year? And what level is comfortable for you to reexamine whether you have the operational results to re-initiate the dividend and meet your requirements both?\nRob Capps: So, Tyson, the answer there is we don't know for sure, because we need to understand how the business is going to -- how the cash flow and how the working capital requirements are going to flow as this business flows through the production cycle. So that's the reason we want to be conservative here and keep our powder dry, if you will. So that's the whole reason why this is a huge backlog improvement. I mean, this is unbelievably larger than anything we've seen in the past. So, we think it only prudent to make sure that we first serve the business and can execute on the business before we make any decisions on the preferred stock. So, we just haven't decided yet.\nTyson Bauer: And foreseeable future, if we get through and we play a little catch-up, as you just mentioned, and we start kind of getting a more stabilized flow as long as component supply is there, does that imply by the end of Q1 of the next fiscal year you should be in a more comfortable position on where you're at to make that decision? I mean, is foreseeable future one, two quarters or is it 'don't expect anything for the next fiscal year'?\nRob Capps: I said I don't know at this point. That's what we're trying to understand. So, I can't give you more guidance than we have here.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. The pending contract structure, obviously you're not going to name who and it probably doesn't make that big of a difference. Are those more for components, whole systems that you are going to be supplying, which obviously is going to be far more lumpy? And does that imply that they're operating as kind of a middleman as opposed to the end user, which is typically your customer?\nRob Capps: They're for full systems. They are the end user. And there is a production schedule that we're working out with them over the next several quarters.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. So, when we see orders from them, these are going to be for whole systems. So, we're looking at the $1.5 million all the way up to $4 million type systems that they would be purchasing at a time?\nRob Capps: Correct. Maybe even some smaller systems as well. But yes, the answer is yes.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And is this a multi-year agreement?\nRob Capps: It is.\nTyson Bauer: Is there an accordion-type feature to this where you've set the price and it's just a function of that price will be good for what they need going forward?\nRob Capps: No, no, no. And no -- but I don't want to get into specifics for some committed reasons as you might imagine.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. But we should see before the end of the year some more details and color come from this contract that will make it clear and obvious to the rest of us, the scope of it?\nRob Capps: I usually will. I think I'm very confident about that.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. All right. I mean, for right now, I'm sure Ross is in queue. We'll let him take over. But it looks like, at least operationally, you're where you want to be. It's just what are we going to do on the decision on that accumulated deficit on the preferred and what's it going to take to actually catch-up business-wise to basically create that residual value for the common once we satisfy the preferred side. So, hopefully, we'll know that in a quarter or two.\nRob Capps: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Taylor with ARS Investment Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Taylor: Well, Tyson was right.\nRob Capps: Don't tell him that.\nRoss Taylor: Yeah, well, he knows it now. You and I have had a number of conversations about the imperative nature of paying this dividend because there is no way you can -- I mean, the equity is a residual here. And for those of us who own equity, for -- we want and need you to get this preferred out of the way so we can start to accumulate the value that is going to grow in this company. And it strikes me as -- a couple questions first. What was the inventory, working capital impact or drag last quarter from the deferred sales? Obviously, you were building stuff. You had costs that you incurred that didn't go out the door as sales to generate revenue. So, what kind of impact was that?\nRob Capps: Our inventories over the last six months are up about $3 million roughly.\nRoss Taylor: Okay. So, as you sell that out, we should start to see that cash flow should come in?\nRob Capps: Yes. But understand we're going to continue building...\nRoss Taylor: Yes, I understand. As you build backlogs and accounts receivable, you and I talked about the fact that you can actually do other steps, factor accounts receivable, things of that nature, that the cheapest debt you're really going to get is the preferred, but it also absorbs. Right now that preferred probably has about $46 million worth of value. Your equity has about $8 million worth of value. It strikes me as I said before that if I want my equity to grow, you got to solve the problem with the preferred and it's got to be imperative. And one of the things that you guys do is you keep promising us it's going to work as a company and then just when you get back on the road, it's like, if you didn't think you could pay the fourth quarter dividend, why would you pay the third? Save the money and pay it in the fourth, so you can start a string of winning. I'm starting to think you guys are managed by the same people who manage the Seattle Mariners, which is being from Seattle, not a compliment. But I think that -- I mean, I'm wrestling with what your thinking is because I'm hearing you say we worry about this, but in fact, you have a lot of other alternatives to finance. You -- quite honestly, if I were sitting on your Board, I would say if I vote against the dividend, the only other question is, I hire a banker for, A, to short the company, or B, to give it to Tyson to do an ATM and raise $5 million, because by my calculations, if you could buy back, say 500,000 shares for $5 million, you actually create $3.33 a share, an extra value for the common stock, which is basically a better than 50% increase over what it went out at. It just strikes me as we really need to get focused on being a public company and developing the confidence of the Street. As I said, every time it seems like you're about to turn that corner, you go into another dark place. How do we keep from being there? And answering Tyson's question of you don't know, I understand you don't know, but you've got to have a plan and that plan's got to be using these -- you and I talked about other ways of raising capital and using these other ways because I think that you want to actually be able to eventually use that preferred dividend or preferred as a way to raise capital. It's a better way than going into the general financing market, I would think. Am I wrong?\nRob Capps: Ross, I understand all your comments. Believe me. Nothing is news to me on this side. I understand completely.\nRoss Taylor: It's not news, but, I mean, to be honest, and the idea that you drop the comment, you haven't made a decision and you drop it with two weeks left in the year is just, Rob, we've talked and I've known you for a long time and I've been a real loyal shareholder. But you know how frustrating it is to watch, you basically come in and do something like this with two weeks left in the year because it just sets -- it sets you back so much more than potential loss of one quarter's dividend. It sets you back to where you all the street cred you're building is going to have to restart. And I think the Board needs to recognize that. You got cash and you got stuff coming on and your credibility as a public company -- I mean, it's one thing if you're private, but you're public. So, you have a duty to your shareholders. And I think that duty -- I'd rather see you issue equity to loop me a little bit on it -- to loop me on equity even heavily because getting rid of that preferred particularly can get rid of it at $10 or $12 a share if you can buy back, that's a huge win for us shareholders. So, we've got to be thinking about the game plan, okay? I know this isn't a happy conversation, but I'm not happy with the way this is falling together. So, I feel like we're right back where we were a year or two ago except for we thought we were so much better.\nRob Capps: Okay.\nRoss Taylor: Thank you.\nRob Capps: All right. I appreciate the comments, Ross.\nRoss Taylor: And give Tyson a call about the ATM if you don't pay the dividend. I think he'd love the business.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments.\nRob Capps: All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I look forward to talking to you at the end of our fourth quarter. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ken Dennard. Thank you. You may begin.\nKen Dennard: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the MIND Technology Fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today. With me are Rob Capps, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Cox, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Rob, I have a few items to cover. If you'd like to listen to a replay of today's call, it will be available for 90 days via webcast by going to the Investor Relations section of the company's website at mind-technology.com or via telephonic recorded instant replay until September 21.

Furthermore, as we start this call, please also refer to the statement regarding forward-looking statements incorporated in our news release issued yesterday, and please note that the contents of our conference call this morning are covered by these statements. And now, with that behind me, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Capps. Rob?\nRob Capps: Okay. Thanks, Ken. Now as I believe you all know, in August, we took a significant step with the sale of our Klein unit. Today, I'd like to begin by discussing that transaction and the rationale for it before discussing our second quarter 2024 results, as well as our current view of market conditions. Mark will then provide a more detailed update on our financials. I'll then wrap things up with some remarks about our outlook. With the strengthening outlook for our Seamap unit, that we'll discuss further in a moment, we thought it was important to streamline MIND's operations and address the financial requirements associated with our growing business. When the opportunity to sell Klein arose, we saw an opportunity to achieve both those objectives. Our Klein business unit was responsible for approximately $3.1 million in revenue during the first six months of this fiscal year, but contributed an operating loss of about $911,000. On a pro forma basis, had the sale taken place at the beginning of the year, MIND would have reported a positive pretax income as opposed to the $1.2 million loss we reported. This further demonstrates the basis for our decision to part ways with the Klein business unit and focus our attention on other operations. As we've previously disclosed, consideration from the sale was $11.5 million in cash. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay the $3.75 million term loan from earlier this year. After transaction cost and the loan repayments, the net proceeds available to us amounted to about $7.3 million. An added benefit from the sale is the licensing arrangement and collaboration agreement with the buyer, General Oceans. This provides an important opportunity to realize value from our Spectral Ai software suite, which MIND retains. Through this arrangement, we hope to realize recurring licensing revenue while continuing to enhance Spectral Ai imported to applications beyond [indiscernible]. Our second quarter results came in roughly in line with our expectations. Revenues dropped off a bit sequentially due to the scheduling of deliveries. That was largely anticipated. This activity is not unusual, and I'll remind you that revenues often fluctuate in our business from time to time for a variety of reasons that are often out of our control. We continue to believe that MIND is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the favorable market dynamics to achieve a sustainable top-line improvement long term. As of July 31, our backlog of firm orders for Seamap stood at $17 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we received additional orders totaling approximately $5.4 million. And we also have confidence that in coming weeks, we'll be in a position to announce additional sizable orders that we feel are imminent. These booked and pending orders involve a variety of products, including GunLink Source controllers, BuoyLink positioning systems and SeaLink streamer systems. We believe this continued positive backlog trend is indicative of the favorable market conditions and the differentiation of our Seamap product lines. We remain confident that this momentum will carry throughout the remainder of our fiscal 2024 and beyond. We believe the current market environment is advantageous for MIND. Each of our three key markets, exploration, defense and survey, are loaded with opportunity. With our operations now streamlined and focused, we are better positioned than ever before to deploy our product lines into a variety of end markets, and our team continues to develop new and innovative ways to adapt and implement our technologies to meet the needs of our customers. In addition to traditional energy-related opportunities, we're seeing new alternative applications for our Seamap technologies, including offshore wind farms and other green energy projects. There's also a growing opportunity for MIND to provide seismic streamer repair services, not only for SeaLink streamers, but also for products manufactured by others. Within the maritime defense and security market, we continue to believe that our Sea Serpent passive array system, which is derived from our commercially developed SeaLink system, is a significant and economical solution for a variety of demanding applications within the space. We intend to continue leveraging the favorable macroeconomic trends, the differentiation and versatility of our product lines, and a sustained customer demand and interest that we're seeing to drive robust order activity and growth in our book of business in the near term. Now, I know many of you are interested in our plans regarding dividends on our preferred stock. While our liquidity position is much improved, we are continuing to evaluate the working capital requirements associated with our growing backlog of business. Accordingly, at this point, we have not made a decision regarding accrued or ongoing dividends. We will, of course, update you once any decisions are made. As many of you are aware, we held our Annual Shareholder Meeting on August 30. Included on the agenda was the proposal for the approval of a reverse stock split that would enable us to regain compliance with the NASDAQ listing standards. Our shareholders approved this proposal. This was an important and necessary first step, and NASDAQ has granted us until November 15 to regain compliance with a minimum [mid-price] (ph) requirement. We're now going through the internal mechanics of implementing the reverse split and will provide an update on the specific framework as things evolve. Now, I'll let Mark walk you through our second quarter financial results in a bit more detail before I come back.\nMark Cox: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As Rob mentioned earlier, revenues from continuing operations totaled approximately $8.8 million in the quarter, which was roughly in line with the revenues of $8.7 million in the same period a year ago. Our Seamap segment delivered revenue of approximately $7.6 million during the quarter, which we believe is largely indicative of the continued strength that we're seeing in the exploration and alternative energy markets. Gross profit during the second quarter was approximately $3.3 million, which was marginally down when compared to gross profit of $3.5 million in the prior year period. This represents a gross profit margin of 37% for the quarter, a 330 basis point decrease when compared to the same period a year ago. Gross profit margins for the Seamap segment were up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year, while current period gross profit margins in the Klein declined significantly from the prior year period. Decline in gross profit margins for the Klein segment was due to sales of higher-margin multi-beam sonar systems in the prior year period not recurring in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our general and administrative expenses were approximately $3.5 million for the second quarter, which were down slightly when compared to the $3.9 million from the first quarter and $3.8 million for the same period a year ago. The improvement over the prior year period is mainly due to reductions in executive level headcount as well as other cost management initiatives that we've implemented. Our research and development expense for the second quarter was $842,000, which was up slightly both sequentially and when compared to the year ago period. Consistent with prior periods, these costs are largely directed towards our strategic initiatives, including synthetic aperture sonar and passive sonar array. Operating loss for the second quarter was approximately $1.5 million, which was essentially in line with a loss of approximately $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $687,000 compared to a loss of approximately $1 million in the second quarter last year. As of July 31, 2023, we had working capital of approximately $13 million and cash of $494,000. After factoring in net proceeds from the Klein sale in August, our liquidity position is significantly improved. As Rob noted in his opening comments, upon the closing of the Klein sale, we also repaid and eliminated our high-cost debt that we incurred earlier this year, and MIND is once again debt-free. I'll now pass it back over to Rob for some concluding comments.\nRob Capps: Thanks, Mark. We're more excited than ever for the future of MIND technology. We've taken the necessary steps to streamline our operations, and as we sit here today, we are a more focused and efficient company. We think the opportunities for our Seamap unit are significant. The coupling of favorable market conditions and our differentiated and versatile product offerings is a recipe for long-term success. We're seeing greater customer interest and engagement and historical highs in order flow, which contributes to our high expectations for meaningful and sustained growth. We're confident that MIND is headed in the right direction. We look forward to building on the solid foundation that we've constructed to date. Our Seamap technologies continue to gain traction with customers globally for a variety of end uses, and our team has done a great job adapting our technologies to meet the evolving needs of our customers. As we look forward to the back half of the year and into fiscal 2025, we intend to capitalize on this positive momentum to drive improvements in our financials. The experience this quarter and have traditionally seen, there will likely be revenue variation between quarters due to a variety of challenges and unforeseen circumstances as well as simple customer delivery requirements. With that said, we do believe that the general trend will be one of increased revenue. The favorable market trends, robust customer interest and growth of our backlog continues to give us confidence that sustainable higher level revenue is achievable. We've worked hard and taken the necessary steps to position MIND as a leading producer of differentiated marine technology products, and we're excited about what the future holds. As of today, we're debt free. We have a much improved balance sheet and liquidity position. We intend to continue capitalizing on the favorable market conditions, strong customer interest and engagement and robust order flow to achieve improved results, which we believe will generate meaningful shareholder value going forward. And with that, operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyson Bauer with KC Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nTyson Bauer: Good morning, gentlemen.\nRob Capps: Hey, Tyson.\nTyson Bauer: Do you happen to have, just a bookkeeping question right off the bat, kind of the cash balance of where you were as of this morning or last night?\nRob Capps: I mean, yeah. I'm not sure if I want to talk about that specifically. But again, if you look at where we were at the end of the quarter, $0.5 million or so, we've added $7 million or so from the sales, so that's going to give you a sense of magnitude.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And then have you had cash conversion? Obviously, you had some significant accounts receivable with the lower revenue, so I'm guessing just that timetable of converting those receivables to cash?\nRob Capps: Yeah. I mean that -- we'll certainly continue to do that. But also remember, we have a large backlog that we are starting to build, so there's ongoing needs there as well. So this is a combination of things.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. On -- if we look at the first six months in Seamap, approximately $18 million. You're talking about some kind of revenue growth as we go forward. I'm guessing you're basing that off that $18 million for Seamap. That would imply at least $36 million for the year, if you have any kind of growth between $36 million and $40 million depending on shipment timings and some other things that can throw a monkey wrench into that. But as of right now, is that kind of the view that you have, is between $36 million to $40 million of revenue?\nRob Capps: Again, not wanting to get too specific, but I think again, as far as a sense of magnitude, you're headed in the right direction. I think the interesting thing is we have that history for the first six months that I think, more importantly, if you look at our backlog activity, it gives us visibility for the balance of the year and into next year as well, which is very important for lots of reasons. But you mentioned that the thing that we have to keep in mind is lots of things can happen that cause a particular shipment or two to slide from one way or another. So these -- some of these are sizable orders, a few million dollars. So it only takes one or two of those to have an impact. So just everyone needs to keep that in mind, but the general trend is not different from what you described.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And the margins typically on Seamap, at least historically, have been closer to, on the growth side, what, 50-plus-percent or 50% depending on what kind of capacity utilization and what kind of -- how many you're actually being able to produce and deliver?\nRob Capps: Yeah. Maybe not quite that. I'd say in the high 40s, just kind of where we've seen things historically. We have a reasonable inflow or throughput to the operation. Since we do have visibility going forward, that gives us some opportunities, we think, to be a bit more aggressive in some of our procurement activities as well as in some of our production operations, so we're hopeful to be able to improve that somewhat. But it's really been in the high 40s historically.\nTyson Bauer: And you have been already previously talking about $1 million reduction in your corporate expenses and your G&A expenses even before you did the Klein. Would anticipate some additional savings out of that as we go forward and whatever was allocated to Klein on those corporate. What are you anticipating now kind of as a go forward on those G&A expenses? And then a follow-up, your R&D, was that primarily related to Klein or what portion of that…\nRob Capps: Yeah, not entirely. I tell -- I'm going to defer a little bit here. And when we file our 10-Q later today, we're including some pro forma financials in that 10-Q, which I think will give you some good visibility as to what the impact would have been. We alluded to it in our comments today, but I think that will give you some sense. But essentially, the Klein R&D goes away, which is a significant portion of our R&D. The direct Klein G&A goes away, and we also think there's some ongoing things we can do to continue to streamline the operation. I haven't quite quantified those yet. That's something we're looking to do to just make things a bit more efficient. But again, look at the pro formas in the 10-Q. I think that will give you some good information.\nTyson Bauer: And your interest expense goes away also?\nRob Capps: Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah.\nTyson Bauer: And I guess what I'm leading you to is, and just doing the back of the napkin type of numbers is, should your directors choose to pay forward preferred dividends, the financial wherewithal is there, it may be tight initially, but obviously, you'll have the cash balance. You will have the financial wherewithal on ongoing financial operations to pay that if you decide to do so?\nRob Capps: Yeah. Again, we're just analyzing the overall situation and trying to understand how we can stabilize the ongoing overhead cost, but also what are the working capital requirements going to be to make sure we don't find ourselves in a position like we were a year ago and -- for a few months, and having to really get by on a shoestring. That's not what we want to do. That hurts the operation. So certain things are much improved. Again, you're going to see from the pro formas what the numbers look like, so you can draw your own conclusions. We're just going to take all that into consideration when we make our decisions.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And that decision likely we'll know in early October, which is the time that you have to decide whether to defer or to at least make that October payment on the preferred?\nRob Capps: Yeah, that's correct. That's right.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And really, off the table right now is the accrued amount because we're not in that position to address that at the time being. So the decision is really whether or not we want to pay what is going forward and being current on the forward, and then at some point in the future, make a decision on what the accrued -- whether or not you can back pay?\nRob Capps: Again, I don't want to comment on that, Tyson. We're -- it's all on the table right now. We're just going to look at the overall situation.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. In your 10-K regarding the reverse split, it appears that even though it is until November 15, you will make a decision or a split, if it were to occur, would occur on the end of October, which the implication is if you have to have 10 days above $1, that would have to occur within the next four weeks. So…\nRob Capps: Yeah. You're right about that.\nTyson Bauer: Scenario is that we have a reverse split, one for 10, just throwing that out there because that was in the proxy, will occur or would likely occur at the end of October?\nRob Capps: That is not an unreasonable assumption.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. Oil, $90. Heating oil [dropped] (ph) 40% since July. A lot of tailwinds are building that would be favorable for Seamap. And just to give the listeners a little sense, when your major competitor left the market a year ago, a lot of these decisions on whether or not you get a contract or not is whether the ultimate customer just wants to go ahead and place that order. It's not really a competitive situation where you're going against somebody else as we've seen in years past.\nRob Capps: Yeah. As it relates to source controllers, that is definitely the case. We were pretty much the only game in town. We do have some competition for the positioning systems, BuoyLink, and we do have some competition for the streamer systems, but we are focused more on the high resolution, three-dimensional applications used for survey purposes more than deepwater exploration. So we don't go head-to-head with the deepwater streamer systems. So we do have some competition there, but it's pretty thin, it's fair to say.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And yourself and Mark are not on the Board, correct?\nRob Capps: I'm on the Board. Mark is not.\nTyson Bauer: You're on the Board. The Board is going to ask for your recommendation, being the CEO, and the CFO's recommendation on outlook and financials. Are you willing to share what you would recommend? Even though that -- there's only one cog in the decision that the Board will make ultimately in regards to the preferred and going forward?\nRob Capps: Yeah. No, I don't think we're going to comment on that. The Board as a whole will make that decision, so it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on that.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.\nRob Capps: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Taylor with ARS Investment Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Taylor: Always hard to follow Tyson since he asks all the good fundamental questions. So Rob, I'm just going to -- I'm going to voice some thoughts here. The preferred is actually pretty damn good paper. In fact, it's really good paper for you guys. And there's no way you can go into the marketplace. You paid off a term loan that was, what, [12.9%], I think it was? This preferred is almost 400 bps under that. The fact that you guys and the Board might choose not to pay that off, every time you do that, I mean as an equity holder, I've sat here forever waiting for you guys to get it right. And you're close to getting it right, and I have this feeling you're about the snatch defeat from victory because what if I'm a preferred holder and I get two directors, the first thing I'm telling my directors to do, hire a banker. And there's no way, even with your plans and your confidence, there is that hesitancy, you hear it in your comments, that makes it impossible for this Board to say no to any deal that that banker found that would make the preferred holders whole and the equity holders walk away with next to nothing. And so it's important. Let's get that paper off the back of the common holders, it's just -- it's straightforward. It's -- you can't borrow at 9%. And in fact, you should get to get it going, and that paper is better than going to the bank. I mean eventually, you'll be able to go to the bank and probably borrowing them high single digits at this point in this environment. And it frustrates me, and I just -- I sense that the common holder is just going to be asked to hold a bag and you're going to do a reverse split, get the stock above $1. But in reality, that $8 million, $9 million in value that's attached to the common right now is basically there on the hope that you guys get this thing worked out with the preferred holders. So you are on the Board, and I've known you for a long time, and I know you're a good person and a smart person, and I can't believe that you and this Board are going to let this situation go where you defer the payment again because, as I said, I'm confident Tyson is a smart guy, and I'm sure some of those preferred holders talk to Tyson. And I'm sure they're pretty confident that this company is worth somewhere between $26 million and $50 million or more. And if it's -- if they sell it at $50 million, the preferred holders walk away with everything, and you can't let that happen. Can you?\nRob Capps: Ross, I hear your comments and I take those into consideration. So I hear you.\nRoss Taylor: Yeah. Don't -- I mean, I got to be honest. I don't want to come back to a call having supported you guys for this long and have you guys basically have, for [want of $1 million] (ph) paid to the preferred holders, basically may tell the equity holders that they don't have an asset. I've waited too long. This has not been a successful investment for me, but we can still snatch victory from the jaws of [ignominity] (ph). So let's do it.\nRob Capps: Okay. I appreciate it, Ross. Thanks. I really appreciate your comments.\nRoss Taylor: Thank you, sir.\nRob Capps: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Capps for any final comments.\nRob Capps: Okay. Thank you, Melissa. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I look forward to talking to you at the end of our next quarter. So everyone, have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ken Dennard. Mr. Dennard, you may begin.\nKen Dennard: Thank you, operator.

So now, without further ado, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Capps. Rob?\nRob Capps: Okay. Thanks, Ken. As we did last quarter, we've prepared an updated presentation covering our discussion this morning, and we posted it to our website. I invite you to refer to that at your leisure. Today, I'll begin by discussing our first quarter 2024 results as well as our current view of market conditions. Mark will then provide a more detailed update on the financials. I'll then wrap things up with some remarks about our outlook. We are very pleased with the first quarter results and the start of our fiscal 2024, which we believe demonstrate our ability to capitalize on MIND's favorable market position to continue delivering sustainable top-line improvement. Our financial and operational performance remained strong in the quarter, as expected, resulting in much improved financial metrics across the board when compared to the year ago period. Revenues were up 39% year-over-year, and despite a robust fourth quarter results, we also grew our revenue sequentially. Additionally, we achieved a much improved gross profit margin of 43% during the quarter. Most importantly though, we produced positive operating income. Once again, we also produced positive adjusted EBITDA. The fourth quarter was the first time since we transformed the company that we achieved this, and we're proud to continue that trend in the first quarter. As anticipated, we executed on our backlog, which resulted in significant top-line revenue of $12.6 million. Although we generated substantial revenue in the quarter, we maintained and even grew our backlog. As of April 30, our backlog of firm orders stood at $22.6 million compared to $13.4 million at the same time a year ago and $20.7 million at the end of last quarter. We believe this trend is indicative of the favorable market conditions and the differentiation of our product lines, and we're confident this momentum will carry throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024. We're pursuing a number of other orders and are poised to be successful on many. We hope to be in a position to announce some of these in coming weeks. We remain encouraged by the favorable macroeconomic trends coupled with strong customer engagement and order activity. We believe that the current market environment is advantageous for MIND. We continue to see substantial tailwinds in each of our three key markets: exploration, defense, and survey. And our team continues to find innovative ways to adapt our products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Currently, we're seeing the biggest order growth in our Seamap segment, which is benefiting from the favorable fundamentals within the exploration and alternative energy markets. This growth is supported by the 19% sequential increase in Seamap revenue that we generated during the first quarter, and we expect to build on this momentum going forward. We intend to leverage and sustain customer demand and interest that we're seeing in all of our key markets, drive further growth in our book of business in the coming quarters. As announced in early April, we elected to defer the payment of our preferred stock dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. I know that our liquidity position has been a concern for many of you. Although we've seen improved liquidity has resulted to higher revenue levels throughout the last couple of quarters, we believe it was prudent to retain the cash flow from these activities at this time to complete upcoming and other expected orders. While there are more stringent working capital demands that come with increases in business, I believe we've made progress with respect to liquidity. It remains an area of focus for us. We also are aware of the continued listing standard notice that was sent to us by NASDAQ. We're working through and analyzing options to regain our compliance. With that, now I'll let Mark walk you through our first quarter financial results in a bit more detail.\nMark Cox: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As Rob mentioned earlier, revenues from continuing operations totaled approximately $12.6 million in the quarter, a 39% increase when compared to the $9.1 million in the same period a year ago. Our Seamap segment delivered substantial revenue of approximately $10.6 million during the quarter, which demonstrates the growth that we're seeing in the exploration and alternative energy markets. Gross profit during the first quarter was approximately $5.4 million, which was up approximately 65% when compared to the prior-year period. As Rob also mentioned, this represents a gross profit margin of 43% for the quarter, a 700 basis point increase from the 36% we achieved during the same quarter a year ago. The higher revenue achieved in our first quarter resulted in greater overhead absorption, generating a much more favorable gross profit margin. Our general and administrative expenses were approximately $3.9 million for the first quarter, which were up slightly when compared to the $3.7 million from the fourth quarter. However, as we've mentioned in the past, our G&A expenses tend to be front-end loaded as we incur higher payroll taxes, professional fees and travel-related expenses in the first few months of the year. This recurring trend, although minimal, was evident in our first quarter results. Our research and development expense for the first quarter was $773,000, which was up approximately 9% sequentially, but down 24% from the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with prior periods, these costs are largely directed toward our strategic initiatives, including synthetic aperture sonar and passive sonar arrays. Operating income for the first quarter was $289,000 as compared to a loss of approximately $2.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $913,000 compared to a loss of approximately $1.9 million in the first quarter of last year. As of April 30, 2023, we had working capital of approximately $14 million and cash of $815,000. As noted in Rob's opening comments, we continue to see improvement in our liquidity. I'll now pass it back over to Rob for some concluding comments.\nRob Capps: Thanks, Mark. We remain encouraged by our results for the first quarter and by the favorable outlook in each of our key markets. We are generating sustainably higher revenue while maintaining and growing our backlog of business. And customer demand and engagement remains strong, resulting in better-than-ever quarter flow. We're optimistic that MIND is in a position to build on this momentum in the coming quarters. And we look forward to sharing the fruits of our labor with you. As we look forward to our second quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2024, we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Many of our technologies continue to gain traction with customers globally for a variety of end uses. And as I noted earlier, our Seamap products are playing a significant role in paving the way for MIND's continued growth. We've traditionally seen there will likely be revenue variation between quarters due to a variety of challenges that are often out of our control, such as supply chain issues, tighter vendor credit requirements, evolving delivery requirements, government contracting processes, and technical and production challenges that can impact production and deliveries. However, the favorable market trends, robust customer interest and growth of our backlog continues to give us confidence that sustainable higher-level revenue is achievable. We feel good about where the company sits today. We believe that our development programs will continue to positively contribute. There may be certain unforeseen circumstances that cause orders or deliveries to slide to the right, but we do believe that the general trend will be on of increased revenue. As I mentioned earlier, there are challenges that come with our improving business. We're doing our best to manage these challenges and demands. In closing, we're excited about the future of MIND Technology. Our stable and growing backlog, robust order flow and increased revenue levels are indicative of our technology being in greater demand. We intend to continue capitalizing on the favorable market conditions and macroeconomic environment and robust customer interest and engagement to achieve improved results going forward. We've worked hard to position MIND as a leading producer of differentiated marine technology products. We intend to build on this momentum to generate significant revenue, which we believe will drive meaningful shareholder value throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024 and beyond. And with that, that's our prepared remarks. Operator, we can now open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tyson Bauer with KC Capital. Please proceed.\nTyson Bauer: Gentlemen.\nRob Capps: Hey, Tyson.\nTyson Bauer: You want to start with some operational questions or the elephant in the room on trying to climb out of the preferred dividend hole and what some of remedy possibilities are...\nRob Capps: Up to you.\nTyson Bauer: All right. Let's start backwards, and then we'll figure out if the operations will get us the resolution. On the preferred dividend, obviously, you can defer one more before we get to the six deferred later this fall. Are remedies possible where you can roll those dividends where you're paying maybe ones that are in arrears in essence, you do not have to make one cumulative payment to become whole, there are other options, correct?\nRob Capps: That is correct. You're exactly right. So, we could we could pay one or two or three or -- so you're right. We could pick and choose, if you will. They continue to accumulate, of course, it's either way. But yes, you're right, we don't have to do it all at once.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. Which then also pushes to the right that holds six deferred. As long as you're not six or more deferred, we don't trigger some of those provisions that are within the preferred dividend. So, we could actually roll forward to buy you some time, but also you're then returning capital to those holders which then should benefit the common guys that there will be some residual value left for them also, correct?\nRob Capps: Yes, but let me correct. It's actually, if I'm not mistaken, the provision is once we've deferred six dividends, not that we have six in arrears, I think that then triggers the rights of preferred to name two directors, and that's the only remedy that the preferreds have. I think there's two more before we trigger that. So it's not a catastrophic thing by any means, just to clarify. But that does give us ability to catch up over time, if you will, and return from capital to the preferreds.\nTyson Bauer: And according to your proxy statement, the largest preferred holder still is Mitsubishi.\nRob Capps: That's correct.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. And as your intent, we got two more that buys you some time. You're looking at a, now we'll get into some operational questions, that operations could be there or to satisfy, give you more options as we go through the next six months or really the next four months?\nRob Capps: Yes, I think so. I mean, obviously, as you see, last two quarters, we produced essentially enough EBITDA to make that dividend. So, if we can address, the working capital needs and feel comfortable about where we stand there, then we, operationally, are approaching a point where we could address that.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. Margins, you're seeing some nice improvement. Typically, you have some decent margins on the Seamap with those large whole system sales that you get. Are we looking at the backlog bid margins even showing greater improvements and greater trend improvements as we get some more economies of scale as that backlog grows, as that throughput grows and covering those fixed expenses?\nRob Capps: Yes, there's no doubt there's benefit. The biggest benefit, Tyson, is if we have some visibility down the road as to production requirements, we can be much more efficient in buying, buy bigger lots, things like that. So, we can be much more efficient and we can be more efficient in the factory as well. So that certainly has a benefit. Now, to be fair, the counter to that is there are various inflation out there. So, I think we would expect some improvement, but it is going to be mitigated to some extent by just general inflation and supply chain issues, lead times, things like that are still out there.\nTyson Bauer: You talked about Seamap having a robust market. Sometimes those delivery schedules can get a little lumpy on those system sales. As you look at Q2 or in the next couple of quarters, any ideas on those delivery schedules on whether they're concentrated in one quarter or next, or do we have a fairly even flow?\nRob Capps: Yes. You sound like you've been in some of our operational meetings. We're trying to have a more even flow. So that's the way we schedule things. But as I said, you have some key components that you don't get delivered when they're scheduled to be delivered, and that can slip things a bit. So, I'm reluctant to be too definitive with that just because you have a [$3 million] (ph) order that you can't ship because of some component, then that has a big impact. But we are -- we do have better visibility, I think, this year than we have in the past and not just to Seamap, but that client as well. So, we think we're better able to do some planning and be a bit more efficient. That's something we're really working hard to do.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. In the news recently, there have been a lot of discussions of the Saudis major offshore expansions. I think their oil field offshore, they're trying to double or triple the size of that. [indiscernible] energy analysts yesterday coming out a lot of offshore activities, which you should be a beneficiary of...\nRob Capps: Well, I think it's right. There is definitely seismic exploration offshore that is -- and onshore for that matter, that is contemplated with those projects. And I think any time there's offshore seismic exploration, we benefit from that.\nTyson Bauer: And you really have a lot less competition than people remember from even a year or two years ago with one of your major competitors exiting.\nRob Capps: That's true. When it comes to digital source controllers, we really don't have a competition at this point.\nTyson Bauer: Capital requirements, obviously, we needed that infusion. We talked about that in the last conference call, that $3-plus million. You almost benefit if you do have a little delay just because you get a working capital benefit, say, in Q2 or whatever that helps out your operating cash flows. But in general, your working capital, are we to that stage where we can roll it so there is no real deficit, we're just now into a systematic role on cash conversion?\nRob Capps: Yes, that's a complicated question. I think we certainly are approaching that point, as the cash flow from the last couple of quarters would indicate. But I think the wildcard there is when you get into procurement of larger amounts for more systems, larger systems, then that can create some additional demands for advanced payments, prepayments, things of that nature. You're going to do a larger purchase for -- to buy components for four systems, which is not going to produce the last two until two quarters out. So, it can work both ways. So it's something we have to balance on a, frankly, daily basis.\nTyson Bauer: Okay. So, we might see that accordion feature on those real estate secured financing being utilized temporarily just to get you through a quarter or two, but overall, you're in good shape?\nRob Capps: I think that's fair to say.\nTyson Bauer: All right. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ross Taylor with ARS Investment Partners. Please proceed.\nRoss Taylor: Yes, thank you. A couple of questions quickly. Since you just sort of talking about real estate and the loan against it, where do you stand with the idea of selling that asset or sale of leaseback that asset to capture a more significant amount of capital from it?\nRob Capps: We -- frankly, Ross, we are investigating that as we speak for -- we have two pieces of real estate, the [indiscernible] facility and also in here in Texas in Huntsville. So, we are investigating that. Obviously, the banking situation, interest rates kind of went in the wrong direction for us in the last couple or three months, but I think there certainly are possibilities there. So that's something we're pursuing.\nRoss Taylor: Okay. Second, with the increasing focus by world navies on underwater autonomous system, it would strike me then they need to do substantial increase in mapping in areas in which we intend to operate, particularly in areas like the South China Sea. Are you seeing or do you expect to see an increase in demand for your capabilities, your products and technologies from people like the U.S. Navy perhaps the Koreans and the Japanese who will need to be operating in areas that are contested, expected to be home for a lot of these underwater systems?\nRob Capps: Without being specific, the answer is yes, most definitely. That is definitely driving activity for us.\nRoss Taylor: Okay. And do you think that would be a short or intermediate term time horizon?\nRob Capps: I think we've already benefited to some extent, but I think we'll see that to continue on a significant basis. So that will continue. We'll see current as well as intermediate and long-term benefit from that.\nRoss Taylor: Okay. What's the total outstanding value of the deferred preferred dividend at this point?\nRob Capps: So, it's $44 million, $44 million, something like that, including the dividends -- deferred dividends.\nRoss Taylor: What's the preferred -- what is -- what do you owe on the preferred dividend?\nRob Capps: Approximately $4 million, $3.8 million, $3.9 million.\nRoss Taylor: $3.8 million. Okay. I mean that's, once again, still a substantial portion of the outstanding or the value of the common stock. It does strike me as for those of us who own common stock to get value out of that, we really need to keep that from happening. The end game of this company most likely is a sale of the business unless you can meaningfully increase the top and bottom line. It's hard to -- at this stage, the market cap just doesn't justify being public, quite honestly, it probably is worth a lot more to someone as a private business. And with the way it works, the preferred holders are going to take -- get first cut -- basically first payout as well as the deferred dividends being paid out before anything trickles down to the equity holders. So, the faster you guys can come up with a way to stop that and start to create wealth for the common holders, I think that as a long-suffering common holder, I would appreciate those steps. It strikes me as we're kind of in a situation where this company has meaningfully undervalued, but the way to get it, it's likely going to be sale if we can come up with a pretty near-term solution for turning this into something that people want to own.\nRob Capps: Understood completely.\nRoss Taylor: And lastly, the comment -- the answer you had to Tyson's question, the fact that you can come up with some alternative solutions to stop the bleed, I would think that would make tremendous sense if you can find a way to stop the bleed. You got an eight -- six-person board that would make eight. Honestly, if I were put on that -- if I were on to the Board, I would say the first thing we'd have to do is explore sale. So, I would prefer to -- I think you probably prefer to keep them from getting their two directors who will have disproportionate say because of the level of investment they have in the company.\nRob Capps: Understood.\nRoss Taylor: Thank you.\nRob Capps: Okay. Appreciate it, Ross.\nRoss Taylor: Take care.\nOperator: Mr. Capps, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nRob Capps: Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you again at the end of our second quarter. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."
