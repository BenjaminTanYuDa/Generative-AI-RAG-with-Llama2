I'm pleased to report a strong finish for the year with Q4 revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS coming in ahead of our expectations. Behind that momentum is the Verint's open platform we introduced last year, which enables Verint to deliver tangible AI business outcomes better than any other vendor in our market. The market today is looking to increase the ex-automation and Verint is leading the way. Throughout the last year, we built such momentum, driven by our AI differentiation, and we are raising current year outlook to reflect market demand for AI-powered CX automation. Today, I will start with our fourth quarter trends, then I will discuss our open platform differentiation. And finally, I will review our fiscal â€˜25 outlook and three-year targets. In Q4, revenue grew 12% year-over-year a couple of million dollars above our guidance, driven by strong SaaS revenue growth of 28%. Non-GAAP diluted Q4 EPS came in at $1.07, up 42% year-over-year, $0.08 ahead of our guidance, driven by our revenue overachievement and strong margin expansion. At our Investor Day, we discussed how the Verint open platform and team of AI-powered bots drive bundled SaaS growth. We also discussed how we are tracking AI demand using the bundled SaaS booking metric. I'm pleased to report that in Q4, bundled SaaS new ACV bookings increased 16% year-over-year and the 12 months pipeline for bundled SaaS increased over 20% year-over-year. We expect demand for AI to not only drive bundled SaaS growth, but also free cash flow acceleration. For the current year, we expect over 40% growth in free cash flow and over the next three years, as AI continues to drive growth in bundled SaaS, free cash flow will grow faster than revenue. The customer engagement industry has been challenged for many years with a growing number of interactions and higher customer expectations. Today, brands realize that hiring more workers and increasing labor expenses is no longer a sustainable solution. CX automation provides brands with significant economic benefits and at the same time, increases the addressable market for Verint. For brands, the economic benefit come from the lower cost due to the higher workforce productivity and increased customer loyalty. For Verint, the addressable market increases over time as a portion of the large amount that labor saving by brands will shift to purchasing the AI platform. Today, we estimate there are tens of millions of people around the world involved in customer engagement across contact centers, back office and branches and the industry is ripe for CX automation platforms that can deliver AI business outcomes. We believe Verint is uniquely positioned to lead the emerging CX automation category due to three factors. First, our large customer base across many industries and geographies, which consists of 4 million agents currently using the Verint platform and looking to add AI-powered bots. Second, the customer data we have in the platform is critical to train the bots. And third, our open platform is designed to deliver AI business outcomes better than any other vendor in our market. Successfully delivering AI business outcomes requires much more than just Gen AI models. It requires the combination of three key ingredients: the latest commercial and proprietary AI technology, relevant customer data and business workflows. The Verint open platform and our team of 40 AI-powered bots help brands deliver tangible AI business outcomes across the enterprise. Let's look at what makes the Verint open platform highly differentiated in its ability to turn AI technology into measurable AI business outcomes. It starts with the Verint's DaVinci, which acts as a factory for our bots. Verint's DaVinci allows us to combine the latest commercial open source and proprietary AI and deliver it to all Verint bots from the core of the platform. As they emerge from the factory, Verint bots are training continuously on real-time behavioral data, available in the platform data hub. Finally, the Verint's open platform leverages the workflows customers use every day, enabling brands to benefit from AI business outcomes now. World is innovating at a fast pace and a large team of AI-powered bot is growing. The Verint bots augments not just the agents, but also the supervisor, analysts and other roles. Each Verint bot delivers specific AI business outcome and our customers may purchase one or a team of bots to drive greater ROI. Some of the Verint bots use Gen AI models, where other boards use proprietary models that are specifically designed for CX automation. An example of bots using Verint proprietary AI, customer and workforce data and workflows is the time flex bots, which we announced last week. The business problem this bot solves is the inability of agents to dynamically change their schedules. Today, if agents need to get out of their shift to take a child to the doctor or to watch the soccer game, very often, this request will be denied because of limited supervisory resources to modify the schedule in real time and find a suitable replacement. In other words, the scheduling process is just too manual to provide agents with the work-life balance they increasingly expect. The TimeFlex Bot delivers AI business outcome to solve this problem. Agents can make unlimited schedule changes with no additional supervisors needed. The bot augments the existing supervisors by automating their approval of schedule change requests. For example, a Verint customer using the TimeFlex Bots reported reduced employee attrition, higher employee engagement and millions of dollars in annual savings. Like other Verint bots, the Verint's TimeFlex Bots can be quickly deployed into existing customer ecosystems, reducing operating costs and elevating employee and customer experience. Let me now turn to our Q4 wins. In Q4, we continue to have significant wins across existing customers and new logos driven by our highly differentiated open platform and quick ROI we deliver to our customers. We had approximately 50 orders in the quarter with over $1 million TCV each, including from some of the world's leading brands, such as AT&T, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Instacart and UPS. We had more than 100 new logos in the quarter, including the results company, Christian Dior and SanCor. And as I discussed earlier, our 12-month pipeline for bundled SaaS grew over 20% year-over-year, reflecting demand for AI innovation. I would like to double-click on one large Q4 order. In January, we announced a $49 million TCV order with a five-year term from a leading health care company. This large contract came from an existing Verint customer that was looking to add AI innovation now. Verint's open approach enabled the customer to deploy a hybrid cloud platform, so they could keep what they had on premises and at the same time, leap forward with AI innovation in the Verint Cloud. Let me share some additional details of this order. 50% of the revenue will be in bundled SaaS including more than 10 Verint bots hosted in the Verint Cloud. The other 50% of the revenue will be in unbundled SaaS. The order enables the customer to leverage the openness of the platform and import their own large language models into the Verint platform to future-proof their AI investments. Also, the order enables the customer to migrate their unbundled SaaS solutions to bundled SaaS at their own pace, anytime during the FIVE-year term. We believe this 8-digit order is a great example of our open platform and hybrid cloud approach deliver AI business outcomes now. We are pleased with the strong finish to fiscal '24 and are raising the outlook for the current year. We believe the perpetual license headwinds from the SaaS transition are now behind us. And going forward, we expect growing AI demand to provide tailwinds to a bundled SaaS growth driving overall revenue growth acceleration. Looking beyond this year, Verint is a CX automation category leader and we believe increasing demand for AI, coupled with our differentiated open platform, create a road map to achieve our targets for a Rule of 40 company in fiscal '27. And now I would like to turn the call over to Grant to discuss the financials in more detail. Grant?\nGrant Highlander: Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available, as Matt mentioned, in our earnings release and in the IR section of our website. Differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions and divestitures, including fair value revenue adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, certain other acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, separation-related expenses, accelerated lease costs, IT facilities and infrastructure realignment as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount and frequency from period to period. Let me start with an overview of our Q4 results. Revenue increased a very strong 12% year-over-year to $265 million, a couple of million dollars ahead of our guidance. The large increase was driven by approximately 28% increase in SaaS revenue from a combination of new business as well as the unbundled SaaS renewals that we discussed during our Q3 conference call. Non-GAAP gross margins came in strong at 74.7%, up 320 basis points year-over-year. We are pleased with our gross margin, which has steadily expanded since the spin of our security business three years ago. We believe our ability to increase gross margins reflects the strength of our AI innovation and the business outcomes we deliver to our customers. The combination of our revenue overachievement and strong gross margins drove non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.07, $0.08 ahead of expectations. During our Investor Day, we discussed how we are innovating at a very fast pace in our bundled SaaS offerings, and that we expect bundled SaaS to be our main growth driver going forward. I am pleased to report that in Q4, bundled SaaS new ACV bookings increased 16% year-over-year. I'm also pleased to report that as of the end of Q4, our 12-month bundled SaaS pipeline increased more than 20% year-over-year, driven by demand for our AI innovation. Our pipeline growth is a leading indicator, and we expect bundled SaaS new ACV bookings to accelerate this year and the acceleration of bundled SaaS bookings is also expected to drive free cash flow acceleration and later, I will discuss our free cash flow outlook. Before turning to guidance, I would like to discuss Q4 highlights related to the AI investments we are making to support our road map for becoming a Rule of 40 company. First, we continued our investment in AI ending the year with 1,300 engineers in R&D and cloud operations. Second, we expanded our customer success team with additional resources to drive AI adoption. And third, we aligned our services catalog to our AI offerings, expanding our value realization service offerings and divesting a manual managed services offering. Regarding the services alignment to AI, in Q4, we decided to divest our manual quality managed service offering, which is being replaced by an AI-powered bot. The transaction closed on January 31, the last day of our fiscal year. To assist you in your modeling, the offering generated $25 million of revenue last year, and you can find the quarterly breakdown in our press release and on our website. Turning to our revenue outlook. We believe the AI momentum we experienced last year will continue and we expect our revenue growth to accelerate this year. There are two primary drivers for our faster growth. First, the customer engagement market is ripe for automation. AI adoption is driving strong demand for our bundled SaaS solutions, and we expect bundled SaaS new ACV bookings growth to accelerate from the 16% we delivered in Q4 to 20% this year. Second, we have completed our perpetual to SaaS transition and expect perpetual revenue to be flat in fiscal '25, eliminating prior headwinds from this transition. Our revenue outlook for fiscal '25 is approximately $930 million, reflecting 5% growth compared to fiscal '24 as adjusted for the divestiture we just discussed. Turning to our overall guidance for fiscal '25. On a non-GAAP basis, again for revenue, we expect approximately $930 million, plus or minus 2%. We expect gross margin to increase approximately 100 basis points following strong expansion we had last year. The combination of revenue growth and continued operating margin expansion is expected to drive operating income up approximately 7% year-over-year. And for diluted EPS, we expect $2.89 at the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Regarding below-the-line assumptions, we expect interest and other expense net to average around $500,000 per quarter. Net income from a noncontrolling interest of around $250,000 per quarter. And for the full-year, we expect a cash tax rate of around 11% and approximately 72.5 million fully diluted shares. Let me also discuss how we see the year progressing. Similar to last year, we expect bundled SaaS revenue to grow steadily throughout the year and the level of unbundled SaaS revenue each quarter to fluctuate driven by the timing of renewals. More specifically, adjusted for the divestiture, we expect double-digit revenue growth in Q4, again, similar to last year and low single-digit revenue growth in the first three quarters of the year. For Q1, we expect revenue in a range of $212 million to $216 million, up from an adjusted $210 million in Q1 of last year. At the midpoint of the revenue range, we expect diluted EPS to be $0.54. Turning to free cash flow. At this point in our SaaS journey, I am pleased to report that our free cash flow growth is accelerating. We define free cash flow as our GAAP cash from operations less our CapEx, which includes purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. Looking to fiscal '25, we are targeting a greater than 40% increase in free cash flow to approximately $180 million. Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to be in a very good financial position. Our net debt remains well under 1x last 12-month EBITDA and is further supported by our strong cash flow. Over the last few years, we have steadily repurchased shares at an increasing pace and have reduced our share count by 3 million shares. Over the next three years, we expect to generate about $600 million of free cash flow and expect our largest use of cash to be share buybacks, which will further reduce share count. In summary, we are pleased to have overachieved revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS in Q4 and to be in a position to raise guidance for the current year. As we discussed today, Verint's AI-powered bots deliver economic benefits to both Verint and brands. These economic benefits drive our road map to become a Rule of 40 company in three years with revenue acceleration and margin expansion along the way. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shaul Eyal from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen, congrats on completing a successful year and raising guidance. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's been a while since you've raised your revenue guidance again, if I recollect and serves me well, so congrats. Dan, I wanted to ask what has been driving the recent momentum and what is likely to continue and drive what seems to be healthy demand trends? And also as my follow-up question, any changes within the competitive landscape, especially in light of the changing AI environment?\nDan Bodner: Sure. Thank you, Eyal. We completed the transition. So what's driving our momentum now is in one word is AI, but I'll give you an answer that is more than one word. So we believe the momentum that we had in Q3 and continued in Q4 is driven by the strong demand in the market for CX automation. Now -- we see now that the open platform that we announced last year, it was engaged in the summer. It is resonating very well with customers. And the success we see now is across new logos, customer expansions and also renewals. So we had more than 100 new logos in Q4, and they were primarily driven by AI differentiation. We're driving big expansion projects as some of our large customers are starting to move into AI, and we discussed the health care provider that was adding more than 10 bots in the Verint Cloud and that resulted in a $50 million approximately. And we also see a very strong renewal activity in Q4, and that's really what's driving the 28% SaaS revenue growth that we had in Q4. So as you kind of look into what is the CX automation demand and also your question about competitor, we believe that behind our differentiation is that we drive AI business outcomes now. And we do it better than any other vendor in the market. And the reason we can do it better is because our platform is designed to deliver AI business outcomes. So we saw some really good leading indicators in Q4, and we expect it to continue in the current year. So we mentioned SaaS -- bundled SaaS booking, which is basically what drive AI -- the way drive -- AI drives our growth has been up 16%. And the pipeline that we have for the next 12 months is over 20% growth. And based on where we are at now in Q1, we believe that we'll do 20% growth in Q1, and we expect it for the rest of the year, bundled SaaS bookings going at the ACV booking growing at 20%, driven by AI. So to answer your differentiation, I think the best way to do it is two examples. So let me give you a few, I'll start with this large order, the $49 million order and this customer have tens of thousands of employees. And other vendors in our market basically are all having the same story. They told these customers, hey, if you want to move forward, you have to move your entire infrastructure to the cloud first. And this customer realized that would take them several years and huge disruption, and it's a risky project. And they really more than something now, and Verint told them, you can have AI business outcomes now. And the result is that they are investing in AI, they will deploy 10 bots that they are deploying now 10 bots. They're avoiding this very long, risky and disruptive rip and replace projects. So we are very differentiated in that sense. The customer will move their telephony and other application that they have now on premises, they will move it to the cloud, but we aware, they can do it at their own pace. So the AI innovation is in the cloud, but because we have a hybrid cloud platform, AI innovation is connected to everything they have now, it's working. They like it. They don't see the urgency to do anything with what's working so they can look forward with AI business outcomes now. And another example, this one is from EMEA. This is a new logo for Verint, a little bit smaller, but several thousandâ€™s -- pretty large customers, several thousand people in their workforce. And they originally issued an RSP and invited Verint and many other vendors in end market. Again, the RFP was very much at the beginning was for the entire contact center moving to the cloud. But after they learn from Verint about our open approach and our ability to support the hybrid cloud, they're really fell in love with this idea of AI business outcomes now, so they basically canceled the RFP and awarded the contract to Verint. And maybe the third example I'll give you one from Australia. This customer, again, a Q4 win competitive process against other competitors, the usual suspects. And this one has about 1,000 people -- close to 1,000 people. So again, a little smaller, but what's interesting about this customer is that part of their business priority was to provide personal customer service to their customers. So they did not really want to automate too many things in terms of bots answering the phones because they believe that people should talk to people. They also did not want to offshore their employees. They really have 100% Australian employees, which they know cost them more than offshoring and definitely cost them more than bots, but this was part of their business model. So they realize they have to pay more for those Australian employees, but they were looking for CX automation to reduce costs. And it was urgent for them. They need to do it now. So it became the key requirements in this competitive process. And the outcome was that they chose Verint. I was in Australia in Q4, so I met the customer face-to-face. And it was interesting because they were talking to me about the bots that they didn't purchase. So they purchased quite a few, but they were already so excited about deploying even more bots and we kind of went through this large portfolio of bots that Verint has in the platform and discussed what is the business outcome that each bot can deliver? What is their business priority, why they should do this one before the next one, what level of consumption is right for their more and so on and so on. So I think another example when customers really focusing on AI business outcomes now, Verint is very differentiated.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you so much for that.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Peter Levine from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nPeter Levine: Great, thanks guys for taking my question. Maybe Dan or Grant, maybe help us understand the monetization of these bots. I think you have 40-plus bots. Walk us through what you're charging? Is it usage? Is it per seat? And if you can give us like some kind of uplift to ACV from the adoption of these bots?\nDan Bodner: Yes. So I'll start, Grant, and feel free to add anything that I miss. But the concept is very typical to how AI is being deployed. And especially where it's all about AI business outcomes. We are aligning the pricing of the bot to the outcomes that the customer is expecting. So they can see the ROI they can measure their ROI and they can increase the usage based on the results that they actually measure. So many of our customers that have bots AI in Q4 and I can say that with new logos, almost entirely all the SaaS ACV, the bundled SaaS ACV that we got from new logos was about AI and bots. So it's definitely resonating well with our customers that they are trying to expand with Verint, but also with how we win new logos. It's all about you can start applying those bots to your business model and any volume that is right for you to begin with. We're not dictating to the customer what is the initial consumption level. In some cases, we had minimum consumption because we're not going to do this for a $10,000 deal, but our customers also don't want to bother to deploy small projects. So to your question, how do we -- what's the unit of measure for the bots, it really depends on what the bots is doing. So in the case of the TimeFlex Bot that I discussed before, right, the biggest problem is it's employee engagement. Employees are not able to change the schedules. So sometimes this urgent things in their life, but it can change the schedule, so customers see attrition. Customer see some difficult relations with employees that just -- they don't show up. They asked for approval. The approval is denied, they don't show up because they have to go and do something personal. So there's a lot of issues so they can measure this in loss of attrition -- avoiding attrition, so that's kind of one measurement. The other thing is that there are customers who are trying to hire supervisors to measure a bit more flexible and do all these schedule changes in real time, really not practical, but if they try to do that, they can also measure how many supervisors they want to hire and how they can avoid this cost. And they compare that to the TimeFlex Bot, so if they weren't, if they have, let's say, 1,000 employees, they can decide, I'm just going to give TimeFlex to 200 employees, and I'm going to measure the ROI. And if I say that it's what I like, I will just increase the entitlement in the Verint Cloud and grow through as many as employees as I need. But everybody has its own business outcome. Of course, sometimes we deliver a team of bots because the business problem that customer trying to solve, requires several bots working together. So it's -- there obviously will be bigger. But more importantly, the way we design the platform is that the customer can measure on a very granular basis, the ROI. So AI is now a big buzzword. And our message to customers, which is very differentiated. You're not buying from Verint AI technology. You are buying from Verint AI business outcome, and you should be able to measure the ROI.\nPeter Levine: Sorry, I jumped on late, if you discussed it. But from your last question, you talked about 20% bookings growth throughout the year. look at the full year guide. Obviously, there was a $25 million headwind. Then what's the disconnect between, I think, the uptick you're seeing in bookings growth, ACV growth to the, call it, mid-single digits revenue growth number?\nDan Bodner: Yes. So what we discussed in Investor Day is that because of AI and because AI is only available in bundled SaaS, well, the best way to look at our AI momentum is to look at bundled SaaS growth. But what we had last year is the unbundled SaaS booking declines because the customers are shifting into the bundled SaaS. So the result is 16% bundles SaaS booking growth in Q4 and we're basically guiding to 20%. So we go from 16% in Q4, 20% we expect in Q1 and 20% we expect for the full year. But in unbundled SaaS, which does not include AI, we do not expect growth. So it became a small part of our booking, so it's about 20% of our booking, but the unbundled SaaS booking is not expected to grow. There is no AI involved there. But as I explained before, our customers that have unbundled SaaS solutions can renew in unbundled SaaS, and they can add bundle SaaS AI on top of it, and it's all working as one hybrid platform. So they don't have to do any migration in order to expand in bundled SaaS, but we expect that AI is going to drive bundled SaaS expansions.\nPeter Levine: Okay, so bundled SaaS as a percentage of bookings is how much, 80%, you said?\nDan Bodner: It's about 80%, yes. And it's also more than [Technical Difficulty] pipeline, and that's where the growth of the company, we explained at Investor Day that the growth in our journey to the Rule of 40 is based on bundled SaaS growth, and bundled SaaS is the best metric to measure AI production and bots attachment rates. All that is actually translated into bundled SaaS growth. So bundled SaaS booking is the metric that will demonstrate success in AI and also success toward that Rule of 40 target that we have.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Joshua Reilly from Needham. Your line is now open.\nJoshua Reilly: All right, thanks for taking my questions, and nice job finishing out the fiscal year here. What, if anything, are you doing within the direct sales force to make them successful at selling the AI bots when the competitive landscape for some of these bots is a little more complex and different than the core workforce management solution that you've historically dominated in the enterprise market?\nDan Bodner: Yes. That's very interesting topic. So we launched the platform with the bots mid last year and at the time, we had 25 bots, now we have 40. So we are innovating at a very fast pace. Number of bots increasing, and I expect we'll continue to innovate throughout this year with more and more bots and having that many bots in the platform is differentiating because customer is an open platform. Customers can choose the one that is most compelling for them at any given time and they can expand and so on. But the -- what we did with the direct sales force last year is, first, we enabled them on this open platform so they can explain the benefits of being open and flexibility in a modular approach of bots, so you can buy any bots at any given time. But the other thing that we did is we shifted discussions from technology to business outcomes. And the sales force is pretty good because they have been an enterprise sales force always selling applications, not infrastructure. So they're very good at understanding business issues and solving problems. So I'll give you an example about again, a customer that we engaged with, they wanted AI business outcomes now, but their IT just made a big investment in Gen AI platform. So IT wanted to standardize AI in the company, and they were basically kind of not really very interested in any other AI. They just made a big investment. So what our Salesforce did is, again, we explained the open approach to explain to the business users, why they can solve some really business problems now, but more importantly, then engaged with IT and explain that, hey, if you have LLMs, if you have large language models that you develop, we can import your LLMs into our platform because we are totally open, Verint DaVinci will take any commercial open source proprietary as well as customer provided LLM. And when IT realized that they don't have to really develop contact center business outcomes, because their LLMs will be in the platform doing that for them in the Verint platform. This all discussion went away from let's compare whose AI technology is better, right? We just mutualized this all discussion. And it was about providing them ROI now and IP was really thrilled because it's a win, whatever they developed is being leveraged by Verint, combining the Verint data, so we can train their LLM with our data and a fresh 24/7 and embedding their LLMs into our workflows, so that it can be with no disruption provided to the agents at their fingertips. So all these things that we bring in the platform we're definitely saving them time and providing the value that they were expecting now. So I think that Salesforce is really focusing not on whose AI is better. But what are the business issues prioritize those issues and look at how do you solve these issues and this could be increasing capacity for the agents, increasing capacity for the supervisors, it could be elevating the employee experience, elevating customer experience. There's a lot of different priorities that companies have, but each company can find a box that we'll do something they really need now.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on gross margin. Recurring gross margin was stronger than what we modeled in the quarter. Maybe can you give us some more color on what's driving that higher margin? And how do we think about the -- I think you mentioned the 100 basis point improvement in gross margin this year. How do we think about the mix there between the recurring and the nonrecurring gross margin?\nDan Bodner: Grant, that's for you.\nGrant Highlander: Yes. So the recurring gross margin, obviously strong. And in the fourth quarter, specifically, that was on the back of the unbundled SaaS, the volume of the renewals. So that obviously drove the strong expansion that maybe you didn't have in your models for the fourth quarter. But going forward, obviously, we have, and I mentioned this, right, the revenue will once again have a similar combination of the steady bundled SaaS growing sequentially throughout the quarters in fiscal '25. And that large once again volume and it's a different -- it should make this clear. It's a different set of contracts that are coming up that will be weighted to the fourth quarter again and providing once again the strong expansion of the gross margin overall. So I think it will be, and you'll see it be kind of similar, but what's driving the expansion year-to-year, '24 going in '25 is, once again, we are expecting operational improvements in the bundled SaaS. And once again, given that, that is driving the bookings or driving the revenue growth and the revenue seeing some operational expansion within the bundled SaaS, all of that will help to drive the over 100 basis points that once again, we're looking for this year.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on that. How much of the Managed Services business? Is that factored into that 100 basis point improvement as well? Or did that all...\nGrant Highlander: It is factored in, but it's -- the operational improvement of bundled SaaS is obviously driving a good portion of that.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nGrant Highlander: You bet.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Timothy Horan.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks, guys. Can you give us a sense of how big the bundled SaaS is and what percentage of revenue that is? Secondly, I think you have a guidance out there for 10% growth in a couple of years. It sounds like bookings are going a lot better. I mean can you maybe see that happen in more like 18 months or so? And then third, when you -- these chat bots from customers spend $1,000 on them. Do you have a sense of how much you're saving in labor or other expenses in total? Thank you.\nDan Bodner: Yes. Let me start and Grant you can give the SaaS percentage later. So I think that when customers are looking for AI, first, they're looking for the best solution that they can give them the best ROI, right? So it's not just bot I need to buy AI, but it's the ability to drive business outcomes. I think that the gross margin expansion is -- and we have it now steady, it's the result of really innovation. So when you're delivering strong ROI for customers, they are not really pressuring your pricing, so we're kind of sharing the benefits of the ROI between what the customer get from labor savings to what we get from innovation in bundled SaaS. Now how much ROI. So I gave in the Investor Day some examples that different bots create different savings. So the containment bots can reduce the cost of one interaction from $5.50 to just $0.50, so that's 1 to 10 ratio in terms of cost versus return. And this is a successful containment. This is not just deflection of the call, where the customer calls, talk to bot and then never calls back. This is where we measure that on basis of. We really replaced a person with a bot that gave a full answer to what the customers are trying to do. So again, the quality of the bots are very important. There's a lot of companies that talk about IVAs and how they can do self-service, but successful self-service meaning, successful containment, not just deflection. But on that basis, this bot is generating 1 to 10 ratio. When you look at the TimeFlex Bot, it depends on how much the customer is investing today in flexibility, but we also see customers that have 1 to 10 ratio of ROI, some have lower than that. But many customers today, if the employees want to change their shift once a day, they fire them. They just can't forward employee not adhering to the schedule every day they want to change. With the TimeFlex Bots, we have customer reporting that employees are changing schedule 5 times a day. They want a coffee break. They take 15 minutes of their schedule and they schedule themselves for coffee break. And they take 15 minutes later in somewhere else. So again, the ROI is going to be a little bit customized, and we are helping customers to generate their own ROI models so they can do their internal business justification. But it's always pretty big. This is why AI is so exciting. We're talking about the market has shifted completely from let's just move my telephony to the cloud to no, I need to increase the CX automation. This shift is because the ROI is huge, and because AI just makes it possible. It wasn't possible a year ago. Definitely not five years ago, but it is possible now. We architected the whole platform to do this. So it's open with data and DaVinci AI the core. And all these things are actually making these business outcomes possible now. And the ROI...\nOperator: Pardon me, speakers.\nMatthew Frankel: Justin, it sounds like we lost Dan. I think, Grant, can you please finish this.\nGrant Highlander: Yes. Let me go ahead and address the second part bundled SaaS. So you're exactly right. bundled SaaS is driving the acceleration of growth, what we laid out there in Investor Day, right, was the mid-single-digit growth and accelerating modestly at 26% and then getting the 10% growth in '27. And I highlighted, that's on the back of the bundled SaaS bookings, which then drives the revenue over time. Just to answer the question for perspective, the bundled SaaS in fiscal '24 and again, I'll adjust for the managed services divestiture. It made up 28%, $250 million, a little over $250 million of revenue for bundled SaaS was roughly 28% of our overall revenue, again, excluding divestiture. And as you look at this and what we have trajectory, it will grow about 4 points and make up 32% of the $930 million of revenue, right, around that ballpark. And we expect it to continue just on the pace that we had modeled is going to continue to increase towards 37% in '26. And it would be 40% of our overall revenue by the fiscal year. So then again, driving that 10% growth on the back of that line. So that's kind of the magnitude that we see. We'll still have unbundled SaaS, as Dan mentioned, we give the customers flexibility. They don't have to migrate all of that unbundled SaaS or term licenses. They can get AI without any disruption of the converged migration, and we expect that will come over time as well. So hopefully, that answers the question.\nTimothy Horan: Very helpful. Thank you.\nGrant Highlander: You bet.\nOperator: And, thank you. Okay, thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Matthew Frankel for closing remarks.\nMatthew Frankel: Great. Thank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Of course, feel free to reach out with any questions you have, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Have a good night.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect."

I'm pleased to report that our Q3 revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS came in ahead of our expectations, and we are on track to finish the year strong with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Today, I will start with a review of our third quarter results. Then I will discuss our key wins, AI trends and Verint's platform differentiation. And finally, I will provide a preview of our agenda for our Investor Day next week. In Q3, revenue came in at $219 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $0.65. In addition to our results coming in ahead of our expectations, we saw several positive trends driven by our AI platform innovation. First, in Q3, more than 50% of our SaaS bookings included AI-powered bots, which is a significant increase from the prior year. Second, the vast majority of our new SaaS ACV bookings came in as bundled SaaS. This significant improvement from last year reflects demand for Verint's AI, which is offered only in the Verint Cloud. We're pleased to see our bookings shifting to more bundled SaaS as brands seek to leverage AI to increase CX automation and adopt more AI from the Verint's platform. At our Investor Day next week, we'll discuss in much more detail how the Verint Platform enables brands to build a workforce of people and bots working together and the positive impact that customer AI adoption is expected to have on our growth. Let me turn to Q3 wins and pipeline growth. In Q3, we continue to have significant wins across existing customers and new logos. We received more than 30 orders in excess of $1 million TCV as large enterprises across the globe continue to expand and adopt more applications and AI for our platform. These orders included a large order in excess of $20 million TCV from a leading entertainment services company in Europe, a $6 million TCV order from a leading telecom company in North America and a $4 million TCV order from a leading health care company in the U.S. I'm pleased that each of these 3 large orders included AI-powered bots. In fact, 9 of our 10 largest bundled SaaS deals in Q3 included Verint bots. With respect to new logos, in Q3, we again added more than 100 new logos, including large brands such as CarMax, Louis Vuitton and Sky. Our objective with new logos is to have them expand in our cloud platform and purchase more bots over time. In addition to these orders, I'm pleased to report that as of the end of Q3, our 12-month SaaS pipeline increased more than 20% year-over-year. While we've seen elongated sales cycles this year due to the macroeconomic environment, the demand for CX automation is strong, and customers' growing interest in AI is reflected by our expanding SaaS pipeline. Regarding fiscal '24, we expect to finish the year with double-digit revenue growth in Q4. And later, Grant will discuss our Q4 outlook in more detail. Next week at Investor Day, we will review the completion of our SaaS transition over the last 3 years and discuss the next 3 years with our next chapter focused on CX automation leadership and growth acceleration. Here's a quick review of the agenda we plan to cover at the Investor Day. First, we will review the last 3 years following the spin of our cybersecurity business. During this period, our total revenue increased every year while executing a complex SaaS transition with large enterprise customers. Also, as part of this SaaS transition, we invested in building a highly differentiated CX automation platform, which was launched earlier this year, and we can now shift our focus to execute our next chapter. The second topic of the agenda will focus on the AI opportunity driving our next chapter over the next 3 years. We will review our CX automation platform and provide a deep dive into our AI differentiation, including the 35 AI-powered bots available in the platform today. We will discuss our go-to-market and the AI opportunity with our large customer base. Verint has a large customer base of enterprise customers, and we support 4 million agents worldwide, helping them to process 30 billion interactions annually. We believe we are well positioned to augment this 4 million agent workforce in our base with our open platform and AI-powered bots. As the market shifts to a workforce of people and bots working together, we have a significant opportunity in our large customer base and with new logos. The third topic on the agenda is the positive economic impact of increased AI adoption. Going forward, Verint is well positioned for the market shift to more bots and fewer people. Verint deploying more bot licenses with fewer agent licenses will increase our TAM overall and provide us the opportunity to accelerate SaaS revenue growth. To bring this to life, we will provide specific examples of how we monetize our AI capabilities and the resulting positive impact to our long-term financial model. In summary, we're pleased to have overachieved revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS in Q3 and are on track to finish the year with strong double-digit revenue growth in Q4. We are also encouraged by the increase in our pipeline, the addition of new logos and the increase in customer adoption of Verint bots. We're excited about our next chapter of growth driven by customer AI adoption and look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day. And now let me hand the call over to Grant. Grant?\nGrant Highlander: Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available, as Matt mentioned, in our earnings release and in the IR section of our website. Differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions, including fair value revenue adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, certain other acquisition-related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, separation-related expenses, accelerated lease costs, IT facilities and infrastructure realignment as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount and frequency from period to period. Now let me start with an overview of our Q3 results. Revenue came in at $219 million, $4 million ahead of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins came in strong at 71%, slightly above the prior year and up 180 basis points from Q2. We continue to be pleased with our gross margin expansion progress this year. The combination of our revenue overachievement and strong gross margins drove non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.65, $0.08 ahead of expectations. For Q4, at the midpoint of our annual guidance, we expect around $264 million of revenue, representing 11% year-over-year growth, another quarter of sequential gross margin expansion and about $0.99 of non-GAAP diluted EPS. As we discussed last quarter, our large sequential revenue increase in Q4 is driven by significant expected growth of our unbundled SaaS revenue stream. For full year fiscal '24, our guidance for revenue is $910 million, plus or minus 2%, and $2.65 for non-GAAP diluted EPS at the midpoint of our revenue guidance. I will discuss our guidance in more detail later. But first, I would like to provide additional color on our Q3 performance. Starting with SaaS metrics, several important leading indicators came in very positive. The first indicator is bookings mix. New SaaS ACV bookings came in at $25 million or an annual run rate of around $100 million, consistent with our expectations. Looking at the SaaS bookings mix in Q3. Nearly 90% of our new SaaS ACV bookings were for bundled SaaS compared to 65% in the prior year. Also, more than 50% of our new SaaS ACV bookings included bots, representing a large increase in customer AI adoption from the prior year. Since today our bots are only offered in the Verint Cloud, which we report as bundled SaaS revenue, we expect our bot innovation to drive growth in our bundled SaaS revenue stream going forward. The second indicator is pipeline. We continue to see strong growth in our 12-month SaaS pipeline, which was up more than 20% year-over-year driven by our open AI platform and bots. Similar to the bookings mix trend, our SaaS pipeline has also trended to bundled SaaS, which now represents nearly 90% of our SaaS pipeline and reflects the strength of our AI platform and bots. Turning to SaaS revenue. As we have discussed in the past, the revenue recognition for bundled SaaS and unbundled SaaS under ASC 606 are very different. Bundled SaaS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, whereas unbundled SaaS revenue is recognized predominantly upfront. Due to this difference in accounting treatment, unbundled SaaS revenue as well as the year-to-year growth rates can fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter. Therefore, I will discuss the unbundled and bundled revenue stream separately and also share SaaS ARR that normalizes these accounting differences. As you can see from the table on the left, bundled SaaS revenue has been trending up quarterly, and we had another quarter of sequential revenue growth in Q3. We expect bundled SaaS revenue to increase sequentially again in the fourth quarter, and for the year, we expect double-digit revenue growth in bundled SaaS. From the table on the right, you can see our unbundled SaaS revenue has fluctuated quarter-to-quarter, and we expect a significant increase in Q4 and to around $100 million of revenue. While year-over-year growth in unbundled SaaS revenue can fluctuate quarterly, for the full year, we also expect double-digit revenue growth for unbundled SaaS. Let me provide some more detail on what is driving the large sequential increase in unbundled SaaS revenue in Q4. Three years ago, we started a new program under which we offered our customers multiyear SaaS contracts that were recognized as part of our unbundled SaaS revenue. This program is ongoing, and when these contracts come up for renewal, the value is predominantly recognized upfront in the quarter in which the contract is renewed. With respect to Q4, we have a significant amount of unbundled SaaS contracts coming up for renewals. In fact, when analyzing the $48 million sequential increase in Q4 unbundled SaaS revenue, $40 million of the $48 million increase is driven by these renewals. Overall, it's important to note that quarterly fluctuations of unbundled SaaS revenue also drives quarterly fluctuations in our total SaaS revenue. Looking forward, we expect total SaaS revenue to increase around 25% in Q4, which brings our full year to about 15% year-over-year growth. Let me now turn to SaaS ARR, which is a way to look through the unbundled quarterly fluctuations. As a reminder, SaaS ARR normalizes all SaaS contracts to reflect a consistent and annualized ratable view and is becoming an important metric to understand our SaaS growth trends as customers shift to the Verint Cloud and our revenue shifts to bundled SaaS. Q3 SaaS ARR growth came in at 11% year-over-year, reflecting our new SaaS ACV bookings and solid SaaS renewal rates. We just covered the unbundled and bundled revenue streams. And now I'd like to briefly discuss the other 2 software product-related revenue streams, perpetual and support. Our perpetual revenue came in at $25 million in Q3, and as we have completed our perpetual license to SaaS transition, we expect it to remain at around $25 million in Q4 and going forward. In Q3, our support revenue continued to gradually decline as our support base shifts to SaaS over time. For Q4, we expect a decrease of approximately $1 million. At Investor Day next week, we will discuss trends for our 4 software product-related revenue streams over the next 3 years. Turning to gross profit. I am pleased to report that our non-GAAP gross margins continued to expand in the quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, to 71.3%. Year-to-date, our non-GAAP gross margin came in at 70.2%, up 100 basis points compared to the same period last year. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 73%, also up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. We believe our ability to increase gross margins reflects the strength of our AI innovation. CX automation creates significant ROI for brands as it enables them to reduce costs while at the same time elevating customer experience. Verint is able to capture a portion of these customer savings in the way we price our solutions, which benefits our gross margins. We will also discuss our improved economics due to AI adoption further at our Investor Day next week. Turning to our annual guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, for revenue, we expect $910 million, plus or minus 2%. At the midpoint of our guidance in Q4, we expect $264 million of revenue. We expect both gross margin and operating margin to increase around 100 basis points year-over-year. And for diluted EPS, we expect $2.65 at the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Regarding below-the-line assumptions for Q4, we expect interest and other expense of around $1.9 million, net income from a noncontrolling interest of around $250,000. And for the full year, we expect around a 9.5% cash tax rate and around 74 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to be in a very good financial position. Our net debt remains well under 1x last 12-month EBITDA and is further supported by our strong cash flow. I'm pleased to report that GAAP cash from operations is up 19% year-over-year through the first 9 months. Regarding our previously announced $200 million stock buyback program, to date, we have repurchased close to $150 million worth of shares. This program was announced in Q4 last year as a 2-year program, but we now expect to complete it faster than planned. And looking forward, we expect to announce a new program once the current one is completed. In summary, we are pleased to have overachieved our revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS expectations in Q3. We are encouraged by the positive leading indicators in bundled SaaS bookings and SaaS pipeline mix and are on track to finish the year strong with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Next week at our Investor Day, we will provide a deep dive into our AI differentiation, review our financial model and discuss our next chapter of growth driven by AI adoption. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham.\nJoshua Reilly: All right. Nice job on the quarter here. Maybe just starting off with a macro question. I noticed in the prepared remarks and in the press release, you didn't call out the elongated sales cycles maybe to the degree that you had in the last couple of quarters. Can you just give us a sense of has there been a shift in terms of the sales cycles or anything on the macro front that led to a little bit better net new ACV?\nDan Bodner: Yes. I think that what we're seeing is that -- no change. So elongated sales cycle that we reported at the beginning of the year have not changed, but we've adjusted our focus and our expectations to the market dynamics today. So we hope that we'll see better economic environment next year. But what's driving our growth next year is a lot of the bundled SaaS shift that is happening this year because the revenue is lagging the booking. And the shift is really the more important change that we are reporting in Q3, and it's all driven by AI. As Grant explained -- I touched on that. Our innovation, all the bots in the platform are offered only in the Verint Cloud, which drives the bundled SaaS revenue recognition. So if customers are adopting bots and -- a very important quarter, by the way, because we announced our open CCaaS platform in Q2 -- in the middle of Q2, and Q3 was our first quarter that we actually was full motion in the market with our customers. And 9 out of the 10 largest SaaS -- bundled SaaS deals came with bots. So obviously, they came in bundled SaaS because that's the way our customers will consume the AI from Verint. So that is the shift. And of course, we're booking now. It's revenue next year. And the other thing, which, again, we reported is the pipeline growth in Q3, and it's all very much -- 90% of the pipeline is bundled SaaS and AI driven. So no change in economic environment and so on, but definitely behavioral change from our customers shifting more to AI and therefore shifting more to bundled SaaS.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then if you look at this concept of fewer agent licenses and more bots going forward, is this something being discussed with customers today? And are they already kind of planning their contact center head count accordingly for the technology shift with not only your AI products but other vendors? Or is this something that you think is still a few years out from impacting contact center agent head count?\nDan Bodner: We definitely are discussing this with our customers. I personally met with many CIOs over the quarter, and this comes up in every discussion. And the question is how fast it's going to happen and not whether it's going to happen. The desire our customers have is definitely to increase CX automation because that's the only way they can elevate the customer experience and at the same time reduce cost. They just cannot continue to hire to elevate CX. And so that is definitely the center of the discussion with our customers. And the way we do that in our platform is also very differentiated because we provide an orchestration mechanism for our customers to orchestrate, kind of dial up and down how many people, how many bots they actually want to -- want to have in their workforce. And that's why we call it a platform of one workforce, people and bots working together. so next week in Investor Day, we're going to spend a lot of time demonstrating the technology, the power of the bots and also giving examples of what happened to the customer spend when they shift from people to bots and then what happened to the Verint TAM and growth opportunity. And you will see with, again, very tangible examples that it's a win-win. Our customers are going to save a lot of money. They will increase the technology spend, but the net decrease will be bigger because they will decrease much more the labor spend. So we expect -- as a vendor, we expect that as they increase the technology spend on buying more bot licenses, the impact on Verint is that the gain from these bots licenses is far greater than the loss from the agent license. And again, we'll bring that all into the economic impact and provide a model so you can model that phenomenon for the next 3 years. As -- and where we are now, just to complete the answer, I mentioned before that we currently support 4 million agents. And when we look at our renewal rates, again, good renewal rates in Q3. We have very loyal customer base. They're sticky because they like the product. They like the value that we bring to them. But when we see this renewal rate, that 4 million number has not trended down yet. So while customers are buying more bots, it's mostly to avoid more hiring, and we don't see that they are reducing their agent head count. At the same time, again, we are expecting that it's going to happen. We're expecting not only this increased capacity that bots is going to bring to the workforce is not going to only be used for reducing labor costs. It's also going to be used for increasing customer experience and increasing revenue opportunity with customers. We will discuss and, again, demonstrate all that. We're going to bring some customers and partner to talk about it next week. So that's going to be front and center to our discussion, how the industry is shifting to more AI. Verint is shifting to more bundled SaaS, and our TAM is growing because we have a much larger AI opportunity in the future.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Hugh Cunningham from Cowen.\nHugh Cunningham: From our side, let's say -- we also want to say our thoughts and prayers are with you, the members of the Verint family that are in Israel. That is still very much on the minds of everyone here. In terms of the question that was just asked, Dan, do you have a sense for your end customers, how many of them are focused on really enhancing their competitive position by improving their customer service and not so focused on reducing cost by reducing contact center head count?\nDan Bodner: Yes. Thank you for your kind note. I would say that today in the current environment, customers are, first and for all, focused on reducing their cost, their labor cost. But at the same time, they can't keep hiring to introduce better customer experience. So a lot of our customers are reporting that they know they need to hire people to elevate CX. They want to elevate CX because that's strategically important to them. But they're already spending a lot of money. They -- it's very hard to hire and retain a set of agents. So they're looking actually first to stop the bleeding, which is increasing labor cost. I personally, again, had discussions with executive level that are thinking beyond that and understand the power of customer loyalty and revenue generation over time, increasing from better customer sentiment. So I think that is -- personally, I think it's coming. But if I have to report what I see now in the market, the reason typically that currently they're buying is help me reduce my labor cost. And because the ROI is also very quick and they don't have to deploy -- if you are a 10,000-agent contact center, the way we provide you the bot consumption is you can have a volume-based consumption. So you can start with 200 agents and just look at what that does to increase capacity. And now that you've proven that in your own environment, if you want to expand, it's only Verint Cloud. It's really just changing entitlement, and we're billing them for more bot consumption. So it's very easy for them to look at, okay, I'm going to start. I'm going to stop the bleeding in terms of I can't hire people I need now to bring bots. But as I keep increasing the volume, I may want to start to use those bots for freeing up people to do more customer service and more personal relationship building with customers. I personally think it's coming, but it's not yet.\nHugh Cunningham: Okay. And then one question on the bundled/unbundled mix. It would seem to me that the motivation to switch to the Verint Cloud and enter into a bundled agreement is compelling, particularly given that's the only way to access the bots and Verint AI. What am I missing on the other side? What's keeping -- and there's this strong renewal this quarter or expected in Q4 for unbundled. Why is there strength still in the unbundled side? Why isn't everyone going to bundled?\nDan Bodner: Yes. So first, you remember that Verint is very much at the high end of the market, mid to large enterprise customers. And if you look at kind of the industry report, only 20% or under 20% of that end the segment of the market has moved to cloud, while Verint already have the majority of our customers in the cloud so -- from a revenue perspective. So the way we did that is we know that our large customers did not want to be disrupted. . Many of them have -- when you have thousands of people, it's not one contact center. It's multiple. They may be in different countries. They may deal with different technologies. So these large customers really do not have the desire to just rip and replace everything and do one big transformation into the cloud. So the way we designed our platform is a bot only working in Verint Cloud, but you don't need to bring your legacy Verint solution to the Verint Cloud. So our bots work in the cloud with your on-prem, or we have many partners that are hosting our software. So a bot in the Verint Cloud can work with a partner cloud, can work with the customer cloud. What that did is it puts us in a position, and when we look at the Q3 booking results that we have a lot of bundled SaaS booking from unbundled SaaS customers. And when it comes time to renew, they renew in unbundled because they're not ready to rip and replace what's working. But we gave them a path to consume AI in the Verint Cloud without the need to go through a big transformation. Now at some point in time, they're going to take the legacy and move it to the cloud as well. They're going to do it at their own pace. And we know that at that point, we get some uplift. But we're not dependent on that transition from customers that only when they move to the cloud, they also buy Verint bots. So we designed it that we decoupled the 2 things, and that's why we will see in Q4 many unbundled renewals. As Grant said, that's something we've been discussing now, those renewals from these customers, for the last 6 months. That's typically when we start the renewal process, and we know they're going to renew in unbundled. And some of them, when they renew in unbundled, they're going to add new capabilities, new AI capabilities in bundled SaaS.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Peter Levine from Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Great. Maybe, Grant, I think your comment was interesting to me on gross margin. You talked about you guys -- the leverage you're seeing is coming from the cost savings. So maybe just talk us through how that's getting calculated and then how you're thinking about that as you plan for next year.\nGrant Highlander: Yes. What I mentioned, Peter, was the cost savings that our customers realize the way we price, right, our SaaS business, the AI, we're able to capture that -- more of that because the ROI is very high. So that's what we see and why we look at this and the trajectory that we're on, as Dan mentioned, really driven on the back of the bundled SaaS, the bookings we did this year, driving some accelerated growth next year. And even with the scale on that, we see a path to expanded margins next year and as we continue into the future.\nPeter Levine: Your guidance of the $100 million of the unbundled SaaS in Q4, you said that's, I think, dependent on the number of deals that are coming up for renewal. Maybe talk us through where we are in that cycle, meaning 50%, 60%, 70% of those deals have closed. Or are you still expecting that, meaning how derisked is that number?\nGrant Highlander: Yes. What you're asking is what kind of visibility do we have. It seems like a big number, right? And that's the important point and one of the reasons why I wanted to share here, of that $100 million, $48 million sequentially, right, up from Q3, and that's where $40 million of that growth comes from this renewal volume that we have, whereas the $8 million of additional growth comes from new. The renewal business tends to have less risk. We tend to see that because customers already have the software deployed. We began discussions on the renewals with them 6 months in advance. We know funding typically is secured. So it's a different sales dynamic for this volume of renewals. It's really just that the timing of when these renewals have come up, more of them are here in the fourth quarter, and that's what drives a bit of that revenue dynamic. But looking at it across the year, right, has a little bit more natural dynamic, along with the SaaS ARR that we're seeing.\nPeter Levine: If I could squeeze one last one in, maybe just a follow-up from an earlier question. Is there a way that you can quantify it for us? We talked about some of the deals that pushed out of the first half into the second half. Can you quantify what you saw in Q3? Perhaps like what got pushed into Q4 and then perhaps what's getting pushed into, call it, the first half of next year?\nDan Bodner: Yes. I think that what we did after Q2 when we saw, again, Q1 slip -- deal pushed to Q2, and then there was -- we just adjusted our focus, right? We came in Q2, and we said we're going to lower the guidance for the year based on our reality of the deal cycle is just longer. So we applied that, what we saw in Q2, into Q3, and we were pretty much where we expected to be. So I think we're reading the market. There was a question before. Are things getting worse? No, they're not getting worse. I don't think they're getting better. But I think we have adjusted our view. And that's why we got $25 million ACV in Q3. We're expecting a sequential increase and then a year-over-year increase in Q4. $25 million to $30 million is kind of my range. And we think this is adjusting to the elongated sale cycles already.\nPeter Levine: Okay. And will we get any color into fiscal '25 numbers or your guidance for fiscal '25 next week?\nDan Bodner: So we will discuss the next 3 years next week, right? That's why we have Investor Day. So I think we're going to give you a lot of information about how to think about the opportunity that Verint has and how to model Verint for the next 3 years. I would say that, first, we expect next year, the revenue to grow and improve growth rates because of the bundled SaaS booking this year. So that increase in bundled SaaS this year will drive increase in revenue next year. So obviously, we discussed that. We we'll discuss the next year, the trends in detail. But the most important thing for us right now as we think about acceleration of growth rates next year and beyond is, of course, the industry that we're in is very labor intensive, and it's ripe for automation. And we are at the early stage of this, and we know that our customers are buying bots, but it's still very early stage. And I think that's going to drive the growth. So you'll see next week that the biggest growth driver for Verint next year and beyond is going to be bundled SaaS, and we -- because all our innovation has moved into bundled SaaS. We're still innovating in unbundled. It's not that we are telling our customers that they have to move away from legacy. We're absolutely giving them updates, software updates on everything that is in unbundled. But if they want to buy AI, there is no AI available from Verint in unbundled. All the AI, they have to buy in the Verint Cloud. And that's the bundled SaaS, and that's what's going to be the main driver. So let's kind of wait for next week. You'll see as we dissect each one of the revenue streams that Grant mentioned before, bundled SaaS, unbundled SaaS, support, perpetual, we'll take all these streams, and we -- today, we kind of review them for the last 3 years, and we're going to review them for the next 3 years.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: I guess maybe one, Dan, on the 4 million agents, I think you said that the majority of the -- like the revenue is in the cloud. But I'm just curious, of those 4 million agents that are using the software on a daily basis today, how many of those are accessing it via cloud deployment versus an on-premise deployment? I'm just trying to see maybe what the opportunity there is to continue pushing the actual users to the cloud side. So just I was curious, and I have a couple of follow-ups.\nDan Bodner: Yes. No, very good question. So when you look at -- we mentioned that -- more than once, actually, that we have completed the SaaS transition. So let's be clear about what that is. So in terms of new perpetual license revenue, as we said, we are at $25 million run rate this quarter. We expect it next quarter. We expect it going forward. So we have a certain amount of customers that are on-prem and will remain on-prem, and that's going to be about $100 million of revenue annually. Most of these customers, by the way, are financial services. And for a variety of reasons, they are not moving to the cloud anytime soon. So that's kind of one class of customers that are still buying in perpetual license. Okay. Everyone else is buying in a SaaS model, but we still have about $140 million that are support business, support stream right? And these customers are paying maintenance, support, and therefore, they're still on-prem. They are still -- they're not buying anything new in perpetual license, but they have not converted yet to a SaaS license. So that's $140 million. And then when you look at our bundled SaaS, it's all in Verint Cloud. And unbundled SaaS roughly, you can say about half of the unbundled running in a partner cloud, not in Verint Cloud, so that's why they are unbundled, but there are -- approximately half is running in some Verint partner cloud, and the other half is running at the customer choice, whether it's on-prem or in their choice of a cloud hosting provider. So I can't tell you exactly the numbers, but you can see that more than 50%, if you add the numbers -- and we're happy to walk you through that math. But if you have these numbers, you see that more than half of our customers are running in multi-tenant cloud somewhere, either in Verint Cloud or in a partner cloud. And the remaining are either on-prem or they are in some sort of a SaaS subscription model but not yet in the Verint Cloud or in a Verint partner cloud. Did that help you?\nSamad Samana: Yes, definitely. Appreciate that. And then maybe just thinking about the different partners that you work with. I know we talked about sales cycles by customers and kind of how those elongated. Are you seeing a change in the partners that you work with, demand from them or anything that's kind of idiosyncratic that we should be aware of from some of your larger partners that use Verint to provide WFO to their end customers? And is that something that's also -- how much visibility do you have into that for the fourth quarter?\nDan Bodner: Yes. We see, definitely, a change. All our partners want to resell Verint bots. So it's no longer WFO. I mean they're still selling WFO, which is our legacy product. But they all are being asked by the end customer, hey, I saw Verint has this thing. Can I get it? So they need to buy it in the Verint Cloud. So all our partners, almost without any -- I would say all, but there's always exceptions. But the vast majority are now reselling in the Verint Cloud or in the process of onboarding themselves to resell in the Verint Cloud so they can have access to the Verint AI. We see that as an additive business. We're not -- again, we are fully supporting our legacy products, WFO products. They're all available in the platform. But we have enhanced legacy product with bots. We've created new bots. We have 35 bots in the platform. And obviously, that's the next chapter of Verint. And our partners want to differentiate their offering, so they want to leverage what Verint can offer. And because we are an open platform, we announced open CCaaS back in June, we basically allow all partners free access to our platform so they can choose anything they want and resell. And we're definitely in the process of onboarding them. And we'll see that, that shift from unbundled booking to bundled booking is going to happen also in our partner ecosystem.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the back -- the call back over to Matthew Frankel for closing remarks.\nMatthew Frankel: Thanks, Victor, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We hope you can join us next Wednesday at our Investor Day. Have a good night.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

Today, I will start with a review of our Q2 and H1 key metrics, including bookings and revenue dynamics. Then I will review the latest innovation in our CX automation platform and our AI-powered specialized bots. Finally, I will provide a midyear update on our expectations for the second half of the year. In Q2, we delivered solid performance across key SaaS metrics including SaaS new bookings, renewals and SaaS ARR. We believe our fast momentum reflects our differentiated CX automation platform and the growing customer interest in our AI capabilities. Let me start with Q2 and H1 bookings and deal activity. In Q2, New SaaS ACV bookings came in at $26.5 million, up strongly from Q1 and consistent with our average quarterly level throughout last year. As we discussed on our prior call, in Q1, we saw elongated sales cycle due to the macroeconomic environment and approximately $11 million ACV of deals shifted to the right out of Q1 relative to our expectations. We are pleased to report that this $11 million of Q1 deals were subsequently all booked in Q2. During our last call, we also shared our expectations of more than $60 million of new SaaS ACV bookings for the first half. Our actual results came in at $42 million. Elongated sales cycles persisted in Q2 leading to over $8 million ACV of deals shifting to the right and out of Q2. Based on current forecast, we expect the majority of which to be booked in Q3. Given our experience in the first half of bookings shifting to the right in both Q1 and Q2, we're assuming economic conditions will remain the same in Q3 and Q4, resulting in approximately $10 million of bookings shifting from H2 into next year. For the year, we now see $102 million of new SaaS ACV bookings compared to our prior expectations of approximately $112 million. Grant will discuss later the expected progression of our bookings throughout the year. Now let's take a closer look at our Q2 deal activity and recent market trends. In Q2, we continue to have significant wins across existing and new logos. With respect to existing customers, we received more than 20 orders in excess of $1 million TCV as large enterprises across the globe continued to expand and adapt more applications from our platform. These orders included a $20 million TCV order from a leading financial services company in the US, a $6 million TCV order from a leading telecom company in Europe and a $6 million TCV order from one of the largest banks in the Asia Pacific region. With respect to new logos, in Q2, we again added more than 100 new logos, including large brands such as Samsung and Philip Morris. New logos customers typically start with small orders and our objective is to have them expand in our cloud platform over time. Another customer trend that is important to note is strong interest in our AI capabilities. I'm pleased to report that the majority of the new SaaS ACV booked in Q2 included one or more Verint specialized bots. We believe the market is in the early stage of the AI adoption cycle and Verint is well positioned with Verint Da Vinci AI at the core of our platform. In summary, in H1, we saw elevated sales cycles which impacted the timing of our bookings. At the same time, we saw positive trends, including increased interest in various specialized bots resulting in pipeline growth, strong renewal rates consistent with the prior year, more than 100 new logos and the average term length of new orders remaining close to two and half years. Our solid Q2 new SaaS ACV bookings combined with strong SaaS renewal rates drove SaaS ARR growth of 17% in Q2 and on a year-over-year basis, following strong SaaS ARR growth in the first quarter. We believe SaaS ARR is a very useful operating metric for management as it normalizes all SaaS contracts to reflect the consistent and annualized ratable review that is closely aligned with the SaaS cash flow generation. As a reminder, from an accounting perspective, our bundled SaaS contracts are recognized ratably while our unbundled SaaS contracts are recognized largely upfront under ASC 606 accounting standards. This difference is addressed by the SaaS ARR metric. Going forward, we intend to report SaaS ARR on a quarterly basis to help investors better understand our SaaS growth trends. Turning to platform innovation. During Q2, we held our Engage customer conference in which we showcased our latest AI innovation. Brands are looking to leverage AI to increase CX automation so they can achieve their strategic objectives of elevating customer experience and reducing labor costs. Verint open platform is designed with CX automation at the center. In Q2, we unveiled many new bots as part of the large team of specialized bots currently available in our platform. These bots are designed to augment the human workforce and deliver significant customer ROI. Customer reaction has been extremely positive. And as I mentioned earlier, the majority of the new SaaS ACV we booked in Q2 included one or more bots. With regards to pricing of bots, it's important to note that customer level of consumption is related to the volume of data processed by the bot and type of bot and not just to the size of the customer's human workforce. We believe bot consumption in our platform will increase over time given the cost of deploying the Verint bots is much lower than the cost of hiring additional people. Let's take a look at the customer ROI delivered by some of our bots. As you can see from the slide, each bot is designed to perform a single task and is focused on helping a specific human role. Customers can deploy a team of bots from the Verint platform to assist roles across all enterprise customer engagement functions. For example, a financial services company with 2,000 customer engagement employees and with an average call handle time of 5 minutes can save millions of dollars annually by deploying the team of Verint bots. In this example, the customer is deploying three bots, the wrap up bots to assist the agents with automating the after call work and potentially reducing their work by 60 seconds per call, the containment bot to significantly increase the agent capacity by having the bot respond to 30% of consumers' questions and the compliance bot to assist customer service management to automate the compliance monitoring program to significantly reduce compliance errors and avoid signs. The customer can deploy additional bots from the Verint platform for automating different tasks and to generate even greater ROI. In summary, we believe that brandsâ€™ investment in bots is more cost effective than increasing the size of the human workforce. This dynamic should drive increased consumption from our platform and increase our TAM over time. Next, I would like to discuss the trends that we see for the second half of the year. First, our perpetual to SaaS transition is progressing as planned, and we are on track to achieve 88% of our software revenue to come from recurring sources for the year. As a reminder, most of our remaining perpetual revenue comes from the financial services company with a preference for on-premise deployments, and we expect them to remain on-premises for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the revenue headwinds that we experienced from the potential transition over the last couple of years and during the current year are expected to be behind us next year. Second, regarding SaaS revenue growth, we had 16% growth in the first half and we expect growth in the second half to improve slightly, resulting in full year growth of 18% to 20% or approximately $530 million of SaaS revenue at the midpoint. Supporting our expectations for H2 SaaS revenue growth is a combination of new bookings and a significant amount of renewals scheduled in Q4 which Grant will discuss later. Turning to our outlook for total revenue, margins, adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS. For revenue, we are adjusting our annual outlook to $910 million due to the macroeconomic environment. For margin, we now expect faster growth and operating margin expansion and are pleased to be in a position to maintain our earnings outlook. For the full year, we expect $250 million of adjusted EBITDA and $2.65 of diluted EPS, reflecting mid single digit growth at the midpoint of our outlook. In summary, Verint open platform is at the center of CX automation, delivering AI power specialized bots to augment the workforce. We believe our bot consumption model is very attractive to customers. In Q2, solid new SaaS ACV bookings, combined with strong renewal rates, drove 17% growth in SaaS ARR. We now expect the current macroeconomic environment to persist in the second half, resulting in approximately $10 million of new SaaS ACV bookings shifting into next year. We're adjusting our revenue guidance and maintaining our earnings guidance driven by ongoing improvement in our gross margin. And our strong margins and cash flow generation provide us flexibility and we intend to continue executing on our previously announced stock buyback program.  Now let me turn the call over to Grant to discuss our financials in more detail. Grant?\nGrant Highlander: Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available, as Matt mentioned, in our earnings release and in the IR section of our Web site. Differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions, including fair value revenue adjustments, amortization of acquisition related intangibles, certain other acquisition-related expenses, stock based compensation expenses, separation related expenses, accelerated lease costs, IT facilities and infrastructure realignment as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount and frequency from period to period. Starting with our Q2 P&L metrics. Revenue came in at $210 million. Non-GAAP gross margins expanded to 70%, up more than 70 basis points year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $0.48. Turning to our SaaS metrics. New SaaS ACV bookings came in solid at $26.5 million, up strongly from Q1. The percentage of our software revenue that is recurring increased to 86% compared to 84% a year ago in the same period and SaaS ARR came in strong with a 17% increase year-over-year. Earlier this year, we introduced SaaS annual recurring revenue or SaaS ARR. SaaS ARR is an operating metric that represents the annualized quarterly run rate value of active or signed SaaS contracts as of the end of a period. Management uses SaaS ARR to understand the annual recurring value of customer contracts at the end of a reporting period and to monitor the growth of our recurring business as we shift to SaaS. One of the benefits of SaaS ARR is that it normalizes all SaaS contracts to reflect a consistent and annualized ratable view despite the different accounting treatments for unbundled SaaS which is recognized upfront under ASC 606 and for bundled SaaS, which is recognized ratably over the term of the contracts. The reason this is important is that our mix of unbundled SaaS and bundled SaaS bookings can vary quarter-to-quarter and impact year-over-year growth trends in SaaS revenue. This is exactly what happened in Q2. Non-GAAP SaaS revenue increased 10% year-over-year compared to our 17% increase in SaaS ARR reflecting the growth on normalized ratable basis. The new SaaS ACV booking level in Q2 this year was similar to the level we achieved in Q2 last year, However, the mix of SaaS bookings was weighted more towards bundled SaaS. To address the fact that our SaaS bookings mix can vary quarter-to-quarter, going forward, we intend to disclose SaaS ARR on a quarterly basis. Let's take a closer look at the bookings dynamics in Q2 and how it impacted our Q2 SaaS revenue. As Dan mentioned, during H1, we experienced elongated sales cycles due to the macroeconomic environment. For Q1, we previously discussed our expectations to book 27 million ACV of which 16 million closed and 11 million shifted out of Q1. These 11 million ACV worth of deals were subsequently booked in Q2. Similarly, we were expecting around 34 million ACV in Q2, of which we booked 26.5 million and over 8 million shifted out of Q2. It's important to note that the slip deals similar to Q1 were not lost and the majority of which is expected to be booked in Q3. In addition to the shift to the right, I'd also like to highlight our mix of the bookings. Of 8 million ACV we didn't book in the quarter, approximately 50% or 3.5 million were for unbundled SaaS deals. Since revenue from the unbundled SaaS deals are recognized upfront with a standard term of three years, the revenue impact from the 3.5 million deal shortfall was $11 million of revenue in Q2. As a result, the unbundled SaaS deals were the primary reason for our Q2 SaaS revenue and total revenue coming in below the prior expectations we discussed of a slight sequential increase from Q1's level. Turning to fiscal '24 guidance. We expect the shift to the right we experienced in H1 due to the macroeconomic environment to continue into H2 and believe it's prudent to adjust our outlook for new SaaS ACV bookings for the year. Our original outlook for the year was for approximately 11% new SaaS ACV growth or 112 million, and we now expect around 10 million of our bookings to shift out of the year. Our current outlook for the second half is 60 million of new SaaS ACV bookings taking the full year to 102 million, flat with last year. As a result of the bookings shift, we are adjusting our SaaS revenue outlook for the full year to a range of 18% to 20% growth. Let me give you some additional color on our annual guidance. With respect to revenue, we expect 10 million ACV bookings shift to have a $25 million impact to our revenue this year and are adjusting our revenue outlook to $910 million. While we are adjusting our revenue guidance for the year, we expect greater gross margin and operating margin expansion from accelerated improvements in our SaaS margins. As such, we are maintaining our outlook of $2.65 of diluted EPS for the year. Our diluted EPS guidance, along with our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $250 million represents 5% growth year-over-year for both metrics. We also continue to expect $190 million of non-GAAP cash from operations before onetime items. Regarding below the line assumptions, we expect interest and other expense on average of $750,000 per quarter. Net income from non-controlling interest should be about $200,000 per quarter. Our cash tax rate should be about 10% and we expect around 75 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Let me also discuss how we see the second half of the year progressing. Starting with Q3, for bookings, we expect new SaaS ACV bookings to come in at a level similar to Q2. For revenue, we expect the sequential increase from Q2 to around $215 million, driven by continued SaaS growth. And for gross margins, we expect another gradual sequential increase in Q3. Turning to Q4. For bookings, we expect new SaaS ACV bookings to grow sequentially from Q3, taking H2 to $60 million in total. For revenue, we expect to finish the year very strong with around $267 million, up $52 million sequentially from Q3. While this seems like a significant increase sequentially, most of this increase is coming from unbundled SaaS renewals being concentrated in Q4 this year. In fact, we expect approximately $55 million of renewal revenue in Q4 compared to only $15 million in Q3. And for gross margins, we expect a larger sequential increase in Q4, driven by the significant sequential revenue increase from the concentration of renewals. Next, I will discuss how the trends we are seeing this year should benefit our financial model next year. Let me provide you with some details on these benefits. Starting with revenue growth next year. We see three positive trends. First, we see a high level of interest in our latest AI and bot innovation and we expect customers to consume more from our platform over time due to the strong ROI of our solutions. Second, while sales cycles are elongating, our pipeline is growing and we believe there is pent-up demand. And third, with SaaS ARR growing strongly and perpetual revenue leveling off, the headwinds we have had from declining perpetual revenue will be largely behind us. With respect to cash flow, we expect our cash generation to grow at a double digit rate next year faster than our revenue growth. Behind this expectation is the positive impact to our cash flow from our SaaS ARR growth as well as the fact that some onetime expenditures associated with our post-COVID office realignment will be behind us. Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to be in a very good financial position. Our net debt remains well under 1 times last 12 month EBITDA and is further supported by our strong cash flow. We expect our balance sheet to get even stronger going forward as we benefit from the foundation we laid since the spin, resulting in continued improvement in margins and cash flow. And regarding our $200 million stock buyback program, to date, we have repurchased close to $100 million worth of shares and we are committed to completing our previously announced program. In summary, in Q2, we delivered solid performance across key SaaS metrics, including a 17% increase in SaaS ARR. Despite our strong SaaS momentum, we experienced some deal slippage in H1 and believe it's prudent to adjust our bookings and revenue outlook for the full year. At the same time, we expect more gross and operating margin expansion and are pleased to be in a position to maintain diluted EPS guidance and expect mid single digit growth for diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA this year. Finally, our ability to deliver innovative CX automation and drive significant customer ROI positions us to increase consumption in our platform and sustain long term growth. And before we take questions, I'd like to mention that we'll be hosting an Investor Day in December to highlight our latest innovations and review our financial model in more detail. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] and the first question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham & Company.\nRyan MacDonald: I appreciate the thorough walk-through on the updated guidance expectations. Dan, maybe you could start there and just provide a little bit more color on maybe what changed, I guess, so materially, if you will, between first and second quarter and how you're looking into the back half? And I guess, to the extent that in the conversations you're having, do you feel like we're getting to a trough point in terms of the sales cycle elongation, or what's your viewpoint on sort of the time line of how long this persists for?\nDan Bodner: So what we saw in Q1 continued in Q2. So we now assume it will continue also in Q3 and Q4. And that's basically elongated sales cycle. So we mentioned $11 million that got pushed out of Q1 to the right, and we booked them in Q2 and that was good. We were happy to see that it's not elongated multiple quarters, but we closed that shortfall in Q2, but then we had similar to the magnitude of $8 million of deals shifting to the right from Q2. And we mentioned we didn't lose them and we expect to book them later in the year, so there's a shift right. And it's basically when you look at the trends, it's basically just more [scrutiny], more approval cycles by customers. We didn't see any other trend changes. So new logos, we had more than 100 new logos in Q2 as well in Q1 and throughout last year. In terms of the average deal length very similar, about two and half years. We saw the deal sizes, so we had 20 over $1 million TCV deal. So that's for large enterprises. We did see actually the number of total deals increased 30% year-over-year on similar booking in this Q2 versus last Q2. So that suggests that there is more deals but smaller, but that could be part of the macro environment but also part of the new bots that we announced in Q2. And we mentioned that half of the deals in Q2 included one or more bots and we see that customers, as they look at AI, they tend to start small and then increase consumption over time. So that's kind of another change. But clearly, no change to new rates, no change to win ratio, it's really longer sales cycles. And then what we did today is we basically took the same trend into Q3 and Q4. We now assume that $10 million of new SaaS ACV will be pushed into next year. So we talked about $112 million this year and we now adjusted that outlook to $102 million. So not a material change in the shift to right of new SaaS ACV, but as Grant explained, at the same time, we think that a lot of the unbundled SaaS deals are being pushed and also SaaS -- what we saw is unbundled SaaS is becoming bundle SaaS. And because when we apply the 606 accounting, bundle SaaS is ratable, unbundled SaaS is upfront revenue. Obviously, as we see less unbundled SaaS, the revenue impact is more significant. So what was not a big impact on booking is creating a $25 million adjustment to our revenue outlook. But gross margin expanded as we move more to SaaS and SaaS bundle we get better gross margin. So that offset impact of the revenue adjustment and we are maintaining operating margin or EBITDA, $250 million and EPS, $265 million. So that's kind of the impact for this year. Now since you're asking when that's going to be over. So one interesting thing to note is that our pipeline for the next 12 months actually grew 20%. And that suggested while there is elongated sales cycle, there's also pent-up demand and we actually saw that in prior slowdowns by years that we had slowdowns that pipeline has grown. And when things improve in the macro environment there was an uptick also in new bookings. So we hope to see that soon, but the pipeline suggests that there is still good demand for our open platform and bots.\nRyan MacDonald: Maybe just double clicking on the growing pipeline opportunity, Dan. At the Engage conference, you had talked about some of the new product offerings. And obviously, one of the big debuts was Open CCaaS. And I think the strategy around that was to sort of help navigate more sort of at bats or shots at net. Are you seeing the desired effect from Open CCaaS yet, or what's the conversations been like since Engage?\nDan Bodner: I think that customers and partners are really excited about an open platform. I think the industry was looking for a truly open platform that allows them to focus on CX automation, which is our AI driven, elevating customer experience, reducing the labor cost. And this is exactly where open platform is. We have some very good industry coverage, industry research coverage, since then. We are getting really good momentum with partners. We just announced the Microsoft partnership recently. So we were selected by Microsoft to be not only in their marketplace, but also their sales people when they sell, they get commissions, which is obviously the most important element of being in a true partnership and our Microsoft partnership is just one more too many. But I think it's driven by open platform and our ability to work with anyone in the industry to bring value to customers and also fits very seamlessly into the customer existing environment. They can keep their existing telephony, they can keep their existing CRM vendor, and they can move forward with innovation to deploy bots and help to the workforce -- augment the workforce with AI. I think that's all very compelling to customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Peter Levine from Evercore ISI.\nPeter Levine: Maybe if I look at top of the funnel metrics, were you as successful at converting leads or adding leads at a similar level versus expectations or your plans and then second, do you feel like you have enough sales people, did you experience any sales churn? I'm just trying to get a better understanding if the folks that you do have on the front lines, are they achieving their quota? Just a general sense of do you have enough coverage, I think, in this market to kind of hit the numbers that you're putting out here for the second half?\nDan Bodner: Yes. So the leading indicator is obviously the pipeline and then the progression in the pipeline and I think the pipeline is growing but that's good but also we see elongated sales cycle. So everything takes longer and smaller deals where customers can experiment with AI is definitely quick, because they see the ROI quickly and it's not big investments. And because we have a consumption based pricing model, we also make it easier for them to sell and to buy at an initial consumption level and then increase consumption over time. So from a sales force perspective, obviously, they would rather get the big deals, which get them decommissioned. But having 100 new logos, more than half of the deal with bots consumption, that's obviously seeding the market with a lot of initial purchases that will grow over time, because when people are moving to the cloud platform, the open cloud platform, it's much easier for them to increase consumption, they don't have to go through the whole sales forces again. When it comes to the size of the workforce, the sales force, I believe we have the right size. We have people with lots of very deep relationship with customers at go many year back and they know customers personally. They also understand the customer challenges. They understand what customers are trying to solve. So we're not just trying to sell technology, we really bring to our customers' ROI driven solutions. In terms of the sales commissions, we pay commissions based on obviously new bookings, but also renewals and renewals are very important for achieving our goals. And we also pay sales people accelerators for selling more innovation to our customers. So while we just reduced our booking expectations by $10 million for the year, $10 million ACV for the year. But as sales people are more successfully selling cloud and innovation, they can get accelerators. And I hope that we'll see many people coming to our [present] cloud next year as they achieve quarters.\nPeter Levine: Maybe as a follow-up to, I think, Ryan's first question was, given that you don't really have visibility into when we'll trough out here. So one is, what are your hiring plans into the second half and then what are your initial hiring plans as you think about fiscal '25?\nDan Bodner: So right now, our guidance assumes flat operating expenses in Q2 and Q4, so similar to Q1. So we have no hiring plans, and we're going to maintain the level of expense that we have now. And I think in this environment, it's positioned us to really focus on getting the sales people we have today to build the pipeline. And as I said before, to push more innovation into our customer base and new logos. And as soon as we see signs that this pent-up demand that we see in our pipeline growth is starting to materialize then we obviously can change their view and resume hiring. But right now, for the remainder of the year, our guidance assumed that things will remain the same.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mason Marin from Jefferies.\nMason Marin: So I wanted to focus on your existing customer base with regards to guidance. Are you seeing existing customers reduce licenses or are you seeing any change in the [churn] based on the macro environment? Any color there would be appreciated.\nDan Bodner: The only change is -- the two changes that we see are [indiscernible] longer as they bring more executive into the approval cycle and there's definitely growing interest in bots, and we launched the bots in June in our Engage Customer Conference. I think some of the analysts and investors, you were there and you saw the really excitement, customers were thrilled with the bots. We have now about 30-plus bots in our platform, we will introduce 15 more this year and we expect to introduce about 30 more next year. So very, very rapid innovation. And that's because DaVinci AI is the core of the platform and it helps us to bring not just Verint AI, but any commercial gene AI to bring it into the platform, train it quickly on data and release new bots that augment the workforce to do different tasks. So that's clearly exciting customers. So on one hand, elongated sales cycle, on the other hand, more interest in bots and growing pipeline. So no, we didnâ€™t change -- no change in renewals, our renewals were strong in Q2. Gross renewals, low to mid-90s and more than 100% NRR. So renewal rates didn't change. We saw big deals. We saw same term length, close to two and half years. So no different in behavior, no really difference in behavior other than the elongated sales cycle and the bot interest.\nMason Marin: And then on the deals that have been pushed out, are you seeing any clustering in a particular vertical or industry perhaps?\nDan Bodner: Not at all. It's very random. Some things that we start two weeks and we already got some Q2 deals in Q3, so some of the deals are pushed just by a little other gets pushed by month. No rules, no industry pattern. It's really company by company and just generally cautious approach to IT spending.\nMason Marin: Last one from me is you've talked a lot about your AI bots. How should we think about that impacting on like a per customer ARPU basis, any rule of thumb regarding like an ARPU uplift that you're seeing from customers that are adopting?\nDan Bodner: So we talked last quarter on a potential 10x uplift that we see in our customer base, and that's based on analyzing our top customers. This clearly -- the spend on labor is very large in customer engagement. We talked about $2 trillion labor spend annually and bots -- bots are really good at doing just one thing, right? Each bot is automating one task and it's very easy for customers to kind of compare the price of their bots to the savings that they create. And obviously, they can deploy a large team of bots and save more than just on one task, but that makes them very easy to deploy from the platform, both are deployed embedded in workflow, so there's no disruption to people while they're doing their normal work, they're getting help from bot. So it's a very, very good way for customers to start to increase automation or what we call CX automation, customer experience, elevation and automation. At the same time, it's very easy. So we think, and that's what we mentioned that we'll see increase in bot consumption in our base. We have new numbers to start small and our goal is that they will increase bot consumption over time. And that creates a whole new TAM that didn't really exist before AI that Verint is leading the way in terms of bringing AI to the fingertips of the agents.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matthew Frankel for closing remarks.\nMatthew Frankel: Thanks, [Justin]. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Of course, as always, feel free to reach out to me with any follow-up questions you have. And we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Have a good night.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

I'm pleased with our first quarter non-GAAP revenue and diluted EPS coming ahead of our guidance. Our results were driven by strong SaaS momentum in our differentiated open platform. Today, I will start with a review of our Q1 results, including our strong gross margin expansion, driven by our SaaS revenue growth. Next, I will review our open platform and how we leverage the latest AI innovations to deliver CX automation and significant customer ROI. Finally, I will review our guidance for this year, and we'll discuss the expected benefits to our financial model upon completion of our SaaS transition next year. These benefits include accelerating revenue growth, higher gross margins, and incremental cash generation. Let me start with reviewing our first quarter results. Non-GAAP Q1 revenue came in at $217 million ahead of our guidance and gross margin came in close to 70%, a strong 200 bps increase year-over-year. Our gross margin expansion is being driven by our ongoing shift to SaaS. Non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $0.53, also ahead of our guidance. Last revenue, which is our key growth driver, increased approximately 24% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We are on track to complete our SaaS transition next year which we define as the milestone where 90% of our software revenue comes from recurring sources. In Q1, we made very good progress towards this goal with this metric reaching 87%, up significantly from Q1 of last year. In summary, we are pleased with our revenue and profitability in Q1 and reiterate our guidance for the year. Next, I would like to discuss significant wins and market dynamics. During Q1, we received orders from some of the world's leading brands such as the global bank Macquarie, Auto company, Toyota and telecom provider, Deutsche Telekom. In terms of new logos, we continue to win many new customers and in Q1, we again added more than 100 new logos, including the Bank of England and retailer Casey's General Stores. As discussed on the last earnings call, in the current environment, we are seeing elevated sales cycles, especially with very large deals. While customers may take longer to make decisions, their need to elevate CX and increased automation is very high. Our open platform delivers significant customer value and we are winning deals in the current environment based on our ability to clearly demonstrate customer ROI. Let's take a closer look at three recent large 7and 8-digit SaaS wins. These wins were all driven by our open platform and our CX automation innovation resulting in significant ROI for our customers. The first order for $21 million TCV works from a leading U.S.-based financial services company. This customer expanded its relationship with Verint with an 8-digit order by adding new applications from our open platform. The second order for $6 million TCV was from a leading telecom company in Europe. This customer merged with another large company and decided to adopt Verint's Solution across the combined entity. The third order for $3 million TCV was from a large international bank. This customer expanded its usage of the Verint open platform to address additional CX automation opportunities. In this environment, the timing of closing deals can vary by customer. Looking at our pipeline across all types of deals, we expect to drive double-digit growth for new SaaS ACV for the year. Let me now turn to the capabilities of the Verint's open platform designed to increase CX automation and deliver significant customer ROI. Customers have been reporting that CF Automation has become a strategic objective. We estimate that industry already employs 50 million workers globally at an annual cost of $2 trillion and improving CX levels with incremental hiring is not sustainable anymore. Verint's are ready to adopt AI that can help them elevate CX and increase efficiencies to reduce cost. Clearly, the industry needs AI and Verint's developed the platform that translates AI technology into tangible business outcomes. We do this by placing AI at the fingertips of the workforce of humans and bots. Here are some examples that explain how Verint inject AI to all parts of the contact center operations. Verint's automates interaction responses to improve self-service and reduce the number of calls coming into the contact center. Verint's automates workforce planning by increasing focusing accuracy. Where it automates the compliance process across all channels to ensure adherence. Verint's automates the knowledge search to increase agent efficiency and reduce customer all time. And Verint's automate quality assessment and coaching to increase the effectiveness of the workforce. There are many more automation capabilities available today in the Verint open platform. And with the increased pace of AI innovation, we are launching more CX automation at an even faster pace, which I will explain next. There are three key attributes that make the Verint open platform highly differentiated. First, at the core of the platform is our open engagement data hub. For more than two decades, we've been helping customers capture comprehensive engagement data across all channels and types of interactions between consumers and brands. This vast and unique data set is critical to continuously train AI models and make them accurate and effective. Open Data Hub is a key differentiation of the Verint platform. Second, we also architected at the core of the platform, the Verint's opened Da Vinci AI. Da Vinci is completely open and takes advantage of the latest AI models available commercially, such as GPT and others. This unique design enables Verint to remain flexible and future-proof by quickly embracing the latest generic AI innovations for Verint or any other vendor. And third, our platform includes many best-of-breed applications that leverages Da Vinci and the Data Hub, placing AI at the fingertips of the workforce to deliver tangible business outcomes. Regarding AI monetization, customers today can purchase from the open platform based on a CX automation consumption model. Over time, as AI adoption increases, we expect our customers will naturally increase their CX automation consumption, and this is expected to benefit both our customers as well as our financial results. Turning to our guidance for the current year fiscal â€˜24. We expect another year of strong SaaS revenue growth and margin expansion with adjusted EBITDA growing faster than revenue, and we are maintaining our annual guidance. As we manage the business this year to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth, we continue to progress towards the completion of our SaaS transition. And I would like to discuss the expected benefits to our financial model next year. We expect the completion of the SaaS transition next year to positively impact our top line growth in two ways. First, when you look at the last year's results and this year's guidance, we have headwinds from the decline in nonrecurring revenue of approximately 3% each year. Next year, with the planned completion of our SaaS transition, we expect these headwinds to be largely eliminated. And this is expected to translate to incremental revenue growth next year. Second, over the last several years, we have focused on the Verint's SaaS transition and at the same time, our customers focused on their own SaaS migration. We are now beginning to shift our focus to driving customer expansion initiatives, helping our customers achieve their strategic objectives related to increased CX automation. This should have a positive impact on our revenue growth over time. Completing the SaaS transition should not only improve our overall revenue growth rate. It is also expected to have a positive impact on margins and cash flow generation. Similar to most companies going through a SaaS transition, we expect our cash generation to improve. This year, we expect cash flow operations, excluding nonrecurring items to grow at a similar rate to revenue. And next year, we expect it to grow faster than revenue. We look forward to completing the transition next year and to benefiting from these tailwinds to our financial model. As you know, our transition to SaaS has taken several years given the nature of our large enterprise customer base. As a reminder, our customer base, including over 85% of the Fortune 100 including all 10 of the top 10 banks, nine of the top 9 insurance companies and eight of the top 10 health care companies. In summary, CX Automation is a strategic objective as brands are spending $2 trillion annually on labor costs and hiring more people to elevate customer experience is not sustainable. Talking brands closed this engagement capacity gap by addressing their very large labor cost with CX Automation is a significant long-term opportunity for Verint. We've architectured the Open Data Hub and Verint Da Vinci AI at the core of the platform. And now with the faster pace of AI innovation, Verint is increasing our differentiation as the leader in CX automation. Our fast position is during the end of the journey, and we look forward to the financial and operational benefits we expect next year. And finally, where strong margins and a strong balance sheet, which provides us flexibility as we continue to execute our previously announced stock buyback program. Now let me turn the call over to Grant to discuss our financials in more detail. Grant?\nGrant Highlander: Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available, as Matt mentioned, in our earnings release and in the IR section of our website. Differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions, including fair value revenue adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, certain other acquisition-related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, separation-related expenses, accelerated lease costs, IT facilities and infrastructure realignment, as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount and frequency from period to period. For certain metrics, it also includes adjustments related to foreign exchange rates. Starting with our Q1 results. Non-GAAP revenue came in at $217 million ahead of our guidance. Non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $0.53, also ahead of our guidance. SaaS revenue increased approximately 24% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. There are two main drivers of our SaaS revenue growth, new customer deployments and conversions. In Q1, the growth from both drivers was relatively evenly split. For the year, we project around two-third of our growth to come from new customer deployments and one-third from conversions similar to prior years. And the percentage of our software revenue coming from recurring sources increased to 87%, up approximately 400 basis points year-over-year. Turning to gross margins. Our recurring revenue generates much higher gross margins than our nonrecurring revenue, and our recurring revenue growth has been driving total gross margin expansion. In Q1, I am pleased to report that gross margin increased to nearly 70%, a more than 200 basis point increase year-over-year. Our recurring revenue gross margin has already improved to the mid to high-70% range due to the scale of our SaaS operations. And going forward, as our revenue mix continues to shift towards SaaS we expect total gross margin to continue to move higher. Turning to guidance. We are pleased with our revenue and profitability metrics in Q1, and we are maintaining our guidance for the year. Let me discuss how we see the year progressing. On a non-GAAP basis, for revenue, we expect $935 million, plus or minus 2%, with sequential increases in revenue every quarter. We expect a slight increase in Q2, a larger increase in Q3 and to finish the year with our usual strong fourth quarter. Looking at the year, we expect revenue growth to be higher in the second half of the year, given the easier year-over-year compares. For new SaaS ACV, we expect double-digit growth this year. So far in the year, new SaaS ACV was $16 million in Q1 and $12 million in May. This brings our last 12-month new SaaS ACV bookings through May to $103 million reflecting 7% growth over the same period in the prior year. With respect to the progression of the current fiscal year, through May, we have $28 million closed out of the more than $50 million projected in the first half and an additional $60 million in the second half of the year. I would like to note that with ratable revenue recognition, the exact timing of bookings does not significantly impact revenue in the current financial period. We expect our gross margins to increase sequentially and for the full-year to increase around 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect OpEx to increase modestly in Q2 from Q1 levels and we expect to maintain that level of spend for the rest of the year as we manage expenses in the current economic environment. And for the full-year, we expect our operating margins to expand a bit more than 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase 7% for the year to a bit more than $250 million through a combination of strong SaaS revenue growth, gross margin expansion and expense controls. And for diluted EPS, we expect $2.65 at the midpoint of our revenue guidance with sequential increases in EPS, consistent with our sequential increase in revenue. Regarding the below-the-line assumptions, we expect interest and other expense on average of $750,000 per quarter. Net income from noncontrolling interest should be about $200,000 per quarter. Our cash tax rate should be about 10%, and we expect around 75 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Looking beyond this year, as Dan discussed earlier, we believe the completion of our SaaS transition will have positive benefits to our financial model next year. Let me provide you with some additional details on these benefits. Starting with revenue. As we have shifted to SaaS, our nonrecurring revenue has steadily been declining. Looking at last year's results and this year's guidance, nonrecurring revenue represents a headwind to total revenue growth in an amount of about 3 points each year, and we believe this headwind will be largely behind us next year. In addition, as Dan mentioned earlier, we believe we will see a benefit to our top line from shifting our focus from SaaS migration to platform and AI adoption. With respect to cash flow, similar to most companies going through a SaaS transition we expect our cash generation to start to grow faster. To put this in perspective, last year, we generated $190 million of cash from operations, excluding nonrecurring items. This year, we expect this to grow in line with revenue. And next year, we expect to grow faster than revenue at a double-digit rate. I'd like to highlight that our free cash flow acceleration should be even faster as the onetime investments over the last few years related to the spin and our office space will be behind us next year. Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to be in a very good financial position. Our net debt remains well under 1 times last 12-month EBITDA and is further supported by our strong cash flow. We expect our balance sheet to get even stronger going forward as we benefit from the foundation we laid since the spin, resulting in continued improvement in margins and cash flow. And regarding our previously announced $200 million stock buyback program, to date, we have repurchased close to $90 million worth of shares. In summary, our non-GAAP revenue and diluted EPS came in ahead of guidance, driven by our differentiated open platform. We expect our platform to drive strong SaaS growth and margin expansion for the full-year and we are maintaining our guidance for the current year. Looking ahead to next year, we expect our financial model to further benefit from the planned completion of our SaaS transition. These benefits include accelerating revenue growth, higher gross margins, and incremental cash generation. Finally, our ability to deliver innovative CX Automation and drive significant customer ROI, position us well for sustained long-term growth. Before taking questions, I'd like to highlight several investor relations initiatives. First, we've updated the financial dashboard on our IR website to help investors focus on the critical metrics associated with the end of our SaaS transition. Second, we'll be updating sell-side analysts on our AI-powered platform at our ENGAGE conference next week where we'll showcase our latest innovations. And third, in the fall, we'll be hosting an Investor Day for both sell-side analysts and investors to demonstrate our AI innovation and discuss the benefits of completing our SaaS transition in more detail. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Q - Ryan MacDonald Thanks for taking my questions and appreciate all the color, especially in the, sort of, the post SaaS transition world here for Verint. And that's where I really wanted to start, Dan. Can you kind of double-click on that a bit more? And you talk a bit about the benefits of sort of what the completion of the SaaS transition will bring in. In particular, you talked about sort of the second revenue driver of acceleration around sort of the AI platform adoption will help further that acceleration of growth. Can you just maybe talk a bit more about where that comes from? Or how investors should think about that coming in?\nDan Bodner: Yes, sure. Thank you. So we're almost approaching the midpoint of the year. So it's a good time to start to talk about next year and really excited to finish the cloud transition as we discussed before. So there are immediate benefits that we will see next year and there are more benefits over time. And I'll talk about AI separately, I think it's a very important topic. But then you start kind of with a review of why this such transition completion is good. And based on the detailed analysis that we did for our customer base, we believe that next year, the headwind for nonrecurring decline is coming to an end. And just this will result in a couple of points of incremental growth even if the rest of the business performs exactly the same way it is this year. So that's one thing. Then the second thing is we also see an increase -- the customer base shifting to running in the Verint cloud. And these customers are already Saas, but for now, they host bearing solutions in other clouds. It could be in part cloud or their own cloud. So there are clear benefits for these customers to shift to the Verint cloud for faster innovation and especially AI and quick time to value. And we expect minimum of 2 times uplift if these customers just move like to like. But of course, many of them are expanding, and we expect up to 10 times if they expand in the platform. And they don't have to spend at the time of the conversion, they can definitely expand on the conversion and then over time. But it's a great uplift opportunity for us from this customer base. Finally, as we complete the first transition, we're going to focus on helping them expand. We -- you asked what are we going to do? So it's a little early, but we're starting actually this year, so we will be fully ready next year. And as we kind of shift the focus to operational -- operationalizing the completion. It's more marketing campaigns on the base. It's the pricing models. I'll discuss maybe later that the consumption models, and obviously, the sales force that we'll be focusing more on helping customers doing this conversion and expansion. So there's some uplift that comes from this conversion and of course, expanding as these customers are looking to increase consumption of CX Automation, and that drives a very strong ROI. Now in addition to what we expect to revenue accelerating, we definitely expect gross margin to continue to expand. We discussed many times that our recurring revenue has higher gross margin in the mid- to high 70s. So the shift to more recurring continue to benefit gross margin, and we saw some very nice expansion in Q1. And Grant discussed also the improvement to our cash flow generation, which is acceleration in cash from operation, but also acceleration in free cash flow, because some of the one-time investments we did after the spin are also going to come to an end. So free cash flow is going to accelerate even faster next year. So from a big picture perspective, when you think about this SaaS transition, the economic value of a SaaS deal is far greater than perpetual over time. And our customers benefit from faster innovation in the Verint cloud and of course, we benefit from higher economic value. And because we have very large customers, and they moved to SaaS slowly. Our transition took several years, but for the same reason, we expect that we'll continue to renew and expand with these customers as they consume more AI from the platform and increase the spend with Verint. And again, the expansion opportunity can result in a 10 times uplift. So we see very tangible benefits that we expect next year and even more so over time.\nRyan MacDonald: Appreciate the color there. And then maybe as I think about, we've got to get a lot of questions from investors, obviously, with generative AI and the potential disruption it can have on the context center broadly. But can you talk about why these investments in AI are a good thing for Verint over time?\nDan Bodner: Sure. So AI plays a role in many industries, but clearly, it plays a very big role in the customer engagement. And we discussed many times, we estimate that brands spent $2 trillion on labor, it's not sustainable. So our customers are really excited by AI. And I can tell you that in Q1, we estimate that more than half of the deals we did in Q1 had some elements of AI already included. But as much as customers are excited, they also want to make sure that it's creating ROI, and it's not just technology. So what Verint's does is really we're exclusively focused on CX Automation. That's what we do. And that means that we -- our mission is to transform AI technology into business outcomes. And that's what customers want because they don't want to buy AI. They want to buy the business outcomes that create the ROI. So why are we going to benefit from AI. So first, there's a simple reason. We have an open platform and it's differentiated and best in the market in its ability to place AI innovation at the fingertips of the workforce. And we also -- I can talk about how we monetize AI and through a consumption model, and that's good for our customers and also good for Verint's. But let me start with the first point, why we have the best platform in the market today. So our platform is open, and it's open in all dimensions. We have the Open Da Vinci and Open Da Vinci takes advantage of commercial AI models in addition to our own proprietary models. So I can tell you specifically with GPT, we already have GPT 3.5 in production with customers. We have GPT 4.0 in our research labs, and we will be introducing new use cases because there's some additional capabilities in 4 that specifically around leveraging visual imports and significantly larger comps that will create new use cases that Verint will commercialize. I believe that when it comes to GPT, open source generative AI this year is equally, if not more disruptive than GPT 4 and we have basically -- we have every and any open source AI for many vendors as part of Da Vinci and it's completely open. So Da Vinci is architected at the core of the platform, and I'm not aware any other vendor in the market that actually have this architecture. So it's undifferentiated. And why it's important is because -- at the core of the platform, we also have the Data Hub. And the platform can train all the AI models, whether it's proprietary or third-party, they train on real engagement data 24/7. And data is critical. It's critical for the accuracy and effectiveness of AI. We know that when AI doesn't work, it's very frustrating to people, and that's it useless. So training is a key component. And for over two decades, we help our customers capture data and our data is completely open. So we bring together data from many data silos across the customer ecosystem. And again, no other vendor has a data hub architecture at the core with such vast and diversified data sets that is available for AI training. So that you can see we have Da Vinci it's open. We have data that is vast and trained all the time. But then the last component, you need a platform to transform technology into business outcomes. And the platform offers many best-of-breed applications and it's completely open to allow customers to start anywhere. So they can use any piece of workflow that they want and inject AI into that workflow. And the result of this is you bring the AI to the fingertips of the workforce, so they can use it and it will augment the work and increased -- obviously increased their productivity. And let me stop here and see if any follow-up questions.\nRyan MacDonald: Yes. No, that's helpful. And then maybe just one more from me. You mentioned earlier about the potential for a 2 times uplift when a customer moves on is hosted on the Verint Cloud versus another cloud. How are you thinking about in terms of strategy, incentivizing sales force, incentivizing customers to sort of drive that shift going into next year? Thanks.\nDan Bodner: Yes. So the way we designed the SaaS transition because we have large customers, and they have preferences for cloud. And we wanted to make sure that they move to SaaS and regardless of which cloud they run. And that was the first part of our SaaS transition. But over time, our customers realized that running in the Verint allows us to introduce innovation faster than when they run in different clouds just because we put new software in our cloud every 2 weeks. So the AI increased the pace of innovation and obviously, cloud is the best vehicle to drive innovation faster for quick and to value. In fact, Da Vinci is only available in the Verint cloud today. So that's a big incentive for our customers to leverage the latest Da Vinci capabilities. And again, now that we're getting to 90% of software revenue recurring and the sub position will be behind us next year we're increasing the focus also internally in terms of programs that we offer customers and pricing consumption models and, of course, sales force incentives. This will be introduced later in the year, but I think it will start to really kick off next year and beyond that.\nRyan MacDonald: Excellent. I appreciate the color. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Shaul Eyal from TD Inc. Cowen. Your line is now open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you so much. Good afternoon, guys. Apologies for some background noises here. So Dan it would appear that you, Grant, Alan, the team definitely seeing kind of the -- whatever is left in the SaaS transition. And I'm getting e-mails asking me as we start thinking about your next year's revenue guidance, and again, I don't want to front run the Analyst Day that you alluded to later on this year, but is there any chance that we're going to be heading back to a double-digit growth territory. Is that a possibility at all?\nDan Bodner: It's too soon to discuss next year guidance also, because the economic environment this year. And that's why we discussed it in terms of incremental growth that we see next year to this year. Of course, if the overall economy improves, the increase of growth will be on top of a faster foundational growth, let's call it, but whether it's next year or the year after, we stated the goal that based on an open platform, Da Vinci and data at the core and driving more ROI for customers we definitely are targeting double-digit revenue growth over time. We're already at 27% EBITDA margin this year. So we talk about continued margin expansion. So we are targeting to increase revenue growth and at the same time, expand margins. And I think for -- I mentioned before, a 10 times opportunity for our customers, if they adopt more AI across the platform. And I think if you want to think about the growth potential here or the TAM, maybe the best thing is to discuss an ROI example. So let's take, for example, a customer that employs 2,500 employees, customer service employees. This customer will spend $100 million a year on labor, that's 2,500 times 40,000 a year. So it's a big spend. And Verint customers have thousands of agents, and we have customers that have tens of thousands of agents. We are very strong in the mid to high end of the market, so our customers have lots of labor spend. So now let's assume that this customer purchased three Verint specialized bots, and I'll explain what the specialized bots is. But they only pursue three for a price of $2 million ACV. So they're committing to spend $2 million here. So these three specialized bots can help the workforce to increase productivity. So let's say one specialized bots is an expert in automating interaction wrap-up. They're not replacing humans. They're not better than humans, but they're really good at doing one thing. The interaction wrap up, and therefore, they save 30 seconds from each interaction. The second specialized bot from Verint is an expert in surfacing contextual knowledge. So that saved another 30 seconds from the interaction. And the third special bot is only good at real-time agent coaching based on assessing where coaching is needed and real-time assisting the agent, and that saves another 30 seconds. So now that's 90 second less, and if the average interaction duration is five minutes, this customer workforce productivity just increased by 30% using three specialized bots. And this could be a $20 million ROI for this customer, $20 million savings. So our customers was motivated to consume more. And when we think about what's the potential, what's the TAM, what is Verint after when we came up with this CX Automation and we did the spin, and we said that's what we're going to focus that's really the mission that we have to help customers to create this productivity by creating specialized bots, and we have dozens of specialist bots each focused on one element of the customer engagement workflow. So they are not useful for superhumans, but they make the agent into a superhuman because they're there to help them do something. And when you free the agent time, our customers now can decide either they want to cut costs or they want to improve the customer experience or what we see many customers are now thinking to use that extra time to make the customer service people into salespeople and leverage the fact that they had a very good interaction with the customer to sell them something. So there's a lot of different ways that this automation can benefit customers. That's how I think about the long-term opportunity.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. Thank you for that elaborated reply. And just maybe a quick question also. I know that you mentioned really maybe a handful of elongated maybe some bills that are were pushed a little bit by elongated sales cycle. But has any deal canceled? Or was it just timing issue and all the transactions that might have been postponed. How many of those have already come back?\nDan Bodner: So we mentioned in Q4 some slip deals. I can say that the majority came in Q1, and we expect over the year, some were pushed more than just a few months. In Q1, we had a couple of deals that actually closed shortly after Q1. The $21 million deals that I mentioned before, that's an interesting story because the deal was fully negotiated and ready to sign way before quarter end. And it's a $21 million deal, so many signatories and the signature process just took long and ended shortly after quarter end. But it's a ratable revenue cognition. So it really doesn't affect anything. And Other than the -- which period to report it, it doesn't really impact the revenue at all. So we see customers are taking longer with the final approvals, especially when it gets to the CFO. But eventually, they recognize that they need technology and they cannot spend money on labor and we can help them to create a good ROI, and thatâ€™s get the deal over the goal line.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. Thank you so much. Good job.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Dan, maybe the first one for you. Just on the pricing model for AI. Can you remind us, are you currently pricing Da Vinci? Is it a platform fee plus some interaction model? Is it based on the number of seats, just how should we think about the current model? And how are you thinking about that model evolving over time?\nDan Bodner: Yes. So today, we give customers an option to purchase the specialist bots, either by the users that they help or by the consumption. So how many times they have been called to help. I can say that some customers like to go by consumption because they can start small, and they want to make sure that they only increase automation consumption when it's really working. So that's what's appealing to some customers. Other customers prefer to just pay a fixed price per user, because they want to kind of cap their cost of automation. But when you think about this, it's not that we have one special bots per user. I envision that over time, each user will have three, four, five or 10 different bots, helping them doing different things, right? The wrap up work that agent does manually is replaced with a bot that we can only do wrap up. Searching for knowledge is completely different bots. Coaching the agent, it's a different bot. So they can pay by user, but then they'll have to pay for each bot that they use or they can prefer the consumption. The way they actually buy, they don't buy bots. They buy workflows, right? We have been delivering workflows to our customers for many, many years that help them to run their business processes and the bots are actually injected into the workflow. So the agent doesn't have to stop what they're doing and say, oh, I'm going to call it bot. Everything is big actually automatically built into the way they work today. Well, when they come to do a certain task, they -- if the bots was purchased by the customer, that bots shows up and just do the work. So instead of summarizing the call, which can take 30 seconds, sometimes a minute, the bots, if this purchase come in, they see the summary, they approve it. It takes them five, 10 seconds, and they go to continue to take the next interaction. So itâ€™s -- we're very flexible because we know our customers like AI, but they also want to make sure that this works in their own environment. And that's why we see that as they get more confident, they will increase consumption over time.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then, Grant, maybe just a follow-up question for you on the SaaS revenue guidance. I understand the comps get easier in the back half. I guess as you sit here today, how much of that -- how much visibility do you have into that acceleration that's required in the back half of the year to hit the full-year target and how much I guess, how much new business you have to book in order to get to those targets, how much variance is there?\nGrant Highlander: Sure. Thanks for the -- so we do see an uptick in the second-half growth rates and for SaaS, it's really driven by a couple of things that we've talked about in the past. One is the new and expansion deals, right? And that's related to the new bookings and the others related to conversions. First quarter, we saw a 50-50 split between those in terms of driving that SaaS revenue growth. Second happened for the full-year. We expect it to be more closer -- closely related to two-third of that overall SaaS revenue in the second-half will come from the new and expansions and about one-third from the conversion activity. So in terms of the visibility and uptick, a portion of that is outside of the conversions and getting some of the uplift Dan mentioned. It's also related to some of the new bookings that we have and I gave some commentary on what we see, the $50 million -- greater than $50 million in new SaaS ACV first-half and a slightly more in the second-half, that $60 million and we have good visibility on the pipeline, right, coverage to achieve that. And then there's one other dynamic that we have that drives a little bit faster acceleration in the second-half for growth rates and that's related to some renewal volumes that we have coming up in the second-half of the year, and that's really driven by the nature of our SaaS transition. We established our transition program three years ago. We had a number of customer contracts we signed at that time, and those renewals are coming up in the second-half of this year. So that combination of dynamics is what drives a little bit of the uptick that you'll see first-half to second-half.\nSamad Samana: Great, really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it.\nGrant Highlander: You bet. Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Peter Levine from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nPeter Levine: Hey, thanks guys for taking my question here. Maybe, Grant, just to piggy back of you back off of what you just said with the renewals. Maybe could you give us an initial read for the contracts that are you seeing those contracts take longer to close? What percent -- are you seeing those conversion rates or renewal rates at all, stay steady, improved, decrease? Just give us a sense of, kind of, where you think those renewals will come in, in the second-half?\nGrant Highlander: Yes. Renewals, we're not seeing much change at all on those contracts. I think what Dan had highlighted and where we're seeing more of the elongated sales cycle, are really on the newer deals or the expansion related because that's where customers need to go and find the additional funding. On the renewals, it's pretty well baked in and for the funding environment. So we've seen very good steady progression on that over time.\nPeter Levine: Now in terms of contract terms we heard from others that reported this quarter, like they're not getting through years anymore. So is that what you're seeing from both new and existing contracts where it's typically maybe you're seeing more one-year deals versus three-year deals?\nGrant Highlander: What we've seen -- so our new deals typically are three years. And then for the renewal opportunities that we have out there, it's really a mix. It's not a standard three year. If anything, we've actually seen a slight tick up in the term length that we have with customers, in many cases, starting to renew a little bit longer. And part of that is the understanding and the messaging that Dan has highlighted of the ability to get additional value from Verint's platform. So locking in gives them a little bit of pricing benefits without as much of uplift but they have that ability to get a lot more innovation from our platform in doing so.\nPeter Levine: Perfect. Sorry, Dan, go ahead.\nDan Bodner: What I see in that regard, customer on one hand, the natural trend is -- I don't want to renew longer because I don't know what's going to happen. But once they realize that they actually have -- we're not locking them in because the platform is probably open, and they can do whatever they want with their Telephony, CRM system. They can buy any application. We -- and they can leverage the platform in any way, as Grant said, we don't see that as an issue. And at the same time, we see customers that really want to lock the price for three years, because of inflation, and they have a price guarantee if they lock the price for three years. So net-net, yes, no impact on Verint from now.\nPeter Levine: And just one last quick one. I don't think I put it on the call, but just a kind of a macro update. If you look at your full-year guide, what assumptions are you baking in? Are you assuming the environment gets worse, stays kind of where it is today. Just give us a sense of you think about the full-year guide, what your assumptions are around the background impacting your ability to close deals? Thank you.\nDan Bodner: Yes. No assumption in improvement of economic environment. There's no reason for us to make that assumption. So we expect the same. We talked about the new deals, the [Indiscernible] ACV, 50 in H1, and we have 28 through May and then 60 in H2, which is as Grant just said, we have the pipeline coverage. But in addition, the assumptions this year is that we'll have the gross margin expansion, because we continue to shift with good SaaS growth, recurring revenue growth, we continue to shift to higher gross margin. And we will -- we assume that the gross margin improvement throughout the year. And in our OpEx level, we had 106 in Q1. We planned very small sequential increases because we, again, want to be cautious in this environment. So the net-net is 7% EBITDA growth. That's over $250 million EBITDA this year, 20% margin and that's really our focus here. And while we're doing that, we want to complete the SaaS transition and focus on helping customers adopt. So those three things are the main strategic initiatives that are driving in the company this year.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matthew Frankel for closing remarks.\nMatthew Frankel: Thanks, Justin, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. As always, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Have a good night. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
