For those of you following along the slides, I am on slide three, entitled Overview. We are very pleased to report a strong financial and operating performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our team did an outstanding job with consistent execution of our strategy, as we continue to win market share. While the retail environment remains challenging, as consumers are being more selective in their discretionary spending, we worked very hard to offer compelling product mix that meets this demand. Additionally, our superior customer service, a best-in-class omnichannel shopping experience, strong vendor relationships, in-store placement and underserved markets our distinct competitive advantages that allowed us to continue to gain market share. Our sales were supported by a strong back-to-school season, which occurred in the first month of the third quarter. Footwear sales, continue to be the key driver of our sales, especially for premium brands. We are fortunate to have strong vendor relationships that support our ability to deliver the latest products that appeal to our fashion conscious consumers. During the quarter, we benefited from a more regular schedule of new product launches, which received a very positive response from our brand loyal customers. As announced earlier in the quarter, we launched our Nike Connected Partnership which connects Hibbett and Nike’s loyalty programs. We are very excited about this new benefit for our customers, what it means for our joint businesses. Bill will provide some additional detail in his remarks. In addition to our solid sales performance. We are pleased with the progress we have made with respect to improved expense management and disciplined inventory controls, Bob will cover this in greater detail in his remarks. We also continue to make the necessary investments in our business to enhance the customer experience, both in our stores and our expanding omnichannel platform. We believe our store expansion strategy will be a key driver to our continued growth and we are still on track to meet our goal of adding approximately 40 net new stores this year. We are pleased with the trends in our business and look forward to the fourth quarter and a successful holiday sales season in line with our expectations. We are excited about additional new product launches around the holidays, which will boost sales and we are confident we have sufficient inventory to support these events and our premium Footwear sales. I would like to emphasize, in short, we are investing in our business model for the long-term and continue to take market share. Before turning the call over to Jared, I would like to thank our 11,000 team members across the organization for their dedication and hard work and support to our customers in a relatively challenging environment. We have a passionate and dedicated workforce operating more than 1,150 stores, our omnichannel platform, our logistics facilities and our store support center. They distinguish our brand in the marketplace with outstanding support that continues to drive customer loyalty and extends our market reach. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Jared.\nJared Briskin: Thank you, Mike. Good morning. Please turn to slide four entitled Merchandising. The third quarter opened with a strong conclusion to the back-to-school season. Footwear remained our strongest category during the quarter with a low single-digit comp sales increase. Results in Footwear were driven by strength in basketball, lifestyle and running silhouettes. A favorable launch calendar also enables these positive results. Apparel and Team Sports were both negative for the quarter down in the low teens. Seasonal categories were strong during the back-to-school season, but cooled in the latter part of the quarter due to the warm and dry weather patterns. Apparel also continues to be affected by promotional activity due to elevated inventory levels in the market. While Apparel was a challenge overall, socks and backpacks were strong performers in the back-to-school period. Specific to Footwear and Apparel, the men’s and kids business was down low-single digits, while women’s was positive mid-single digits. Men’s and kids were both down low-single digits, driven by a low-teen decrease in Apparel, Footwear results in both men’s and kids were positive low single-digits. Women’s was up mid-single digits, driven by a mid-teens increase in Footwear offset by weak Apparel results. We continue to make progress on reducing our inventory, inventory levels declined slightly in the third quarter versus the second quarter, as well as year-over-year. We continue to expect the promotional environment through the fourth quarter, our targeted promotional efforts, as well as support from our key brand partners will help us achieve our goals for inventory reduction. Our expectations remain unchanged. We are on track to deliver a mid-teens year-over-year inventory decline at year end. I will now hand the call over to Bob to cover our financial results.\nBob Volke: Thank you, Jared, and good morning. Please refer to slides five entitled Q3 Fiscal 2024 Results. As a reminder, all financial results are reported on a consolidated basis, that includes both the Hibbett and City Gear brands. Total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 0.3% to $431.9 million from $433.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Overall comp sales decreased 2.7% versus the prior year third quarter. Brick and mortar comp sales declined 5.4% compared to the prior year’s third quarter, while e-commerce sales increased 12.6% compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. E-commerce sales accounted for 17% of net sales during the current quarter, compared to 15% in the prior year third quarter. Gross margin was 33.9% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 34.3% in the third quarter of last year. This approximate 40-basis-point decline was driven primarily by lower average product margin, which is approximately 130 basis points below the same period last year. This unfavorable product margin performance is attributed to higher promotional activity across both Footwear and Apparel categories. Higher store occupancy costs, mainly due to deleverage from the slightly lower sales volume, accounted for approximately 40 basis points of the overall decline in gross margin versus the prior year period. Partially offsetting the unfavorable product margin occupancy impacts was an improvement in freight shipping shrink and logistics costs, as a percent of sales. SG&A expenses were 23% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23.9% of net sales for the third quarter of last year. This approximate 90-basis-point decrease is primarily the result of our continued focus on expense management, including improved efficiency of store labor and strategic reductions in discretionary expense categories, such as professional fees and advertising. These initiatives have more than offset the impacts of inflation on wages, goods and services and deleverage from slightly lower sales volume. Depreciation and amortization in the current quarter of fiscal 2024 increased approximately $1.4 million in comparison to the same period last year, reflecting increased capital investment on store development, technology initiatives and various infrastructure projects over the last three fiscal years. We generated $34.5 million of operating income or 8% of net sales in the third quarter this year, compared to $34.2 million or 7.9% of net sales in the prior year’s third quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $2.5 for this year’s third quarter, compared to $1.94 per share in the comparable period of fiscal 2023. We ended the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with $29.6 million of available cash and cash equivalents on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and $96.9 million of debt outstanding on our $160 million unsecured line of credit. Net inventory at the end of the third quarter was $398.1 million, a 1.7% decrease from the prior year’s third quarter and down 5.4% from the beginning of the fiscal year. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were $11.5 million with approximately 75% attributed to store development projects, including new stores remodels, relocations and new signage. We opened 10 net new stores in the third quarter, bringing the store base to 1,158 in 36 states. We repurchased just over 700,000 shares under our share repurchase plan in the third quarter at a total cost of $32 million. We also paid a recurring quarterly dividend during the quarter in the amount of $0.25 per eligible common share for a total outflow of approximately $3.1 million. Now turn to slide six, year-to-date results. Total net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 1% to $1.26 billion, while year-to-date comparable sales have decreased 1.9% versus the first nine months of last year. Brick and mortar comp sales declined 2.7% and e-commerce comp sales increased 2.9% compared to the prior year. Year-to-date, gross margin was 33.5% of net sales versus 35.3% of net sales last year. This is an approximate 180-basis-point decline. Please note the unfavorable gross margin various on a year-over-year basis has improved since the end of the second quarter, we closed Q2 trailing prior year gross margin by 240 basis points. The decline in year-to-date, gross margin continues to be driven by lower average product margin of approximately 240 basis points. This was 300 basis points at the end of Q2 and higher store occupancy costs of approximately 40 basis points. On the positive side, we experienced year-over-year improvements in freight shipping and logistics cost as a percent of net sales. SG&A expenses were 23% of net sales for the first nine months, compared to 23.2% in the same period last year. The approximate decrease of 20 basis points is primarily the result of lower spend in advertising and professional fees. We have generated $96.4 million of operating income or 7.6% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to $117.7 million or 9.4% of net sales in the prior year’s first nine months. Net income for the first nine months of this year was $72.3 million or $6 -- or $5.66 per diluted share, compared with $89.6 million or $6.71 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal year were $37.2 million, predominantly related to store initiatives, including new store openings, relocations, expansions, remodels and technology upgrades. I will now turn the call over to Bill Quinn to discuss consumer insights.\nBill Quinn: Thank you, Bob. Starting with our loyalty program. I am happy to report continued growth. In Q3, our loyalty sales grew single digits. This was primarily driven by more members shopping and average ticket growth, higher average unit retail drove the growth in average ticket and increased member shopping was driven by continued engagement from our existing members. We continue to make improvements to our loyalty program, we are especially excited to announce the launch of our Connected Partnership, connecting Hibbett to Nike’s loyalty program. This transformative partnership will further distinguish the Hibbett retail experience, customers can now sign up to be a Connected member either in-store or online, also both new and existing customers can sign up to be a Connected member. Benefits of the program includes exclusive shopping experiences, personalized content and early access to Nike and Jordan member products, integrating the Hibbett rewards and Nike membership will improve the ways we engage and delight our members across all omnichannel touch points. We heavily marketed the launch of the program and we also have a variety of ongoing digital and in-store marketing campaigns. Customers have been very receptive to the program and we are pleased with the results we are seeing. Turning to our e-commerce business, in Q3 sales increased 12.6% versus last year, e-commerce represented approximately 17% of total sales for the quarter versus last year’s 15%. We have seen a propensity of customers return to online shopping, as indicated by our most recent surveys in Q3 sales data. Traffic, conversion and average ticket all increased in Q3 driven primarily by Footwear, as well as a strong back-to-school sale. Entering Q4, we are continuing to keep a pulse on our customers are feeling, customers continue to have elevated concerns around the economic conditions, including inflation. On a positive note, concerns around resuming student loan payments have declined since the summer, also our customers intend to purchase more this holiday season than last year. I will now hand the call back to Bob to discuss our guidance.\nBob Volke: All right. We are moving forward to slide eight. The business outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 remains challenging to predict, inflation has continued to have a broad impact not only on consumer sentiment and spending patterns. But has also contributed to increases in our operating costs in the form of wages and prices we pay for various goods and services. Higher interest rates have driven up the cost of borrowing for us and may also be affecting discretionary purchase decisions for those consumers with variable rate loans or credit card debt. We also expect the heavier promotional environment to continue for the near term. All these factors contribute to an uncertain retail environment as we enter the traditional holiday shopping period. Despite these headwinds and uncertainties, our strong third quarter results coupled with our fourth quarter outlook that remains consistent with the assumptions supporting our previous guidance has resulted in adjustment of several elements of our fiscal 2024 full year guidance. The most prominent change is increase in our diluted EPS range. We are now anticipating diluted EPS for the full year to be between $8 to $8.30. This is up from $7 to $7.75 range that we provided for earlier. Consistent with prior guidance, net sales for the full year, including the impact of the 53rd week are anticipated to be flat to up approximately 2% compared to our fiscal 2023 results. The 53rd week is expected to be approximately 1% of full year sales, approximately 52% of our total sales will be recognized in the second half of the fiscal year. Total comparable sales are still expected to decline in the low single-digit range for the full year. Full year brick and mortar comparable sales are also still anticipated to be in the negative low single-digit range. However, we now expect full year e-commerce revenue to be flat to up low-single digits. We are anticipating a slight mix shift toward e-commerce that we saw in the third quarter will continue through the holiday season. We expect our net new store count to be approximately 40 units for the year. This is at the low end of the previous range as delays in external approval and longer lead times on inspections and permitting have pushed back some of our construction schedules. We anticipate the aggressive promotional environment to continue in the near-term. Projected full year gross margin remains unchanged from previous guidance at approximately 33.9% to 34% of net sales. We have lowered the anticipated, SG&A range as a percent of net sales to 23.1% to 23.3%, down from 23.3% to 23.5%, which was provided in our previous guidance. We are actively managing discretionary expenses and continue to focus on identifying efficiencies throughout the organization, which are currently helping us offset inflationary pressures, most notably in labor and benefits. Operating margin for the year is expected to be in the range of 7.6% to 8% of net sales, up from previous guidance of 7.4% to 7.8% of net sales. Operating profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter benefits from higher sales volume. Although, the 53rd week is not considered a significant driver of incremental operating profit due to the low sales volume projected for that week. We still expect to carry debt throughout the remainder of the year, although we have lowered the interest expense range as a percent of sales. Consistent with previous commentary, we anticipate the borrowings will moderate as inventory levels decline throughout and after the holiday season. As noted previously, diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $8 to 8.30, up from previous guidance of $7 to $7.75. This range assumes an estimated full year tax rate of approximately 23.1% to 23.3%, down slightly from prior guidance and an estimated year end weighted average diluted share count of approximately $12.6 million also down slightly from prior guidance. We continue to project capital expenditures in the range of $60 million to $70 million, with the largest allocation focused on new store growth, remodels, relocations, new store signage and improving the consumer experience. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to include share repurchases and recurring quarterly dividends, in addition to the capital expenditures noted above. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mitch Kummetz from Seaport Research. Please proceed.\nMitch Kummetz: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just hoping to get a better sense of consumer spending pattern, it sounds like you guys had a good back-to-school, I am guessing maybe things slowed a bit in September and October, it sounds like from a seasonal standpoint, there were some challenges. And then there was a comment made about the holiday spending outlook that you expect your consumer to spend more for this holiday. Then lastly, can you just maybe elaborate on some of that, I don’t know if you can kind of give us the months for the quarter, but just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of kind of how the consumer’s purchasing sort of peak versus non-peak period?\nJared Briskin: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, Mitch. Its Jared. I will start and then Bill and likely Ben involve in the conversation as well. I think what we saw obviously the peak of back-to-school was really strong for us and we saw that at the tail end of the second quarter into the third quarter, in the month of August. So really pleased with the back-to-school results, really across all categories and we are really excited around what the seasonal Apparel was showing us during the back-to-school. Unfortunately, as we got outside of back-to-school, outside of that peak, thing definitely slowed down some with the biggest impact coming in Apparel and we do believe that is a direct result of the weather patterns not being favorable with regard to warmer temperatures year-over-year and lack of wet weather. So we feel great again in back-to-school, little bit challenged towards the end of the quarter in Apparel, as I have said, but Footwear was fairly consistent through the quarter. Felt really good about Footwear and in particular the launch cadence throughout the quarter, we felt really strong. So, Bill?\nBill Quinn: Yeah. Good morning, Mitch. So to answer your question around how customers are feeling, they do have elevated financial concerns, but at the same time, they do plan on spending more during the holidays in particular on Footwear, as well as online. When we dig further into our survey results, it’s pretty interesting. We found that, basically the younger you are the more positive you feel, so Gen Z, as well as the millennials are definitely bullish and intend to spend more versus the older population, which is good for us, because Gen Z and millennials are our core customers. Also for those people that have financial challenges, they are planning to make trade-offs. So cutting back things like eating out, entertainment to find a retail spending. Also some customers plan to lean more to credit during the holiday.\nMike Longo: Yeah.\nMitch Kummetz: Okay. Thank you.\nMike Longo: Go ahead, Jared.\nJared Briskin: Go ahead, Michael.\nMike Longo: Obviously, Jared, and Bill summed it up pretty well. We had a really nice strong back-to-school selling season, impacts our business in a big way. The seasonal patterns, Jared mentioned too impacts our outerwear sales. But I feel good about our position of inventory going into the holiday season. Our peak season been strong and really look forward to seeing what Christmas selling season brings in store.\nMitch Kummetz: All right. Thanks. I will go ahead and re-queue.\nMike Longo: Thank you, Mitch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Williams Trading. Please proceed.\nSam Poser: Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much. Happy Thanksgiving almost. A question on the inventory, Jared you mentioned, it would be down mid-teens at the end of the year, which would get it about as clean from a pure dollar perspective as we have seen it in some sometimes. The promotional activity that you are seeing that’s impacting the gross margin once your inventory gets to that level, regardless of what’s going on out in the marketplace. I mean do you anticipate a significant improvement in your gross margin and I call it, your -- let’s say, your product margin going into fiscal 2025?\nMike Longo: Yeah. Good morning, Sam. Happy Thanksgiving as well. Yeah. So it’s really, it’s two-part approach. I mean, obviously, we are hyper focused on the level of inventory and we believe we will get to a more optimal level by the end of the year with regard to the total level of inventory. But we do still have some pressures with regards to content. So we are hyper focused on the content. We will continue with targeted promotions around the content to try and get that our healthiest level with regard to what we are showing to the consumer as we go forward. So likely, there still be a few challenges as we head into next year with regard to the content that we believe will get that resolved pretty quickly as we head into next year.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then, secondly, the new Nike part -- how much is the new Nike partnership and what sounds like better allocations impacting -- where does that impact more in stores or online. And then, secondly, you commented that the launch calendar was very favorable in Q3. How does that look going in -- within Q, give us any indication, I know it’s early on sort of what 4Q looks like to-date that’s cross your fingers and get an answer question?\nJared Briskin: We will answer that.\nMike Longo: Well, we are not going to answer quarter-to-date, but we do feel good about the launch calendar in the fourth quarter and the support that we have regarding allocations in the fourth quarter. Specific to Nike Connected. It’s really will affect both channels as we go forward. Bill will give a little more color here in a moment on what we did across all the channels from a Connected membership perspective. But specific to the product, there is additional focus around our business with regard to access points that will both impact brick and mortar, as well as digital. We will certainly have an enhanced profile of vendor direct offering that will affect primarily the digital space. And then just a general focus of our business being elevated around additional support of inventory in the most coveted products. So we feel really good about where we stand. Our relationship and partnership has been incredible. And this will help to reinforce that as we continue to put forth a great experience for consumers. Bill?\nBill Quinn: Yeah. Sam, to give you a little bit more on Connected. So it will definitely help with acquisition and retention for both channels. So what we are seeing is definitely some good sign-up rates for the Connected program, which is positive. We are doing Connected Member events drive engagement at our stores, as well as a member-only products. So we are talking with our customers, customers are happening. The basic gist of it is, it’s more that the program is more valuable, because you are getting more than just Hibbett and as a result of that we are starting to see new customer sign-ups increasing overall.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And just one last thing, can you give us any variation between what you are seeing out Hibbett and City Gear.\nMike Longo: It’s pretty consistent, Sam. I think, obviously, both of our brands are highly focused on the fashion consumers. So it’s been pretty consistent.\nSam Poser: Thanks very much. Continue the success.\nMike Longo: Thank you.\nBill Quinn: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cristina Fernandez from Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.\nCristina Fernandez: Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the better results. I wanted to ask about the channel mix you are seeing, particularly with the strong performance in e-commerce. Do you think it’s more due to the product launches or consumers looking for promotions, which had been more, I guess, significant online? Well, first sort of, yeah, the trends in e-commerce? And then, I guess, what initiatives are you taking to drive more traffic in stores, which has been a challenge for a few quarters now? Thank you.\nJared Briskin: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Cristina. It’s Jared. I will start. I think from a channel perspective, obviously we are hyper focused on both channels. Our ability to gain additional access and inventory levels and a lot of the most coveted products is certainly driving additional engagement from a digital perspective. So we believe a lot of that is due to the strength of our Footwear business and less about the promotional activity from a digital perspective. Bill, I think, I have hinted to you, I am sure you will have some commentary around this.\nBill Quinn: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So the -- as Jared said, the strength of the Footwear business really drove that e-commerce penetration for the quarter. We believe that will continue just based on what we are looking at here for Q4. So we did raise guidance for digital to flat-to-single-digit positive. As far as driving store traffic and what we are doing around that, our biggest acquisition and retention vehicle is our loyalty program and we are doubling down on that. We have a variety of initiatives to continue improving that program, as well as Connected, obviously. We are also doing a lot around launches, particularly in-store to drive higher sell-throughs and more traffic around that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Kleber from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.\nJustin Kleber: Hi, guys. This is Justin Kleber. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the partnership with Nike.\nMike Longo: Hi.\nJustin Kleber: I want to ask a question on margin, kind of two parts. Just first on the product margin decline of 130 basis points in the quarter. Can you parse that out maybe a bit at least directionally between Apparel and Footwear and kind of what’s really driving that decline? And then just longer term, your new operating margin outlook for this year 7.6% to 8%. I guess, barring some economic shock, do you guys feel this level is kind of the new baseline now for operating margins and we can either hold or maybe you can expand as we look out into the future? Thank you.\nJared Briskin: Hey, Justin. It’s Jared. Good morning. Thank you. I will start with regard to the product, it’s really across both Footwear and Apparel. I mean, as we said, we are making great progress. Secondly, the team has done an incredible job of managing the inventory, getting the inventory lower, and as we have said, we feel great about where do you expect the plans in the four quarter. But we still have some work to do to get to an optimal level of content. So that’s across both categories. I would also say that typically the seasonal products early in the season tends to be very margin rich. So some of the challenges around seasonal Apparel in the latter part of the quarter didn’t help us as much as we might have expected with regard to margin from a product standpoint. Bob.\nBob Volke: Good morning, Justin. As far as, obviously, we are not giving any guidance into the future at this point beyond the current fiscal year. But I think, directionally we are, obviously, looking to continue to try to slowly improve performance overtime, nothing’s a complete linear equation. So we are going to see some ebb and flow in margin. We will see some ebb and flow in SG&A. But I think, again, we have kind of -- we have talked about this before about established kind of new baseline. We do believe that this is a number we can again be comfortable with probably into the near-term. But again, we will provide more formal guidance, obviously, into the fiscal 2025 after we finish the current year.\nJustin Kleber: All right, guys. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving everyone.\nMike Longo: Thanks. Thanksgiving to you.\nJared Briskin: Thanks. Same to you.\nMike Longo: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the technical difficulties. We will move onto our next question, which is coming from the line of Alex Perry with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Perry: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess, first, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the guidance and sort of the 4Q implied guidance, it looks like the comp guidance and gross margin guidance remains unchanged. Is that just conservatism or you talked about the launch calendar being strong or are you seeing more cautious consumer behavior that led to not raising the guide? Thanks.\nJared Briskin: Hey, Alex. Good morning. Jared, I will start. Yeah. I mean, I think, all the above, right? I think there’s still a lot of market uncertainty, there certain -- uncertainty around the consumer. We still think there is elevated inventory levels in the market, which will likely lead to a pretty heavily promotional environment, the weather at the tail end of the third quarter, obviously, didn’t help that. So I think all of the above. There’s still lot of uncertainty in the market and even though we are confident that our plans and certainly confident about the investments we have made in the business, there is still lot of uncertainty in the market.\nAlex Perry: That’s really helpful. And then just a follow-up. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the secondary brand performance? I know that had been a bit softer earlier in the year. Are there any call outs to strong brands outside of Nike and Jordan are continuing to help the business?\nJared Briskin: Yeah. I mean we have a really broad brand portfolio. As you know, we typically don’t talk specifically about a lot of brands on this call. But, historically, we tend to have a pretty significant brand churn. There are some of our secondary brands that are doing a nice job from a pipeline perspective of innovation or at least the newness and innovation in our business doesn’t necessarily mean the technology that can mean something that hasn’t been in the market that’s brought back and put forth in front of the consumers. So some brands are doing a little better with regard to the innovation pipeline and they are succeeding and others are still unfortunately very slow with regard to innovation that’s continuing have challenges. So as brands improve throughout next year and into the future with regard to that newness and innovation profile, we would expect better performance out of our secondary brands.\nAlex Perry: Perfect. And then just my last one, could you just talk a little bit more about Apparel inventories, are there still overages that need to be worked through, and I guess, on the seasonal product, does that improved a bit now that the weather has turned? Thanks.\nJared Briskin: Yeah. Hey, Alex. Jared again, we feel really good about where our Apparel inventory is. Obviously, that was a category that we really put -- started putting solutions against first. So no real significant challenges with regard to Apparel. Obviously, there’s a lot of business to be done in the fourth quarter and a lot of uncertainty out there. So we will see how that all initiatives up. But again, we feel good about where the inventory is expected to land and really good about where we expected to have content as we get into next year.\nAlex Perry: Perfect. That’s really helpful. Best of luck for this holiday season.\nMike Longo: Thank you so much.\nJared Briskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lawrence with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Lawrence: Great. Thank you. Congrats guys. And Mike, would you talk about a little bit about expenses. I mean, obviously, great strides there and I know you are doing a lot. What inning are we in before you would wonder if you are cutting into muscle on the labor side, whatever. Just some thoughts on how much room you have on the expense cuts?\nMike Longo: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Ben will come in after me on this one I think. To set the table on the question, if you will recall several quarters ago we spoke about the fact that sales had accelerated over the past few years and we drug some costs inadvertently as is normal. We drive some costs into our current structure. We went a little too far on a handful of things whether that was a handful of people or handful of projects or particular systems that we didn’t need and so we have been -- we began a systematic process to review those about 12 months ago and that has borne fruit and we are pretty proud of that. We don’t think that we are anywhere near cutting into the muscle. We -- I would permit more, we are taking the savings and reapplying them to the consumer experience, which has the virtuous circle of improving cost, improving our efficiency and effectiveness, and speed with which we can serve the customer. Ben?\nBen Knighten: Yeah, Mike. Appreciate it, John. It’s Ben Knighten. There’s a little bit rare in retail when you are able to kind of gain both efficiency while increasing your effectiveness, and to your point, not cutting into that muscle. Our big move here to the mobile platform is kind of enabled us to do both, putting those tools in our associates hands has made them even more productive and enable them to do their job better with the customer. It’s kind of elevated that customer experience and the associated experience, I might add to Mike’s point that combined with our sales culture out there has led to really results improved SG&A for Q3 specifically. Just really proud kind of state that of all the hard work done from our associates and being able to do that and really elevating that customer experience in-store and online.\nJohn Lawrence: Yeah. Thanks. And last one for me is, just taking that thought going forward, you get back to more normal weather patterns, et cetera. The Apparel business and there’s no reason with a reasonable positive comp that you can leverage that even further?\nMike Longo: Yeah. We think so. And so to answer your first question, we think we are in the mid-innings. Just know that we are not going to take all that to the bottomline. We are again, we will reiterate, reinvesting much of those savings into the business model, so that we can continue into the future, having that positive consumer experience online and at retail. So thanks for the question.\nJohn Lawrence: Great. Thanks guys. Happy holidays.\nMike Longo: Thank you.\nJared Briskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mitch Kummetz with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMitch Kummetz: Yeah. I just had a quick follow-up. On the women’s business, I just want to have a better understanding there, because that was up in the quarter. I think you said it Footwear was up mid-teens. Can you say how much of your business is women’s, can you elaborate on the strength of that business, particularly in Footwear, like how much of it is that, maybe there’s just a better underlying product trend in women’s or that you are better positioned to take market share there. And like what do you see the runway for your women’s going forward, like do you think there is continued opportunity for outperformance of that side of the business?\nJared Briskin: Yeah. Hey, Mitch. Good morning again. Jared. Yeah. I think, look, if we really go back and look at our history and the history of this industry, women’s really hasn’t been focused on. We took a significant approach in 2020 when we went through our merchandising reorganization that put a focus on each gender. We felt like women’s have the broadest opportunity followed by kids, since that point, we have more than tripled the women’s business. So feel great about what we are doing in women’s. Our -- we have a hyper focused team specifically on women’s that we have added resources to and we are getting great focus from our brand partners on the women’s business. The women’s business very, very fast and trying to forward for us and our team has done an exceptional job on following those trends and getting the right levels of inventory and getting support from the vendors and we still see it as a big growth vehicle for us.\nMitch Kummetz: All right. Thanks again.\nMike Longo: Thank you.\nJared Briskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please proceed with your question.\nSam Poser: Since I am the last one. I got a handful. The inventory cleanup that you are doing that you talked about, Jared, to get the quality better. Is this something where you are sort of being more aggressive during the holiday sort of to take care of it, well, the ducks are flying kind of situation?\nJared Briskin: Yeah. I think it’s really the approach is to remain targeted with regard to promotions. I mean we don’t -- we are not in a position where we need to do this mass fire sale with regard to inventory, we are targeting the promotions in the right places and we will do our best to move through as much as we can here in the fourth quarter, put us in the best position as we go forward, but there certainly will be a balance around, how much we want to do versus how much will hold over into next year and then how much of the support we can get from our partners with regard to relief fund inventory. So multi-pronged approach. Again, I feel like the team is executing really well against that and we have made major strides.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then, secondly, you called out Nike as doing quite well on the Footwear side. Can -- do you -- is there any positive call out on the Apparel side of the business. You would say, this category brand whatever that is doing well in a very difficult situation?\nMike Longo: Yeah. I’d say, right now our biggest driving category Apparel side is denim, denim has been a significant focus for us for a number of years. We continue to expand our presence in denim along with adding additional cat -- additional products within the woven categories, both of those have been exceptional, continue to be a focus for us and we believe continue to be a differentiator in our business.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then, Bob, on the share count. The currently -- the fourth quarter share count, what number should we be using and then I just wanted to know about where you -- where everybody sort of the loyalty program as well as far as new members and percent of business. I might have missed that earlier?\nBob Volke: Yeah. The end of the year share count is approximately 12.6 million diluted shares.\nSam Poser: I understand. But Q4 is going to be significantly lower than that. Is that like 11.9 million, is that, I mean, that’s to get you to just under 12.6 million, is that…\nBob Volke: Yeah. We don’t…\nSam Poser: I mean, that’s…\nBob Volke: We don’t give the specific guidance for the quarter. Just you can do the math on the difference.\nSam Poser: Thank you. And then on the loyalty.\nMike Longo: Yeah. Loyalty we saw growth in total active members that have anyone who has purchased within the last 12 months’ year-to-year. So we are continuing to see good growth there. Loyalty is over 60% net sales and as far as the break down, most of the growth in loyalty and a quarter it was driven by existing members shopping. When we look at new customers that number was slightly down, but the sales from new customers was actually up and that’s because of an increase in average ticket.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much and happy holidays again.\nMike Longo: Thank you.\nJared Briskin: Thanks, Sam. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I’d like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional closing remarks.\nMike Longo: Well, thank you so much for your time and attention today. We appreciate it. We are pretty proud of the quarter, more to come and look going into this holiday season, I will leave you with the message, you don’t have enough sneakers or denim yet. So we will see you, your family and friends out in the stores this holiday season. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time."

I'll now turn the call over to Mike Longo.\nMike Longo: Good morning and welcome to the Hibbett, Inc. Q2 earnings call. For those of you following along with the slides. I’m on the slide three entitled overview. Now we're pleased to report a solid performance for the second quarter, while the current environment remains challenging, we're proud of our ability to execute our strategy and reiterate our guidance for the year. Our consumers are still dealing with higher costs for essential items like food, utilities, and gas, and thus have reduced some of their discretionary spending. While our sales have been affected by this, we've continued to focus on the aspects of our business that we can control. While we have a proven business model that has served us well through all economic cycles, and we remain focused on our competitive advantages, which I’ll remind you are a compelling product mix, a superior level of customer service, a best-in-class omnichannel shopping experience, in our strategic positioning in underserved markets. Our footwear business remained consistent in this environment, and we're encouraged by our customer's response to our product line. Coupled with our kickoff to the back to school season in Q2, we landed sales in the range of our guidance for the quarter. With the support of our major brand partners, we remain focused on providing a compelling quality product assortment that appeals to our customers and meets current more selective demand trends. We believe in this environment is more important than ever to continue to invest in our business model, and those investments mostly focus on the consumer experience at retail, and online, and the supporting infrastructure that helps deliver a consistent high level of customer service. Of course, one of the more important business model investments we make is in our store footprint. We're committed to our previously stated goal to add 40 to 50 net new stores in fiscal ‘24. Above all, we will continue to build upon the strength of the Hibbett and City Gear brands and further enhance our strong competitive position in our current and future markets. In short, we're investing in our business model for the long term and believe that we will continue to take market share. Before turning the call over to Jared, I'd like to thank our 11,000 team members across the organization for their hard work and support to our customers, whether working in one of our more than 1,100 stores in 36 states, our omnichannel platform or the logistics facilities or our store support center they’re the face of Hibbett and provide consistent, superior service that is synonymous with our brand. And as I've said to the team yesterday, this is my favorite team sport and I wouldn't trade this team with anyone else's. Thank you. I'll turn the call over to Jared.\nJared Briskin: Thank you, Mike. Good morning. Please turn to slide four entitled Merchandising. The second quarter concluded with a strong start to the back-to-school season. Footwear remained our strongest category during the quarter, but did decline low-single-digits versus the prior year. Results in footwear were challenged early in the quarter, due to performance of secondary brands and franchises, as well as an unfavorable launch calendar. The results in the latter part of the quarter were much improved due to an improved launch cadence and the start of back-to-school. Footwear results continue to be driven by product launches, as well as the basketball, lifestyle and casual categories. In addition, we continue to see an improving trend in our running business. Apparel and Team Sports were both negative for the quarter with apparel down in the high-teens. Apparel continues to be affected by promotional activity, due to elevated inventory levels in the market, while apparel was a challenge overall, early results of seasonal product, as well as back-to-school accessories such as socks and backpacks are encouraging. Specific to Footwear apparel, the men's and kids business was down, while women's was positive. The challenges in the launch calendar and secondary franchises had a broader effect on the men's and kids businesses. Men's and kids were both down high-single-digits. Women's was up mid-single digits, driven by strong footwear results. Inventory levels declined slightly in the second quarter versus the first quarter and we've made some progress, although we do expect the continued promotional environment and a much more selective consumer at least through the third quarter as we work to reduce our inventory. These promotional efforts as well as support from our key brand partners will help us to achieve our goals for inventory reduction, while year-over-year inventory compares, will continue to be volatile due to the challenges that affected the supply chain during fiscal 2023, our expectations remain the same for our inventory levels as we expect year-over-year declines in the second-half of the year. I’ll now hand it over to Bob to cover our financial results.\nBob Volke: Thanks, Jared, and good morning. We are now moving on to slide five. As a reminder, all financial results are reported on a consolidated basis, that includes both the Hibbett and City Gear brands. Total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 4.6% to $374.9 million from $392.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal ‘23. Overall comp sales decreased 7.3% versus the prior year's second quarter. Brick-and-mortar comp sales declined 7.7%, compared to the prior year second quarter, while e-commerce sales decreased 5.2%, compared to the same period of the prior year. E-commerce sales accounted for 15.1% of net sales during the current quarter, compared to 15.2% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Gross margin was 32.8% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal ’24, compared with 34.4% in the second quarter of last year. This approximate 160 basis point decline was driven primarily by lower average product margin, which is approximately 215 basis points below the same period last year. This unfavorable product margin performance is attributed to higher promotional activity across both footwear and apparel categories. Higher store occupancy costs, mainly due to deleverage from lower sales volume, accounted for approximately 100 basis points of decline in gross margin versus the prior year period, partially offsetting the unfavorable product margin and occupancy impacts was an improvement in freight, shipping, and logistics costs as a percent of sales. SG&A expenses were 25.3% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '24, compared with 23.3% of net sales for the second quarter of last year. This approximate 200 basis point increase is primarily the result of deleverage from the year-over-year sales decline. We continue to experience headwinds related to wage inflation and have also incurred higher costs percent of sales and incentive compensation, medical expenses, and data processing versus the prior year second quarter. Depreciation and amortization in the second quarter of fiscal ‘24 increased to approximately $1.1 million in comparison to the same period last year, reflecting increased capital investments on store development, technology initiatives, and various infrastructure projects over the last couple of years. We generated $16 million of operating income or 4.3% of net sales in the second quarter this year, compared to $32.8 million or 8.4% of net sales in the prior year second quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.85 for this year's second quarter, compared to $1.86 per share in the second quarter of fiscal ‘23. We ended the second quarter of fiscal ‘24 with $33.1 million available cash and cash equivalents on our unaudited consolidated -- condensed consolidated balance sheet and $106.9 million of debt outstanding on our $160 million unsecured line of credit. Net inventory at the end of the second quarter was $430.8 million, a 17.6% increase from the prior year second quarter and up 2.4% from the beginning of the fiscal year. Please note that most of the increase in inventory versus a year ago is due to product cost inflation and mix as footwear inventory, which carries a higher average unit cost is a bigger component of the overall inventory balance than it was in the comparable period. Capital expenditures during the second quarter were $11.4 million with approximately 60% attributed to store development projects, including new stores, remodels, relocations, and new signage. We opened five net new stores in the quarter, bringing the store base to 1,148 in 36 states. We repurchased nearly 300,000 shares under our share repurchase plan in the second quarter at a total cost of approximately $11 million. We also paid a recurring quarterly dividend in the first quarter -- in the second quarter, excuse me, in the amount of $0.25 per eligible common share for a total outflow of approximately $3.2 million. Now we’re moving to slide six, year-to-date results. Total net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2024 increased 1.7% to $830.4 million, while year-to-date comparable sales have decreased 1.4% versus the same period last year. Brick-and-mortar comp sales declined 1.2% and e-commerce comp sales declined 2.2%. Gross margin was 33.3% of net sales on a year-to-date basis versus 35.7% of net sales last year. This approximate 240 basis point decline was due to lower average product margin of approximately 300 basis points and higher store occupancy costs of approximately 45 basis points. This was partially offset by year-over-year improvement in freight, shipping, and logistics costs as a percent of sales. SG&A expenses were 23% of net sales for the first six months, compared to 22.9% in the same period last year. The approximate increase of 10 basis points is primarily the result of higher medical expenses and an increase in data processing costs, partially offset by lower advertising and professional fees. We have generated $61.9 million of operating income or 7.5% of net sales through the second quarter of fiscal '24, compared to $83.5 million or 10.2% of net sales in the prior year's first six months. Net income for the first six months of this year was $46.8 million or $3.61 per diluted share, compared with $64.1 million or $4.77 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. Capital expenditures for the first six months of the fiscal year were $25.7 million, predominantly related to store initiatives, including new store openings, relocations, expansions, remodels, and technology upgrades. I'll now turn the call over to Bill to discuss consumer insights.\nBill Quinn: Thank you, Bob. Our consumer research and analysis of loyalty data gives us insight into the mindset and changing shopping patterns of our customers. To start, most customers still have elevated concerns of the general impacts of inflation. Concerns of our gas, grocery, and utility cost remained high. There is also an added concern around resuming student loan payments later this year. Looking at our loyalty purchase data, we saw sales differences through new members and existing members. Sales from new members were down, driving the sales comp decline in Q2. Our concerns around new customer sales were mitigated in the latter part of the quarter, our new customer sales grew significantly due to energy from back-to-school and launch. For the entire quarter, our existing customers, which are the vast majority of our program continue to spend more than prior year, this was consistent with what we experienced in Q1. Strength in existing customer sales is a validation of our focus on a compelling product mix, superior customer service, a best-in-class omni-channel shopping experience, and our strategic positioning in the underserved markets. Turning to our e-commerce business, in Q2 e-commerce sales were down 5.2% year-over-year. The primary headwinds included customer economic concerns, a highly promotional environment and an unfavorable launch calendar. These factors led to a decrease in traffic and conversion, which were partially offset by higher average [Technical Difficulty]. Digital sales in the latter part of the quarter were much improved due to a favorable launch cadence, a strong start to back-to-school. As always, we remain focused on the long-term in providing the best possible customer experience for online and omni-channel shopping. To that end, we have many planned initiatives for the remainder of this year to drive acquisition, engage customers, and further provide a world-class retail experience. Now, I'll turn the call back to Bob to discuss our guidance.\nBob Volke: The business outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024 remains challenging and difficult to predict. Inflation has continued to have a broad impact, not only on consumer sentiment and spending patterns, but it also contributed to increases in our operating costs in the form of higher wages and prices we paid for various goods and services. Our interest rates have driven up the cost of borrowing for us and may also be affecting discretionary purchase decisions, those consumers with variable rate loans or credit card debt. We also expect the heavier promotional environment to continue for the near-term. In summary, economic uncertainty coupled with a more cautious and selective consumer has resulted in this uncertain retail environment. As you will remember these factors resulted in us lowering our fiscal 2024 outlook at the end of the first quarter as we move beyond the second quarter and embark on the third quarter, we feel our projected fiscal 2024 financial performance continues to be aligned with the expectations we set in May. Therefore, we are reiterating our overall guidance for fiscal 2024. Slide eight summarizes our updated fiscal 2024 guidance. In summary, net sales for the full-year, including the impact of the 53rd week are anticipated to be flat to up approximately 2% compared to our fiscal 2023 results. The 53rd week is expected to be approximately 1% of full-year sales, approximately 52% of our total sales will be recognized in the second-half of the fiscal year. Comparable sales are expected decline in the low-single-digit range for the full-year. Full-year brick-and-mortar comparable sales and full-year e-commerce revenue are also anticipated to be in the negative low-single-digit range. The net new store growth expectations to open between 40 and 50 units. We anticipate the aggressive promotional environment to continue in the near-term, projected full-year gross margin range is approximately 33.9% to 34.0% of net sales. SG&A as a percent of net sales is expected to be in the range of approximately 23.3% to 23.5% of net sales. Operating margin for the year is expected to be in the range of 7.4% to 7.8% of net sales. Operating profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter benefits from higher sales volume, although the 53rd week is considered near breakeven due to the low sales volume in that extra week. We still expect to carry debt throughout the year. We project borrowings to moderate in the second-half of the year, as inventory levels decline after the back-to-school season. Diluted earnings per share anticipated to be in the range of $7 to $7.75 using an estimated full-year tax rate of approximately 23.5% to 23.7%, an estimated year-end weighted average diluted share count of approximately 12.8 million. We project capital expenditures in the range of $60 million to $70 million, with the largest allocation focused on new store growth, remodels, relocations, new store signage, and improving the consumer experience. Our capital allocation strategy continues to include share repurchases and recurring quarterly dividends in addition to the capital expenditures noted above. That concludes our prepared remarks. Rob, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMitch Kummetz: I guess, I've got a few. Maybe to start, can you address the impact that Yeezy had on the quarter? And can you say how much longer, you're going to have Yeezy product going forward?\nJared Briskin: Yes. Hey Mitch, good morning. It's Jared. Yeezy product actually launched during the third quarter, so there was no impact during the second quarter and further past the third quarter, we don't have any additional visibility at this point.\nMitch Kummetz: Okay. And then Jared on the running business you talked about improvements there. Is that a change in trend there or is that more a reflection of some change in your assortment that you've kind of cycled through maybe what was bad in that segment and now you've got better product there, can you just maybe elaborate on that?\nJared Briskin: Yes, it's two-fold. I think certainly some changes in the assortment, some new iterations of products that we delivered in preparation for back-to-school performed well. Certainly, it enhanced our focus on the performance running category and then have evolved our Lifestyle running category, some new iterations. So we feel good about the running business. As you said, historically, it's a smaller portion of our overall business, but the business is trending and performing well.\nMitch Kummetz: Okay. And then maybe one last one, just on the product margin, so 2Q was not down as much as 1Q. It sounds like you expect promotions to continue at least through the third quarter, can you just kind of walk us through how you think about product margin over the next couple of quarters?\nJared Briskin: Yes. So we still expect some pressure from our promotional environment, obviously. Stephani and her team are doing a lot of work on rightsizing [Technical Difficulty] and ensuring that the quality of our inventory gets to an exceptional level. Those are our expectations. So we still think there'll be some pressure. Some of the early reads on products from our fall assortment that started back-to-school give us some confidence, but we still have some secondary brand pressure, we still have secondary franchise pressure, and we know there still some pressure from a consumer standpoint. But we like where we're headed with our plans and our values for the back half.\nMitch Kummetz: All right. Thank you.\nJared Briskin: Thank you.\nBob Volke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Kleber with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Kleber: Hey, good morning everyone, thanks for taking the question. First, just a follow-up on Mitch's question on product margin. How much of the pressure -- and Bob, you cited about 300 basis points lower over the first-half, how much of that do you think is somewhat temporal, just given the excess inventory across the sector and the promotional activity associated with that?\nBob Volke: Yes, I think it's a great question, Justin. I think there's a lot of factors at play here. I mean you have certainly -- we're working to reduce our inventory overall, working to enhance the quality of our inventory overall. There is a lot of product in the marketplace, particular downstream that we believe will still have significant promotional activity, plus we have some of the concerns for the consumer that Bill mentioned. So putting all those things together from an outlook perspective, tends to be a little bit difficult as far as what we have in the pipeline. We're very, very confident. The questions remains is how fast we get an optimal level in quality of inventory.\nJustin Kleber: Got it. Okay, it makes sense, Jared. Bob, question for you on the freight shipping and logistics cost favorability. How much of that is just the external environment versus maybe some internal initiatives or actions on your guys' part?\nBob Volke: I think it's probably a combination of both, obviously. We obviously cycled through some higher freight costs in previous periods and some of the comparable periods, and we've obviously flowed some of that through the P&L over previous quarters. We continue to always look at ways to make the process more efficient, getting closer to the consumer in terms of delivery cost, obviously running things through our distribution center more quickly and more efficiently. So I'd say it's probably a little bit, kind of, mix of both about 50/50 if have to guess, and I think we're continuing to look at how receipt flow impacts that number in the back half of the year and we again think that we're moving in the right direction in terms of overall freight, shipping, and logistics costs.\nJustin Kleber: Okay. Good to hear. Last one for me, guys just on I guess the cadence of comp throughout the quarter, clearly, July it sounds like it was the strongest month given back-to-school. Any comment on the back-to-school strength late in the quarter has kind of carried over here into the first part of 3Q?\nJared Briskin: Yes, Justin, it is Jared. Obviously, as we said, we were pleased to start of back-to-school what occurred in the second quarter. Happy with a lot of other products that we delivered. Certainly, as we mentioned, the seasonal aspect of apparel gave us some confidence and the back-to-school categories performed very well. At this point, it's really still early to comment on back-to-school in its totality. I think we feel pretty comfortable that we've captured our forecast for back-to-school within our guidance.\nJustin Kleber: Great. All right. Thanks everyone.\nJared Briskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please proceed with your question.\nSam Poser: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Can you tell -- just to make this simple -- could you tell us what the comps were by month by chance?\nMike Longo: Hi, Sam, Mike. Good to hear from you. It's our custom not to comment on intra-quarter trends and so as…\nSam Poser: We're looking backwards…\nMike Longo: Yes, got it, but we -- I think we followed the most of the trends of the industry. We had a good July. I think it would be the best way to say it.\nSam Poser: We positive in July? How about that question.\nMike Longo: Yes, we were.\nSam Poser: And then, Jared, you talked about -- you all talked about the consumer being more particular and how well you did with some of the big launch products. So my question is as you look ahead, is there going to be enough product that to put -- for those particular customers and were those particular customers -- those customers have, let's say, bought the launch product, was there any demographics similarity between them or if the product was right they just show up. And again had other products that they just didn't like as much as they did?\nJared Briskin: Yes, I think Sam, I mean, if the product is right and the consumer perceives value in the product that value creation could come from launch and scarcity, it could come from materials, it could come from the story, it could come from franchise management. A lot of things can drive that value and that demand. Again, as we -- as I've said, we're pretty confident in the pipeline of product, as far as what's coming in from a new perspective. I think Stephani and team continue to refine our assortments and make them as dynamic as we can for our consumer. At the same time, there's challenges with the consumer, we want to balance our inventory correctly, so there are some other offsets as well but we feel good about the pipeline. Our partnership is with our brands remain fantastic. We have lots of focus on our business. We were focused on because of the underserved markets that we cater to and largely, we're complementary and incremental to the market. So it's creating a lot of opportunity and focus with our brand partners.\nSam Poser: Just, I mean, just a quick follow-up on that. When the supply chain issues were going on some time ago, you made some decisions to bring in some apparel and other things to -- my impression was sort of to fill up the stores. So looking back on what happened then and for the sake of argument 70% of the product is compelling stuff, it's going to attract that particular customer. Do you -- are you just not going to buy the other 30%, even if and sort of make the stores look full with the good stuff instead of trying to fill [multiple Speakers]\nJared Briskin: Yes, I mean, I would say we never just tried about bad stuff. Obviously, we always try to buy just the good stuff. But I think as the consumer now has become a little bit more careful around some other choices, we have to continue to refine that in what we do. We're following what we see from a pattern standpoint to consumers and we believe we have access to the things that they're interested in. And those are things we're making investments in, and we're pulling back in places that we don't believe are either on trend or the consumer doesn't have interest in. But we never try to just buy things that we don't think are going to resonate with our consumer. But that funnel was a lot wider when there was a lot of cash in the market. And today, the funnel is much more narrow and we're down our focus around what we put in the assortments.\nSam Poser: Sorry, one last thing. Does that narrow funnel? I mean is the consumer more cautious or more particular? And that narrow funnel, that's what somebody else I know uses, is a situation where when you have exactly what that consumer wants, they buy it and when they -- and if somebody else is exactly what they want or another category or entertainment or something they'll buy it from them. Is that a side of a weak consumer or just a much more particular consumer?\nJared Briskin: I think it's some of both, to be frank. And I think Bill has got some information on this that he can talk to.\nBill Quinn: Yes, Sam. Hi Sam it's Bill. So we're looking at two different lenses. First of all, the existing customers we have, which is the bulk of our customers are doing well. So we actually saw them have a positive comp here in Q2, but it's really the new customers that we're seeing that impact. And it's just less of them coming in. But when they come in, they're buying the same amount actually a little bit more. Some of that is economic. We're in the good time to sell a lot of new customers. And obviously, we're seeing the reverse of that. And some of that is timing where we saw new customers. We saw a nice increase in July and the start of back-to-school with those customers, because of back-to-school as well as launch.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much. Continued success.\nSam Poser: Thank you.\nJared Briskin: Thank you, Sam.\nOperator: Our next question is from Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.\nCristina Fernandez: Hi, good morning. I wanted to see if you can comment more about the composition of the inventory, particularly interested in, I guess, how much age or clearance inventory is still left versus the end of the first quarter. And the excess inventory where it's more concentrated? Is it still primarily apparel footwear as well? Any color there would be helpful.\nJared Briskin: Yes. Cristina, it's Jared. Yes, I think we continue to strive to get to not just an optimal level of inventory, but optimal health of inventory. The team has been working incredibly hard at this initially some of the challenges were centered around apparel and that was a significant focus of ours to get that business cleaner and healthier. And we're largely at that point now. We still have some challenges around secondary brands and franchises. Within the footwear business, that will continue to take a little bit of time to work through. Again, as we said, we feel like we can work those things down during the back half of the year and really get to an optimal level continue to get great support from our vendor partners to help balance that inventory. We obviously have been more promotional to try and drive through some of that aged inventory. But taking a little bit longer than we'd like, but we are making strides and feel very confident in what we can achieve in the back half based on what the team is getting accomplished.\nCristina Fernandez: And then my second question is on the outlook for the third versus -- for the fourth quarter, your sales outlook implies the fourth quarter being a lot better with on my math comped down low single digits versus down mid to high in the past two quarters. So what gives you confidence that the fourth quarter will be better? Is it just the comparisons? Or are you seeing a better product launch calendar?\nJared Briskin: As we said, we're pretty confident in our assortments as a whole and certainly in the calendar as a whole. I think our expectations are that as we get to a cleaner position on inventory and a more healthy level of inventory, we'll have more of that excites consumers to further begin into the back half of the year.\nCristina Fernandez: And just one last clarification. I wanted to understand the outperformance in women's relative to men and kids. Is it because the launch calendar was better for women or it's just less dependent on the newer launch?\nJared Briskin: The women's business is a little less dependent on the launch calendar. So there was an outsized impact to the men's and kids business negatively as a result of the launch calendar. But as a reminder, we've had a heavy, heavy focus on the women's business for a number of years now, including the reorganization of our merchant teams to get more focused around the women's business and the kids business. So we're pretty proud of what's been accomplished in women's and feel like we have a nice opportunity ahead.\nCristina Fernandez: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Lawrence with Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Lawrence: Good morning, guys.\nMike Longo: Good morning.\nJared Briskin: Good morning.\nJohn Lawrence: First of all, could you talk a little bit about new stores, Mike, the ones you've opened in the last couple of years, how are they coming out of the ground and recent openings in this environment? How do they get your [Technical Difficulty]\nMike Longo: Thank you. We've been very pleased with our new store performance. As we've repeated a couple of times, we've got a goal that we've talked about 40 to 50 net new stores a year. That includes a handful of closures every year because every retailer does that. The -- I think we disclosed last year that Las Vegas was our new market and by Las Vegas. We do not mean on the script where the tourists go, we mean where the people live and those stores are doing really, really well. Very pleased with that. And of course, we're positioning them for the big event of the Super Bowl in February. Our newest market, the news is broken on is Milwaukee. We like Milwaukee. We've been in past retailers been in Milwaukee quite a bit. It's a great market for us, and we'll be breaking that market relatively soon. And then most importantly, so those are new markets. Most importantly, we've got pillow markets, which are always more profitable, because you've built brand equity in those markets, say, Southeastern Georgia or the Panhandle, Florida, or Arizona or parts of California. When we go fill those markets in between two stores, we can further our culture, our operational culture where we can bring in seasoned veteran players to run the stores. You can take an assistant store manager from one store and make them the store manager of the new store and they bring select members of the crew. So that always works better operationally. And then the logistics of the hub-and-spoke network that we run, we can leverage that as well. And so all those obvious operational efficiencies are important, but the most important part is the consumer knows us, they trust us. And we hire from the neighborhoods that we're in. We run that neighborhood store, and we get rewarded for that in those new stores.\nJohn Lawrence: Great, thanks. And follow-up Bob, what kind of level some of the costs we saw, the medical cost, et cetera, what do you need to see to start leveraging some of that or being able to kind of comp increase, would it take to stop some of that deleverage on the cost line?\nBob Volke: Yes. I don't know if it's so much like a specific spend category. One of the things we continue to do is invest in not only the consumer experience and the physical and omnichannel store revenue streams is also kind of putting some more infrastructure within the back office. So as you know, we've done a lot of upgrades as we've mentioned over the last couple of years on providing more tools within, say, the store support center and the distribution facility become more efficient. So we don't really get into trying to manage to a specific comp number. It's more about trying to run the business as efficiently and effectively as possible. And again, I think we've made some structural changes in our organization over the last 12 to 18 months. We continue to find ways to leverage these investments that we've made in the back office operations to become more efficient. And I think what's going to happen is you'll see that, again, we'll continue to try to strive to keep that SG&A level at a similar levels or declining, obviously, in the future, but not really necessarily tied to a specific comp sales. It's more about just going after more efficiency and effectiveness.\nJohn Lawrence: Great, thanks guys. Good luck.\nBob Volke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anna Glaessgen with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nAnna Glaessgen: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to turn back to guidance. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect the promotional environment to continue at least through the third quarter. Should we be expecting some improvement in the fourth quarter? Any context around that and what's in the guidance would be great?\nJared Briskin: Yes. I think the comment, certainly, we expect an environment to be commercial in the back half of the year. I think we feel more confidence in have position in the fourth quarter at with some of the conversations in terms specifically into the third quarter, but we feel like we'll be largely past the big challenges with regard to some of our composition of our inventory issues by the time we get into the fourth quarter.\nAnna Glaessgen: Got it. And we've heard other retailers talk about shrink a lot. Is that something you're seeing as well?\nMike Longo: We are. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. So while we experience a minimal amount of shrink in our omnichannel experience, it's mostly situated in the brick-and-mortar. And so I'll let Ben take that question.\nBen Knighten: Yes, I appreciate the question. Similar to most retailers, we've seen some elevated strength levels really over the last couple of years. Organized prime is real, and it does impact us. That said, kind of comparing to last year, shrink really hasn't had a material impact to our gross margin percentage. I'll also point out that's included in our guidance for the back half of the year. We really focus on customer service and know that that's really our biggest deterrent from a shrink perspective and do that each and every day.\nMike Longo: Yes. And let me follow-up on a couple of points. Certainly, topical, it's an issue that's come up a considerable amount this week in particular. And just to remind everybody, the biggest component of shrink is theft. And not to bury the lead. It's clear and obvious that it's theft. It's a cost to our companies and it's a tax on the consumer. It's something like every cost, whether it's a tax levy by the government or it's a problem with operations, all those get passed onto the consumer. I thought Walmart did a very good job this week in their conference call, CFO said, shrink has increased a bit this year and an increase last year. it was uneven across the country. That rises very well with what we're seeing. And as well, the CEO, Doug McMillon said, and “there needs to be action taken to help protect people from crime, including theft” I felt that was on the money and appreciated them saying it. And then I'd further add that the CEO of the National Retail Federation, Matt Shay, did a very nice job on CNBC Wednesday morning on Squawk Box and he discussed the issues to include the resale market and marketplaces as being a particular problem and I thought that resonated with us. So if you have a chance to rewatch that, I would encourage it.\nAnna Glaessgen: Thanks for that. And just one clarification on the accounting around shrink. Some other retailers have mentioned that they do on annual physical account. Can you remind us your policies around that?\nBob Volke: So we take two physical counts currently in all of our stores. We also use RFID technology to take basically weekly snapshots of some percentage of our inventory. We don't have 100% of our product tag with RFID. But we are keeping pretty close to shrink levels pretty much on a weekly basis with that RFID and again, kind of locking everything in twice a year with most of our stores, also do cycle counting and some physical accounting within our distribution centers. So we feel our shrink accounting is pretty current and on point at this point.\nAnna Glaessgen: Great. Thanks so much.\nBob Volke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Perry with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Perry: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just first, Jared, maybe could you help us, it seems like the launch calendar was a key driver in the quarter. Can you just talk about how the launch calendar looks for the balance of the year and does it sort of look similar to how it did in July in the back half of the quarter, which really drove a nice acceleration for you guys? And then maybe just remind us the quantity of the launch product that you're getting sort of year-over-year, is that better given sort of the downsizing we've seen from other retailers in the network? Thanks.\nJared Briskin: Hey, Alex, good morning. It's Jared. I would say it this way. Obviously, the launch calendar always has been somewhat volatile. It will remain volatile. It's been volatile. I'll reiterate what I said earlier, I think we're very confident in what we have in the pipeline, both from a launch perspective and from a non-launch perspective. So I think that there could be movement in the calendar that historically always has been. So we'll see what occurs. But our confidence level is high with regard to the assortment. Our partnerships with the brands continue to be excellent. We continue to get more and more focus because of the incremental nature of our business. So again, we feel pretty good about where we stand with regard to the quality of our order book.\nAlex Perry: Perfect. And then I just wanted to ask, in terms of the lapping of some of the delayed apparel receipts from last year, how are you guys sort of thinking about that and just the composition of the inventory versus sort of what you saw last year? And just remind us how much that affected the business last year? And how -- when you really started to promote that product?\nJared Briskin: Yes. So the big challenge last year really was from last year and the prior year, it was just product delivering in the incorrect season, right? So you had spring product delivery in the fall, fall product delivery in the spring, as examples. And those challenges are somewhat difficult to overcome because apparel was very seasonal in nature. That, obviously, now that the supply chain has improved significantly, we're better, more consistent with what we've seen historically with regard to spring and summer liquidations, what we have from a timing perspective coming in around fall and seasonal. We're getting back to some more historical norms around delivery cadence and seeing some success from it. So we're a little bit more confident that we won't have some of those seasonal challenges that really affected the promotions.\nAlex Perry: Great. And then just two quick ones. I guess, one, just can you give us a little more color on how you're thinking about your exposure, the student loan repayments coming back on. I think you layered in commentary about that being an additional headwind. Do you think you have an outsized impact there? Or how are you sort of thinking about that?\nMike Longo: Bill, do you want to take that one?\nBill Quinn: Yes. Alex. So we do a quarterly survey with our customers, and that was one of the questions this quarter that we asked. Definitely a concern overall. We dug further into it, a small portion of customers are highly concerned. So that's something that we need to watch. There's definitely headlines out there. There could be some mitigation of what's going to happen in October. But that's definitely something that we're going to continue to monitor and get more information from in terms of our customers.\nAlex Perry: Perfect. And then just my last one, maybe Bob, on the margins, any help on sort of 3Q versus 4Q gross margin cadence? Is it fair? I think you had inventory getting better by 4Q. So is it fair to say 3Q gross margins down year-over-year and then some improvement on a Y-over-Y basis, in 4Q? Or how should we be thinking about that?\nBob Volke: Again, I think we're not going to get into specific Q3, Q4 relationships. Obviously, Q4 is a higher volume sales quarter. So you get a little additional leverage on things like your store occupancy. Again, like Jared said earlier, launch calendars can kind of move a little bit between quarters, between periods. At this point in time, again, I think we're obviously going to hopefully move through some of that older inventory more efficiently as we get through Q3, maybe a little bit less of that in Q4. I'll let you kind of predict how that puts out in your own model. But again, I think we see that we'll see a little bit more better back half in terms of comparison than we saw in the first half of the year.\nAlex Perry: Perfect. Best of luck going forward.\nBob Volke: Thank you.\nBill Quinn: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question is from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please proceed with your question.\nSam Poser: Just two quick ones. Thank you. The -- in the new market like Las Vegas, what kind of -- are you seeing a subsequent e-commerce lift with that? And can you give us some idea of what you're seeing how that all works, what the relationship is as you go into new markets?\nMike Longo: Yes. This is Mike. So in layman's terms, we see e-commerce sales go up as we increase the store count in the community. It's also though a component of why we open a store in a particular geography because we examined the direct-to-consumer sales in those ZIP codes, and we make it part of our algorithm and part of the proof of should we open a store. And so then when we actually open the store, we get an outsized portion of the sales in that ZIP code. And that allows us to continue to go down the path of being incremental and complementary to our major brand partners.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then, Jared, to follow-up on one of the other questions just directly. With the launch product, are your allocations up year-over-year?\nMike Longo: Even he chuckle.\nJared Briskin: He did chuckle. I'll answer it the same way I've answered, Sam. We're very confident in our order book and very confident in the support that we're getting from all of our key brands.\nSam Poser: Right. I understand that. Are they up year-over-year?\nJared Briskin: We'll let you infer that based on our commentary.\nSam Poser: So if we wrote, yes, your inventories up, your allocations are up year-over-year, that would be correct based on your commentary?\nJared Briskin: We're getting much more focus from our brand partners, yes.\nSam Poser: Okay. Well, that was easy. You could just have that to begin with. Continued success.\nJared Briskin: Thank you. We appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Lawrence with Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Lawrence: Yes. Mike, when you look at in the history of Hibbett, college football has been important. How -- as we start that, especially on the SEC, a lot of teams are expected to do very well. How important is that season for the company at this point?\nMike Longo: It's -- all sports are important to us. It's part of the DNA of the company. It's part of the culture of sport -- that is part of our major brand partners, Ethos as well as ours. I'm surprised you didn't leave with Army, but we'll go with the SEC for just a moment. And yes, it's important in all the other conferences as well. So college football, it's interesting because it's more of an event. It's less about the game, and it's more about a gathering of people celebrating the things that they have in common, whether it's a team or it's a sport or it's their family or it's just an opportunity to get together. And every time people gather they think about their personal appearance and they think about how they want to occur to their peers, their families and to each other and the self-pride that goes with it. And that's one of the things that's just a really interesting business model because it really is an expression of your lifestyle and what you wear, and it starts with the toe and it works upwards. And that's why we say toe-to-head so often. So football and any other thing that causes people to gather drive sales.\nJohn Lawrence: Great, thank you. Good luck\nMike Longo : Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Longo for closing comments.\nMike Longo: Thank you so much. We appreciate everyone coming on today and taking your time to -- and spending it with us. We look forward to reporting Q3. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Gavin Bell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nGavin Bell: Thank you, and good morning.

I'll now turn the call over to Mike Longo.\nMike Longo: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to the Hibbett Q1 earnings call. For those of you following along, I'm on Slide 3. Our financial and operating results for the first quarter reflect the challenging retail environment. Our consumers face difficulties ranging from inflation to fears over job loss. This and other factors have combined to lower consumer sentiment, and we think this adversely affect sales. Also, the important tax season in the first quarter was negatively affected by lower tax returns versus last year and caused sales come in lower than our expectations. Having said that, we still achieved a 7.4% year-over-year sales growth and a 4.1% comp sales increase, we believe these sales results in increased share for Hibbett and our reason for confidence in our business model. Also our strong relationships with our brand partners give us the ability and confidence to continue to execute our store opening plan. We continue to invest in our already best-in-class consumer experience and business model while still taking costs out of the business. In the first quarter, we managed to produce leverage on SG&A of 140 basis points versus last year. And all the while, we believe we increased our market share. We believe we have a proven operating model that will support our business regardless of market conditions, and we remain committed to executing our strategy of focusing on our distinct competitive advantages, namely our customer service, a compelling product selection, best-in-class omnichannel experience and our positioning in underserved markets. In summary, we believe Hibbett is well positioned for the short and long-term to continue to grow and increase market share. Before turning the call over to Jared, I'd like to thank our approximately 11,000 team members across the organization, whether they're working in our stores or on our omnichannel platform, our logistics facilities or our Store Support Center. They're the face of Hibbett providing consistent superior service that's synonymous with our brand. I'll now turn it over to Jared.\nJared Briskin: Thank you, Mike. Good morning. The first quarter started strong with double-digit gains in the first half of the quarter. As March progressed, we began to see some deceleration in our comp performance and this deceleration continued to pressure the business into April, leading to our total comp of just over 4%. Footwear was the strongest category during the quarter, growing high teens versus the prior year. Our strong footwear results continue to be driven by several solid launches as well as strength across basketball, lifestyle and casual categories. In addition, we saw an improving trend in our running business. Apparel and Team Sports were both negative for the quarter with Apparel down in the low 20s. Approximately half of the decline in Apparel came from winter carryover in the prior year that we did not anniversary. This was planned in order to ensure that our inventory was seasonably appropriate now that the supply chain is more predictable. Sales of spring and summer apparel started the season slowly and remain under pressure due to the consumer environment. Specific to Footwear and Apparel, men's, women's and kids all comped positively driven by our footwear results. Men's and women's both were up in the low single digits. Kids was up in the high teens. Slowdown in sales in the back half of the quarter, the continued promotional environment and a much more selective consumer, prompted additional markdowns and promotional activity during the back half of the quarter. We expect this to continue at least through the third quarter as we work to reduce our inventory. These promotional efforts as well as support from our key brand partners will help us to achieve our goals for inventory reduction. While year-over-year inventory compares will still be volatile due to the challenges in the supply chain during fiscal '23, our expectations remain the same for our inventory levels. We will have growth in the first half of the year and year-over-year declines in the second half of the year. I'll now hand it over to Bob to cover our financial results.\nBob Volke: Thank you, Jared, and good morning. Please refer to Slide 5. As a reminder, our first quarter results are reported on a consolidated basis that includes both the EBIT and City Gear brands. Total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 7.4% to $455.5 million from $424.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Overall comp sales increased 4.1% versus the prior year first quarter. Brick-and-mortar comp sales were up 4.7% compared to the prior year's first quarter, while e-commerce sales increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. E-commerce sales accounted for 13.7% of net sales during the current quarter compared to 14.6% in the first quarter last year. Gross margin was 33.7% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared with 37% in the first quarter of the prior year. This approximate 330 basis point decline was driven primarily by lower average product margin. Average product margin in the first quarter of fiscal '24 was approximately 375 basis points lower than the prior year first quarter due to higher promotional activity across both footwear and apparel. Store occupancy was relatively flat as a percent of sales year-over-year, while both freight and logistics operations were favorable as a percent of net sales. Our operating, selling and administrative expenses were 21.1% of net sales for the first quarter compared with 22.5% of net sales for the first quarter last year. This approximate 140 basis point improvement is primarily the result of expense reduction initiatives, lower discretionary advertising spend and reduced incentive compensation expense, partially offset by wage inflation. Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter of fiscal '24 increased approximately $1.2 million in comparison to the same period last year, reflecting increased capital investment on store development and infrastructure projects. We generated $45.9 million of operating income or 10.1% of net sales in the first quarter compared to $50.7 million or 12% of net sales in the prior year's first quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $2.74 for this year compared to $2.89 per share in the prior year first quarter. We ended the first quarter of fiscal '24 with $26.9 million of available cash and cash equivalents on our unaudited consolidated balance sheet and $103.6 million of debt outstanding on our $160 million line of credit. Net inventory at the end of the first quarter was $438 million, a 39.1% increase from the first quarter of fiscal '23 and up 4.1% from the beginning of the year. Please note that the majority of this increase year-over-year is due to inflation and product mix. Inventory units are up approximately 8%, and we have a heavier mix of footwear, which carries a higher average unit cost. Capital expenditures during the first quarter were $14.2 million, with over 60% of that focused on store development projects, including new stores, remodels and relocations. We opened 10 net new stores in the first quarter, bringing the store base to 1,143 in 36 states. We also completed 16 store remodels and three relocations. The remainder of our capital expenditures for the quarter were related to technology and infrastructure projects. We bought back nearly 160,000 shares under our share repurchase plan in the first quarter at a total cost of $10.2 million. We also paid a recurring quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.25 per eligible share for a total outflow of $3.2 million. I'll now turn the call over to Bill to discuss the latest consumer insights.\nBill Quinn: Thank you, Bob. Despite a challenging retail environment and pervasive inflationary impacts, our customers continue to increase their shopping with us during the first quarter. In Q1, our loyalty sales were up low double digits. This growth was driven by increased sales from our existing customers. Our total customer base grew, increased their average purchase, and made more visits. However, we have started to see a slowdown in new customer shopping and our consumer research indicates that there will be ongoing challenges to discretionary spend this year. In particular, customers have grown more cautious as concerns over inflation continue and also fears over job loss are rising. Turning to our e-commerce business. In Q1, e-commerce sales were essentially flat versus the prior year. The primary headwinds included in macroeconomic environment, a highly promotional online environment and greater inventory availability in stores, which drove more in-store shopping. These factors led to decreases in traffic and conversion, which were offset by higher average purchases. As always, we remain focused on the long term and providing the best possible customer experience for online and omnichannel shopping. To that end, we have many planned investments in improving our loyalty program, our core customer e-commerce experience, and further evolving our omnichannel offerings. We believe these efforts will continue to attract and retain customers. I will now turn the call back to Bob to discuss our guidance.\nBob Volke: The business outlook for the remainder of fiscal '24 continues to be complex and difficult to forecast. There are several significant headwinds to consider as we proceed through the year. Inflation has a broad impact not only on consumer sentiment and spending patterns, but also contributes to operating cost increases in the form of wages and prices paid for goods and services. Higher interest rates have driven up the cost of borrowing for us that may also be affecting discretionary purchase decisions for those consumers with variable rate loans and credit card debt. We also expect the heavier promotional environment we have seen over the last two quarters to continue for the near term. In summary, economic uncertainty, coupled with a more cautious and increasingly stressed consumer, has resulted in lower expectations for the remainder of this fiscal year. As noted previously, we still have confidence in our business model and our ability to track new customers while providing exceptional customer service and product assortment to our existing customers. We continue to make investments in the most critical elements of our business, new store development, the consumer experience and operational efficiencies. Our inventory mix and assortments have become healthier over the last several months, and we have made progress on reducing the ongoing operational costs of the organization. I'll now turn to Slide 7 that summarizes our guidance. Net sales for the full year, including the impact of the 53rd week are anticipated to be flat to up approximately 2% compared to our fiscal 2023 results. The 53rd week is still expected to be approximately 1% of full year sales. The breakdown of sales by quarter remains unchanged from the previous guidance provided. We believe that the first quarter represented approximately 26% of full year sales with approximately 22% in the second quarter approximately 24% in the third quarter and approximately 28% in the fourth quarter, including the 53rd week. Comparable sales are now expected to decline in the low single-digit range for the full year. Full year brick-and-mortar comparable sales and full year e-commerce revenue are also anticipated to both be in the negative low single-digit range. Net new store growth remains unchanged with an expectation to open between 40 and 50 units. We anticipate the aggressive promotional environment to continue in the near term with a heavier impact on the second quarter. The lower forecasted annual sales volume will also create additional deleverage of store occupancy costs. As a result, we revised -- the revised projected full year gross margin rate is approximately 33.9% to 34.0% of net sales. We expect the second quarter will yield the lowest gross margin results of the year with improvement anticipated in the back half of the year. Although we were able to generate SG&A leverage in the first quarter this year compared to last year and are making good progress on cost savings initiatives, we anticipate the quarterly comparisons to the prior year to be more difficult due to fixed cost deleverage resulting from lower sales expectations as well as ongoing inflationary pressure in wages and other goods and services. SG&A as a percent of net sales is now expected to be in the range of approximately 23.3% to 23.5% of net sales. Once again, the second quarter will be more heavily impacted and is expected to be the lowest sales quarter of the year. Due to the factors mentioned previously, operating margin for the year is now expected to be in the range of 7.4% to 7.8% of net sales. Operating profit as a percent of net sales in the first quarter and fourth quarter benefit from higher sales volume, although the 53rd week is considered near breakeven due to the low sales volume in that extra week. We expect that operating profit as a percent of sales will be modestly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. We still expect to carry debt for the majority of the year. We project borrowings will be higher in the first half of the year as current inventory levels are not expected to decline significantly until after the back-to-school season. The lower full year sales guidance is anticipated to result in a higher interest expense than communicated in our previous guidance. Interest expense for the full year is now projected to be approximately 40 to 45 basis points of net sales, peaking in the second quarter and declining as the year progresses. Diluted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $7 to $7.75 using an estimated full year tax rate of approximately 23.5% to 23.7% and an estimated year-end weighted average diluted share count of approximately 12.8 million. We still project capital expenditures in the range of $60 million to $70 million, with the largest allocation focused on new store growth, remodels, relocations, new store signage and improving the consumer experience. Our capital allocation strategy continues to include share repurchases and recurring quarterly dividends in addition to the capital expenditures noted above. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mitch Kummetz with Seaport Research. Please proceed.\nMitch Kummetz: I guess, Mike, just to start on the quarter. Can you kind of walk us through metrics like traffic ticket conversion? I'm curious, it sounds like the back half of the quarter was tougher than the first half. I'm curious how some of those metrics might have evolved as the quarter transpired?\nMike Longo: Sure. Thanks for the question. Thanks for being on today. In the beginning of the quarter, we were seeing really good results, and we were seeing an increase in both transactions as well as AUR, and therefore, average ticket. As the quarter continued, however, it did get significantly negative with regards to transactions. We tie that back directly to the overhang, of course, of consumer sentiment, but more directly, the tax returns being down. And as you know, tax returns are disproportionately going to affect our customer and our business in Q1, which we, as you know, typically refer to as tax season.\nMitch Kummetz: And then, Bob, on the guide for 2Q, it sounds like you expect some pretty heavy margin pressure there on the product margin side. I know that in the first quarter, it was down 370 bps. Are you looking for something similar there in 2Q?\nBob Volke: I'll start, and then Jared can add some color. The expectation is that the trends we've seen here in the second half of the first quarter kind of continues into Q2. Q2 is notoriously kind of a quiet quarter for us. There's not a lot of big events or holidays that kind of drive the business. So, the expectation is that we'll still be working through some of our higher inventory levels, and that will require us to continue to be in somewhat promotional mode at this point. Jared?\nJared Briskin: Yes, Mitch. It's Jared. I think Bob's got it exactly right. I mean we still expect some pressure very similarly to what we saw in the first quarter, but we have recently seen some pretty significant incremental promotions over and above what we saw first quarter from the marketplace as a whole. So, it will likely continue to put some pressure. We've been pretty clear around our inventory aspirations with -- from our first half and second half perspective. So obviously, we want to ensure that we can maintain that projection with regard to inventory. So what's happening externally from a marketplace perspective could put some additional pressure on Q2.\nMitch Kummetz: Okay. And then lastly, I just want to get your thoughts on back-to-school. I mean, it seems like you expect the consumer to remain fairly pressured. But how are you feeling about kind of your inventory and your access to product for back-to-school? And I also heard somewhere that maybe the tax-free day outlook could be better this year than a year ago, and I don't know if you're the least bit optimistic that, that could maybe drive some traffic and conversion?\nJared Briskin: Yes, Mitch, I think we're confident in our -- first of all, the inventory that we have heading into back-to-school, while the inventory is elevated over where we'd like it to be. The team has been extremely careful with regard to receipts that are coming in for back-to-school, ensuring that we're only looking at what we like to call A players. So, we feel very good about those investments and that we'll have what the consumer is looking for. Typically, from a back-to-school season, Q2 and Q3 kind of have a blend between our back-to-school. Historically, it starts at the end of July and runs through the middle of August. We believe historically, what we've seen pressured consumer that tends to drive the business more and more last minute. So, our expectations are that some of that back-to-school flow will likely fall more into Q3 than Q2. But we do feel from a product perspective, we'll have enough products and energy to drive the business that is outlined in our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Perry with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nAlex Perry: I guess just first, can you maybe talk about the more recent run rate of the business as you move further away from some of the tax refund headwinds?\nJared Briskin: Yes, Alex, it's Jared. As we said, we got off to a really hot start in the first quarter, strong, strong, double-digit increases, and that really started to falter as we got towards the end of the quarter. We really haven't seen anything change at this point. A level product launches still performing extremely well, but nothing from a step change perspective based on what we saw towards the back end of the quarter.\nAlex Perry: Great. That's really helpful. And then just on the top line, can you just talk about how you're thinking about the second quarter versus the rest of the year? I think the guide implies like a sort of negative mid-single digits to high single-digit comp in the second half. I guess first part of the question, is that right? And then in the press release, you said that these headwinds will be more impactful on our second fiscal quarter than in the back half of the year. Is that implying that you're sort of expecting the consumer to come back in the back half of the year?\nJared Briskin: Alex, I think that's hard to say. I mean I think specific to the second quarter, obviously, the run rate at the end of the first quarter was not where we would like it to be. So that presents a concern. The conversation with regard to back-to-school and potentially some more back-to-school business moving into third quarter, based on the pressure that the consumer is under and more last minute, along with the elevated promotional activity, that's going on in the marketplace. I mean, all of those things cause us to be really conservative with regard to second quarter specifically. As far as the outlook for the rest of the year, we're really trying to work towards what our new normal is, what these new quarterly and monthly splits look like. Obviously, we have information from a pre-pandemic perspective, but the new information from a post standpoint. So really understanding how that looks quarter-over-quarter, period-over-period, has become quite the forecasting challenge. Then you add in the volatility of the consumer and the volatility of our back-to-school business, which always crosses between the second and third quarter. So, all of those things are causing us to be very conservative.\nAlex Perry: Great. And then my last one was just -- I just want to clarify sort of the monthly cadence on the quarter. So it sounds like maybe comps were -- April was the worst month of comps. I think, there's a better launch calendar. That's where the launch calendar improved the most in April. So is it that like your casual footwear business and apparel business really -- and you said the liquidation times in the launch is still good. So, is it like the casual apparel and footwear business, just -- you just saw more precipitous declines in those businesses in April? Is that sort of a fair assessment?\nJared Briskin: Yes, that's how we define it. I'm not sure if I would use casual, but we saw no deceleration at all in the launch product from a liquidation perspective, what we call the day players again. But secondary franchises, secondary brands, as we've called out in previous quarters, have gotten really challenging and has slowed down. The consumer is being extremely selective what they're interested in and what they're willing to purchase. And that continues to put some pressure on some of our liquidation efforts in those products, where we're increasing promotions and markdowns to try and accelerate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please proceed.\nSam Poser: Can you talk a little bit about how you planning the business, any evolution in the process of planning? Because while same-store sales are going to decelerate for the rest of the year, which you talked about before, you're expecting some margin improvement in the -- margins going to get less worse than the back half. So I'm wondering sort of from a planning process, taking the macro out of it, what can you guys do better to get there in the face of the environment?\nJared Briskin: Yes, Sam, it's Jared. I'll start. So obviously, first and foremost, we're obviously not happy with where we are. We're not happy with the composition of the inventory right now, but we are happy with our continued access to high liquidation, highly scarce product that we call A players. So we still see that providing a lot of momentum, and we're making a lot of consumers very happy when we provide that inventory. As we go through into the back half of the year, really starting in the second quarter, we were significantly more conservative with regard to our buying, not only with how much we were buying, but also what we were buying with just an intense focus on only those A players as we described. So we believe that's going to help us significantly our inventory liquidation efforts that we've had underway with regard to secondary brands and secondary franchises are going a little slower than we like, again, based on the consumer environment and based off the consumer being very selective. But that's all we have coming in through the balance of the year is what we believe to be that high-grade product. And we do expect, as we get our inventory levels back below last year levels in the back half of the year, we'll see some improvements in our aged inventory. And that, we believe, put a little less pressure from a markdown and promotional cadence that we've been doing.\nSam Poser: And when you say your inventory is going to be below last year, to what degree, I mean -- because I thought you ended Q4, probably about $50 million heavy. I think it may have gone up to about $90 million now. And I figure you still got to get it to about at least 10% below last year from a pure dollar perspective to sort of be optimum. Am I thinking about that right?\nJared Briskin: I think you're on the right track. I don't know if we will land any exact same place from an optimum perspective, but we are tracking to get below last year level, likely more in the single-digit range by the end of the third quarter and then a significant reduction by the end of the fourth quarter at a similar level to what you just described. Again, I think we want to be very careful with getting real specific here. We have our aspirations of where we want to be from an inventory perspective. We're confident in our plan, but there's a lot of unknowns at this point that we want to make sure that we take into account. But your thought process around optimal level of inventory is not that far off from where ours is.\nSam Poser: Mike, can I ask one thing?\nMike Longo: Of course.\nSam Poser: Over the last, I think, four or five quarters, you've missed -- the numbers have moved around, you've missed The Street estimates and so on. So have you taken sort of a -- I mean, what makes you feel comfortable you've sort of taken the draconian enough view of this year in the -- in what you've now put out there?\nMike Longo: Thank you. I think you have to track back to the cause, right? What's the cause of change? The approximate cause of change in Q1, the biggest contributor was the fact that tax returns came in significantly unfavorable. And I haven't found anybody who had that in their guidance. I haven't found anybody who said, \"Well, yes, you should have known that.\" So we didn't know that. We were surprised we didn't stand around and wait for it to happen to us. We began to take action very rapidly. In anticipation of risk in the year, we also, as we communicated, took on a systematic review of our costs, which are in the early innings, but we're certainly doing that. So -- okay, so get back to the question. So what happened? In the backdrop of pretty serious macroeconomic challenges, we had a specific pinpoint Q1 problem. And that being a significant part of our year was part of the downdraft. In addition to that then going forward, we still have the overhang of the consumer, the consumer sentiment, the macro pressures, et cetera, along with a somewhat higher inventory level entering into Q2 than we anticipated, which is directly related to the lower sales than our expectation. So that allows us -- doesn't allow us, forces us to change some of our thinking around gross margin, more inventory, lower gross margin. Now these are not huge changes, but they're material in the plan. So now you've got fewer sales, a little bit less gross margin, and as a result, we have to be prudent. We believe will be included on the SG&A line and the interest lines. So interest being one of those things that we've talked a little bit about. Interest is going to be slightly higher, somewhat higher than we anticipated because, again, sales, then leads to inventory, which then leads to debt, which then leads to interest, and debt and money has a cost now. So, we're managing all those things. We put them together. I think this is a prudent way to approach the guidance.\nOperator: Our next question is from Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.\nCristina Fernandez: I wanted to ask about your view of the industry with a lot of the brands and retailers already having reported. What is your view as far as the inventory in the marketplace, how long would all take inventory to normalize in the level of promotions, where do you see the now versus pre-pandemic?\nJared Briskin: Christine, it's Jared. I think that from an expectation perspective, I think we felt fairly confident that by the second -- by the midway point of this year, a lot of the promotional environment from an industry perspective would be a lot better. I think since that point, the consumer health has certainly changed and specifically for our industry. Their focus has narrowed significantly around what they're engaging with, what they're going to purchase. So that I think, as I called out in my commentary, I think that moves the line at least through the end of the third quarter, where I would expect that we'll see significant promotions, but it could be longer than that, depending on what happens with the consumer through the rest of the year. But recently, we've seen significantly more promotions in the marketplace, which certainly indicates to us that the cleanup of the industry as a whole could take a little bit longer than we were expecting.\nCristina Fernandez: And then my second question is around the cost-cutting initiatives across the organization. Last call, you talked about SG&A reigning that in. Can you give more color and update of where you are in your cost-cutting initiatives? And anything incremental you're doing now based on the lower sales outlook?\nMike Longo: Yes. Thank you. And we did talk about that last time. We brought it up this time. It is a systematic review. We're relatively early in it, but it has yielded some results, some of that contributed to the SG&A, but there are other reasons for the SG&A leverage in Q1 that are called out in the press release. But I think it is also worth noting that those investments that we've made over the past few years are bearing fruit and some of it in SG&A. So Ben, you want to speak to some of the things that you're doing?\nBenn Knighten: As Mike mentioned, we have invested in the business over the last few years and particularly in respect to the mobile environment, a mobile platform at a store level. That's helped us in a couple of things. Obviously, enhanced experience inside the store, very similar to our experience on the web and bringing the omnichannel in the store, but it's also allowed us to become more productive and more engaged with -- more engagement between our associates and our consumers. That's allowed us to take some of the cost out of the business, quite honestly, from a labor perspective at store level, and we become more productive. And we've accelerated some of those efforts. We've got more on the table, but really through those investments over the last few years, allow us to kind of push that a little bit.\nBob Volke: Kristina, this is Bob. Just to kind of finish that kind of thought off. One of the things we are still dealing with as much as we are working actively to reduce some kind of ongoing structural costs within the organization, also taking advantage periodically of some discretionary opportunities to reduce spend. But one thing we can't forget about is as we have obviously lowered our revenue guidance, there is still real inflation affecting wages and the goods and services that we need to support the organization. So as much as we are doing right at the moment, I think this is going to pay bigger dividends into future years. But this year, still a little bit under pressure from a leverage standpoint, again, just because we've got that tough sales environment as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Kleber with Baird. Please proceed.\nJustin Kleber: It's Justin Kleber. Jared, I wanted to follow up on the promotional environment. Last year, we're talking about Apparel and now it's Footwear. So just can you talk about where the Footwear promotions are concentrated? Is it just broad-based outside of the launch product? And then is this really are you guys driving promotions? Or are you simply responding to what some of your competitors are doing in the marketplace?\nJared Briskin: Yes. Thanks, Justin. It's actually both. As we talked a lot in the back half of last year, we moved and we were very focused on getting our Apparel seasonally appropriate, getting Apparel cleaned up, getting to the right inventory level and we accomplished all that. We feel good about where our Apparel inventory is today, although Apparel continues to be under significant pressure from a sales standpoint, just due to the consumer environment and general trends. So our focus now has shifted on the Footwear side. It's not as simple as just launch and non-launch. There are many products that are not launched that we would consider to be highly scarce and high that are still performing extraordinarily well. But some of the secondary franchises, tertiary franchises, secondary brands has really been a significant slowdown. So some of our promotional engagement has been a response from a marketplace perspective, but some of it's also been a deterioration in what we saw at the back end of the first quarter and our ability to really obviate some of that inventory. So it's a combination of both.\nJustin Kleber: Okay. Bob, can you help me a bit on the gross margin. If I look at your first quarter gross margin rate, it's always been above the full year rate by at least 100 basis points, if not more, outside of the calendar '20 with the pandemic and stores being closed. But your full year gross margin guide this year, it's above what you just delivered in the first quarter despite more promotions and you have occupancy that's going to flip to a headwind given the comp outlook. So why would that be the case?\nBob Volke: Yes. I think, again, we kind of feel like with the heavy promotional environment in the first half of the year, we think that's going to drag down margins for that first two quarters, but then there's some lift coming in the back half of the year. Again, harder to predict exactly how quickly or how significant that lift will be, but the goal is that as inventory gets cleaned up, again, Jared touched on this earlier, less need to promote and reduce price in the back half of the year. The other thing is we are starting to get some other leverage in terms of our freight and logistics operations costs, so that's helping to offset some of the pure product margin headwinds that we're dealing with. So again, it's kind of like we feel like we're kind of dealing with a little bit heavier kind of challenge in the first part of the year and hopefully get some lift, like I said, as the year goes on. So that's the thinking as we look at the full year outlook.\nJustin Kleber: Okay. That's helpful. Last question, just on new stores. Can you guys just comment given the environment, I mean, how new stores are performing? Or are they hitting your internal hurdle rates? I mean does it make sense to slow the pace of store growth until the environment, I guess, returns to some form of normal, whatever that's going to look like into next year?\nJared Briskin: Justin, it's Jared. Obviously, we continue to look at this in great detail. And our stores are performing exceptionally well. So, we still see it as a real strong use of capital. New store performance along with remodels along with new storefront signs, are having a really significant payout on our investments. So, we do not plan at this point to slow the growth down that we've already committed to.\nOperator: Our last question is from John Lawrence with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed.\nJohn Lawrence: Jared, would you talk a little bit about that basket, I mean, in normal times without this pressure, somebody picks up a pair of shoes and maybe the attach rate for apparel. Can you just talk about how that's changed from a basket perspective? Or is somebody just waiting for a promotion on the apparel side? Or just dive into that a little bit, please.\nJared Briskin: Yes, John. We're seeing it go down some. I mean, obviously, our teams continue to focus on products that connect and continue to deploy our toe-to-head strategy which we still believe is the right strategy. Some of those opportunities around those connected outfits are now happening over multiple transactions. But at the same time, the primary driver of the business is footwear, the average retail price of footwear has skyrocketed over the last few years, and that's putting a lot of pressure on apparel. So, we are absolutely seeing less apparel being sold in conjunction with footwear in the current environment.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nMike Longo: Well, again, thank you for being here today. We appreciate it. None of these results were according to our expectations. You've heard everything we had to say about our business model, and we believe in it. So, again, we appreciate it, and we hope everyone has a safe, long weekend and celebrate Memorial Day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."
