At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ prepared remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Harrison Masters, Director of Invest Relations. Please go ahead.\nHarrison Masters: Good afternoon, and welcome to nCino's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me on today's call are Pierre Naude, nCino's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Orenstein, Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Glover, President and Chief Revenue Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, strategies, and the anticipated performance of our business. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and expectations, entail certain assumptions made as of today's date, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and other publicly available documents, the financial services industry, and global economic conditions. nCino disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Further, on today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC before this call, as well as the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investor.ncino.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.\nPierre Naude: Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss our strong finish to a challenging year. We are very pleased to close fiscal ‘24 with the strongest gross sales quarter we've had in the past 10 quarters, increasing 23% over the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23. We saw strength across all US customer segments and from outside US as well, driving 16% subscription revenues growth for the quarter. We believe our Q4 results reflect a return to more normal buying patterns and behavior, including from our US enterprise customers, which we saw disproportionately impacted by the liquidity crisis last year. The improving tone from customers is also a positive indicator. Our confidence in the rebound, along with our expectations for lower churn this year drives our plan for net sales in fiscal ‘25 to be roughly 50% higher than fiscal ‘24. Despite the macro headwinds, full year subscription revenues in fiscal ‘24 increased 19% year-over-year. I couldn't be more proud of the solid execution of the global nCino team. Through the difficult environment, we remain focused on our customers and on product innovation, demonstrating our loyalty and commitment to them through the inevitable business cycles. Customer relationships are at the center of the nCino culture. The opportunity to expand these partnerships with new products and technology is one of the many reasons we are so excited about the road ahead. A more normal buying cycle and the improving tone from customers follows almost four years of industry upheaval between COVID and unprecedented rise in interest rates and the liquidity crisis. During this time, nCino generated a 41% subscription revenues CAGR and transformed from posting a $14 million non-GAAP operating loss in fiscal ‘21 to generating non-GAAP operating income of $62 million in fiscal ‘24. The success reflects the value of our unique platform and strategy, which has created a durable business that can grow and be profitable in any economic environment. An obvious question is why we saw such a strong rebound in Q4 sales and the improved customer behavior. In short, interest rates stabilized, which provided customers the opportunity to focus more on moving forward the strategic investments in light of increased confidence in the business environment and greater visibility into economic trends. Throughout fiscal 24, we discussed the strong demand we were seeing in the market, with the Federal Reserve indicating it has largely finished raising rates. We saw customers ready to close on pending deals. Even after the sales success in Q4, we entered fiscal ‘25 with a strong pipeline which has helped us carry momentum into this year. Before we discuss the factors behind our optimism for the current year and beyond, I wanted to briefly review some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and from fiscal ‘24. First, let's discuss mortgage. Despite the mortgage turmoil leading to unprecedented churn, full-year US mortgage subscription revenues grew by 14%, with Q4 being our best mortgage gross sales quarter of the year. Our success in the fourth quarter was driven largely by selling into banks and credit unions. Of the 21 new mortgage customers signed in the fourth quarter, 13 were FIs. For 12 of these customers, mortgage was the landing point for nCino within the institution. We again saw solid growth internationally in the fourth quarter, which will now represent 20% of total revenues. EMEA remains our largest market outside of the United States, where in the fourth quarter, we added our first enterprise bank in the Nordics, a new logo in South Africa, and a new UK platform customer for our commercial lending, mortgage, and NIC solutions. We also continued our momentum in Japan, announcing another Japanese customer a few weeks ago that signed with us in the fourth quarter for mortgage. We continued innovating to expand the capabilities of the platform, unlocking more wallet share opportunities with our installed base which contributed to more multi-product wins in the fourth quarter. Josh will cover some of these wins in more detail in his comments. Let's turn to NIC and AI, looking both at our progress in fiscal ‘24 and the accelerating opportunity we see in fiscal ‘25 and beyond. For nCino, AI starts with our NIC products, which we've been developing for almost five years. We have seen strong traction across all three products currently in the NIC portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we added our largest auto-spreading deal outside of the United States, which follows signing our largest portfolio analytics deal last quarter. NIC demonstrated our initial success in utilizing an unmatched data assets to provide intelligence and actionable insights at the point of production across our single platform. Now we are taking the next step with banking advisor, which already has early adopters. Banking advisor leverages Generative AI to further automate banking specific tasks. The opportunity for AI in banking can't be overstated. A recent Accenture study concluded that banks are likely to benefit more from Generative AI than any other industry. To truly benefit, financial institutions need nCino's single platform to surface data at the point of production to drive the actionable insights and intelligence that differentiate a bank and improve the customer experience. Obviously, it is early in the AI lifecycle, but with our unique perspective on industry demand drivers, we believe the opportunity for AI in banks is not hype, it's real. Banking advisor and our other NIC offerings are examples of our continued emphasis on expanding the breadth and depth of our product offerings. Since the beginning, nCino's single platform has addressed a variety of pain points, including the need to grow revenues, attract the best talent, meet regulatory demands, improve the customer experience, and increase efficiency. While the relative importance of the individual capabilities varies over time, customer feedback points to efficiency is currently the most important driver. Becoming more efficient is critical in any economic environment. It's a business input an organization can control. Of course, the importance of AI ties directly to this demand. At the same time, the continued pressure on net interest margins can only be mitigated by improved efficiency. Our single platform allows nCino to be part of the solution as FIs look to consolidate vendors and streamline operations. As the only platform that can work with small community banks, credit unions, and independent mortgage banks, all the way to the largest institutions across the globe, the value of our solution becomes more and more clear all the time. The nCino platform provides commercial, small business, consumer lending, including mortgage, account opening, and onboarding from one trusted partner on a single platform that is embedded with AI, actionable insights, data and intelligence. nCino helps FIs act like fintechs, leveraging the lower cost of capital with the ease of use and personalized experience consumers have come to expect from fintechs. Our new omnichannel experience for consumer lending is also an answer of early adopters. A lesson from the liquidity crisis last year that has sunk in all too well is the need to extend relationship banking through digital channels to create a more enjoyable user experience for the consumer and to reduce costs for financial institutions. While online banking has been around for decades and consumers' interactions with their financial institutions frequently occur through an app today, middle and back office processes for consumers have remained far from automated. The consumer-facing technology leveraged from our nCino Mortgage Suite creates a consistent experience for consumers across mortgage and spectrum of consumer lending products offered in today's market. nCino omnichannel connects seamlessly to our platform through proprietary APIs, fully digitizing the process, beginning with the application. The release of this functionality is already driving significant pipeline development for both our consumer lending and mortgage solutions. Subsequent to year-end, we took an additional step to accelerate expanding our platform capabilities with a tuck-in acquisition. Last week, we announced the acquisition of DocFox, which provides technology for commercial account opening and onboarding, including robust KYC and AML functionality. Utilizing DocFox eliminates paperwork, reducing the time required for onboarding complex commercial accounts from months to days. The acquired technology provides complementary functionality and again allows us to capture greater wallet share within our installed base. I can't overemphasize the asset that is in our customer base as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our product capabilities and value proposition. Our initial focus will be on bringing DocFox to our community bank customers, refining our go-to market and implementation motions in this market, as we usually do with new products. After demonstrating success within the community market, we'll begin targeting our entire commercial and small business customer base. Greg will review our financial outlook, but I want to note that we are trying to be prudent in our guidance despite our optimism about the improving trends. Even with a strong finish to the year, the difficult first quarter of fiscal ‘24, which stemmed from the liquidity crisis paired with the unprecedented churn that we believe peaked in the second half of last year, does create difficult compares for much of the year. Understanding our success, increasing profitability, subscription revenues growth remains our primary objective. We are confident the strength of year-end sales and the improving macro trends we see puts us on track to exceed 15% subscription revenue growth in FY ‘26. In addition, we remain on track to achieve the Rule of 50 as highlighted during our Investor Day in September. Before I turn the call over to Josh to review the operational highlights of the quarter, I want to speak briefly about two organizational changes. First, our Chief Product Officer, Matt Hansen, has informed me that following a number of professional successes, including founding SimpleNexus in 2011, integrating it with nCino, following the acquisition in January 2022, and delivering exemplary results over the last two years leading our product development engineering organization, he has made the decision to leave nCino to spend more quality time with his family. We are grateful for Matt's contributions and the leadership of various change initiatives, including the launch of the omnichannel experience, monthly product releases, evolving how work is done across PD&E and the significant productivity improvements during his tenure will have an ongoing impact on our success. Matt will remain with nCino in a consulting capacity until August to help ensure a smooth transition. Sean Desmond, currently our Chief Customer Success Officer, has been named Chief Product Officer effective May 1. Sean's extensive background in technical management and product development, his customer-centric approach and his proven ability to build meaningful relationships and lead complex organizations will help ensure the continued evolution of our solutions and our PD&E team. Sean has been a member of nCino's executive leadership team for over 10 years. And his understanding of our business, products, customers, and market needs have prepared him extremely well for this position. Sean has been a key partner and highly collaborative with Matt and PD&E leadership on the change initiatives I just referenced. His customer success organization is well developed and positioned to continue delivering best-in-class service levels to our customers. The other organizational change, as referenced in our earnings release, is that Josh Glover, our President and Chief Revenue Officer, is leaving nCino to pursue an opportunity as President and CRO of a later stage private company outside of the financial services industry. As most of you know, Josh was one of the earliest nCino employees and has been at my side the past 12 years, helping to create the global, profitable growth company we are today. While I'm sorry to see him leave, we all wish him the greatest success as he pursues a new challenge and expands his professional experience beyond nCino. Josh will continue with nCino in a consulting capacity until June 30th to help ensure a smooth transition. Paul Clarkson, who has been leading global sales with Josh's organization and has deep knowledge of our business, customers and the markets we serve, has been named Executive Vice President, Global Revenue. We're excited for Paul to take on this increased responsibility as promoting from within has long been part of nCino's success. At this time, we do not plan to fill the President role as we believe those responsibilities can be shared amongst the executive leadership team members. With that, I will turn the call over to Josh to review some of the operational highlights from the quarter.\nJosh Glover: Thank you, Pierre. As I'm sure you can appreciate, I've given the decision to leave nCino a great deal of thought. It's never easy to leave a place where you've invested so much of yourself and where you so highly value the people, the friends that you work with. With a mature global go-to-market and sales organization well in place and with interest rates stabilizing and the liquidity crisis behind us, it feels like now is the right time for me to pursue a new challenge. I will always be nCino's biggest supporter, and I look forward to watching the company's continued success. I particularly look forward to watching some of my closest colleagues and friends as they step up to take on additional responsibilities and receive well-earned professional opportunities. I've enjoyed getting to know all of you over the years and I hope to get to work with you again down the road. With that said, let's turn to the strong Q4 results. We are very pleased with the way our sales team finished the year. Our existing customer base continues to be nCino's most strategic asset. About 60% of the business signed in the fourth quarter came from upsells and cross-sells to our existing base. We saw multi-year extensions across the entire business with expanded commitments from 29 institutions in US banking segments in EMEA, APAC, and Canada. In the fourth quarter, we signed a seven-figure expansion agreement for small business at a top 50 US bank and another for deposit account opening in the top 100 US bank. Reinforcing our successful delivery of the single platform, half of the new business signed in the quarter came from solutions other than commercial lending. NIC adoption also increased. 39% of our platform base has now adopted at least one NIC solution. This is up from 30% at the end of last year. As part of their initial commitment to nCino, an over $4 billion bank in Texas selected us for commercial, small business, and consumer lending, as well as commercial pricing and profitability, automated spreading, and portfolio analytics. Also, an over $8 billion dollar bank in Ohio selected nCino for commercial and small business lending, as well as auto spreading and portfolio analytics. Customers are telling us more now than ever that financial institutions need to realize efficiencies by consolidating operations and data on to a single trusted platform. With the new offerings we're bringing to the market and the acquisition of DocFox, we expect to see even deeper adoption of the single platform within our accounts. This platform is being embraced by more than just US customers. During the fourth quarter, we completed one of our largest automated spreading agreements. This was with a top 10 Canadian financial institution, Desjardins. Desjardins began their digital lending journey with nCino with small business banking that expanded to their commercial banking line of business and has now selected us for auto spreading. Also in the quarter, a top UK non-bank lender selected nCino as the digital lending platform across all of their core products, presidential and [indiscernible] mortgages, commercial loans, bridging finance, and development funding. Other notable wins outside of the US included a Japanese regional bank win with the Saikyo Bank for mortgage, our first enterprise bank in the Nordics, and a top 10 South African bank. Notably, in Canada, we added another two top 20 Canadian credit unions, and we added another top 10 Canadian banks. We now have six of the top 10 Canadian financial institutions on the nCino platform. Our continued investment in the platform has become a major differentiator for us in the market. The product announcements over the last several quarters, including the launch of banking advisor, automated insights for portfolio analytics, our omni-channel experience for consumer lending, and the acquisition of DocFox revolve around three key innovation themes you have heard us discuss many times, automation, intelligence, and experience. As Pierre mentioned, a recent publication from Accenture concluded that banking is likely to be more profoundly impacted by Generative AI than any other industry based on the potential for automation and augmentation. As of this call we have three early adopters representing the US enterprise, US community banking segments plus an international bank using several banking advisor skills. One of those skills is credit memo narratives, which leverages Generative AI to automate the creation of a credit memo, a required and complex deliverable in every commercial loan that is used when making a lending decision. We have additional skills already in development that will be in the market later this year, bringing even more actionable intelligence to the point of production, where it can influence positive business outcomes for the financial institution. These use cases include layering Generative AI into commercial pricing and profitability and into our priority manager feature. Given the shape of anticipated demand and adoption for Generative AI, our intent is to monetize with a platform fee paired with consumption-based fees and also to drive intelligence across our various solutions. We look forward to demonstrating many of these new features and enhancements at nSight in May. We hope to see many of you there as well to see these innovations and to see nCino's vibrant ecosystem in person. Product enhancements aimed at experience have been driving market momentum for our mortgage suite. An over $30 billion regional bank, who previously adopted nCino across consumer and commercial lending, went live on our mortgage suite in the fourth quarter. We're glad to hear the differentiated experience of one borrower. The customer was able to apply for their mortgage at less than 10 minutes on their phone while walking their dog. This bank is well on their way to realize and exceed their business case for the solution by transitioning significant application volumes of digital channels and realizing a commensurate reduction and abandonment rates, bringing them well ahead of industry average. The fourth quarter is our best sales quarter for US mortgage in fiscal ‘24, adding 21 new logos for mortgage point of sale. These 21 new customers included one of the largest IMBs in the nation, a takeaway from competitor and one of the largest deals in our mortgage team's history. The 13 new financial institution customers added also validate the benefit of our efforts to continue integrating and aligning our go-to-market teams to leverage nCino's brand and presence across the finest financial institutions in the United States. The reshuffle of mortgage loan officers throughout the latest cycle has been one of our best sources of demand generation. Past users of nCino's mortgage solutions evangelize the product to the new employer and become vocal internal advocates as we pursue those accounts. And mortgage lenders look to implement our market leading solutions to proactively compete for talent. While churn for market consolidation remained elevated in the quarter, we are confident that the share gains throughout this cycle paired with continued product development efforts will yield accelerating growth as the mortgage market normalizes. I am proud of how the company came together to support sales efforts in the fourth quarter. The strength of our team and competitive positioning makes me optimistic for a strong fiscal ‘25 and beyond. Greg, can you please take us to the financials?\nGreg Orenstein: Thank you, Josh, and thank you for your friendship and partnership over the past 8.5 years. While I will miss working with you, I know it's time for you to take on a new challenge and I wish you the very best. With that, thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon to review our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 financial results. Please note that all numbers referenced in my remarks are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise stated. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC just before this call. We are pleased with our fourth quarter fiscal ‘24 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $123.7 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. Full-year total revenues were $476.5 million, an increase of 17% over fiscal ‘23. Subscription revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘24 were $107.5 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Subscription revenues were 87% of total revenues. Full year subscription revenues were $409.5 million, an increase of 19% over fiscal ‘23 and 86% of total revenues for the year. Professional services revenues were $16.2 million in the fourth quarter, a slight decrease year-over-year. Full year professional services revenues were $67.1 million, an increase of 6%. As I noted on our third quarter earnings call and at Investor Day, we intend to prioritize subscription revenues growth over professional services revenues growth on our path towards the Rule of 50. In the fourth quarter we continued to invest in our SI partner ecosystem and in implementation repetitions for newer products which impacted the number of billable hours. We also faced a difficult year-over-year comparison in professional services from our portfolio analytics business, where the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23 contributed an additional $1.2 million of professional services revenue related to meeting the CECL implementation deadline. Non-US revenues were $24.8 million or 20% of total revenues in the fourth quarter, up 48% year-over-year. Revenues from outside the US were $89.3 million or 19% of total revenues for the full year, up 45% year-over-year. As you are aware, international is one of our key growth pillars and we are very pleased to see this continued growth outside the United States. We believe our global footprint, which just grew with the new office in South Africa from the DocFox acquisition, is truly unique amongst vertical financial services SaaS companies. Non-GAAP gross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘24 was $81.7 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 66% compared to 65% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23. Non-GAAP gross profit for the full year was $313.1 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the full year was 66% compared to 65% in fiscal ‘23. Our gross margins improved due to subscription revenues being a larger contributor to total revenues. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘24 was $19.3 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter was 16% compared with 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23. Non-GAAP operating income for the full year was $61.8 million compared with a non-GAAP operating loss of $2.1 million for fiscal ‘23. Our non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal ‘24 was 13% compared with negative 1% in fiscal ‘23. We realized efficiencies across the organization in fiscal ‘24 while remaining committed to continuous product innovation, delivering the highest levels of customer satisfaction, and building out our global market presence. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘24 was $23.8 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino for fiscal ‘24 was $58 million or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to negative $8 million or negative $0.07 per basic and diluted share in fiscal ‘23. The company received an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter from releasing a valuation allowance against a UK deferred tax asset, which contributed $3.7 million to both GAAP and non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino in the quarter. Our remaining performance obligation increased to over $1 billion as of January 31, 2024, up 9% from $944.1 million as of January 31, 2023, with $675.4 million in the less than 24 months category, up 6% from $634.8 million as of January 31, 2023. RPO was positively impacted by the strength of gross sales, coupled with a very strong renewal quarter. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $117.4 million, including restricted cash. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $8.1 million, compared to negative $22 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘23. Capital expenditures were $400,000 in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow of $7.7 million in the fourth quarter, marking the first year in company history with positive free cash generation in every quarter of a fiscal year. Moving on to DocFox, we closed this acquisition on March 20th with the $75 million purchase price paid in cash at closing. We leveraged our expanding revolving credit facility to help fund this transaction and intend to pay down the borrowed principal throughout the year as we continue to generate cash. Financial results of DocFox will be consolidated from the date of acquisition for reporting in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2023, DocFox had approximately $6 million of annualized subscription revenues. We ended fiscal ‘24 with over 1,800 customers, down from 1,858 at the end of fiscal ‘23, due to the churn we have discussed all year within the independent mortgage bank market. 501 of these customers contributed greater than $100,000 to fiscal ‘24 subscription revenues, an increase of 8% from the end of fiscal ‘23. Of these 501 customers, 86 contributed more than $1 million to fiscal ‘24 subscription revenues, an increase of 18% from the end of fiscal ‘23. We ended fiscal ‘24 with 460 platform customers, up from 428 at the end of fiscal ‘23. Our subscription revenue retention rate for fiscal ‘24 was 117%, down from 148% in fiscal ‘23 or 125% if you exclude the inorganic contribution from the SimpleNexus acquisition. Churn for fiscal ‘24 was approximately $31 million, in line with the revised expectations provided on our Q3 earnings call. Before we turn to our fiscal ‘25 financial guidance, let me provide some commentary around our outlook for the year in addition to Pierre's earlier comment about the negative impact of first quarter fiscal ‘24 sales as a result of the liquidity crisis. First and most noteworthy, we entered fiscal ‘25 with a subscription revenues headwind of approximately $31 million as a result of the heightened churn that occurred in fiscal ‘24, a significant amount of which we consider to be outside the [Technical Difficulty] Apologies. It seemed like we were having some technical difficulties. So let me take a few lines back and we'll start over. Appreciate your patience. First and most noteworthy, we entered fiscal ‘25 with a subscription revenues headwind of approximately $31 million as a result of the heightened churn that occurred in fiscal ‘24, a significant amount of which we consider to be outside the normal course of our business. Specifically, $13 million was related to the turmoil in the US mortgage market, $2.5 million was attributable to a customer directly impacted by the liquidity crisis, and $4 million represented the remainder of PPP licenses. The financial impact of this churn, even when netted against the contribution from the DocFox acquisition, results in a 3% headwind to fiscal ‘25 subscription revenues growth. Turning to mortgage, our US mortgage subscription revenues grew 10% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘24 and 14% for the full year. We are very proud of this achievement in what was a very difficult mortgage market. For fiscal ‘25, we are modeling $8 million in mortgage churn, which, while still elevated from historic levels, is $5 million less than last year, but otherwise modeling minimal improvement in the US mortgage market until the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘25. We expect our US mortgage business will be dilutive to the company's overall subscription revenues growth rate for full year fiscal ‘25 in light of the fiscal ‘24 churn. We expect our total company churn in fiscal ‘25 to decrease to approximately $20.5 million or 5% of fiscal ‘24 subscription revenues and that churn will continue to moderate towards historic norms beyond this year as the mortgage market continues to normalize. On the cost side, we were pleased to announce an extension to our long-standing agreement with Salesforce in December that took effect at the start of fiscal ‘25. In addition to deepening the commitment between our two product organizations, we expect the more favorable unit economics provided by the agreement to contribute an approximately 1% improvement in our non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal ‘25 and then contribute further incremental improvements in our non-GAAP gross margin in future years. This agreement provides us with even more confidence in our ability to deliver on the 78% to 80% subscription gross margin long-term target announced at Investor Day. You will note our guidance for fiscal ‘25 assumes continued progress on non-GAAP operating income with a $22 million to $24 million or 36% to 39% improvement year-over-year. We plan to continue prudently investing, particularly in R&D and sales and marketing, to drive subscription revenues growth in light of the significant opportunity we see ahead including with our NIC AI data and analytics products. We remain confident in the long-term operating model targets we shared at our Investor Day in September. As I have previously stated, progress towards those targets will not be linear. And as a reminder, the 15% implied subscription revenues growth target in our long-term model is not a CAGR, but rather expected growth for that year. Finally, our plan assumes approximately $8.5 million of capital expenditures, most of which is for improvements to and expansion of our office in the UK. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect total revenues of $126 million to $127 million, with subscription revenues of $108.75 million to $109.75 million. This guidance assumes year-over-year subscription revenues growth of 12% to 13%. As Pierre noted, churn in fiscal ‘24 peaked in the second half of the year. Specifically, mortgage churn peaked in October and total churn peaked in the fourth quarter, making the first three quarters more difficult comparisons. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter is expected to be approximately $18 million to $19 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share to be $0.13 to $0.14. This is based upon a weighted average of approximately 117 million diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal ‘25, we expect total revenues of $538.5 million to $544.5 million, with subscription revenues of $463 million to $469 million. This full-year guidance assumes year-over-year subscription revenues growth of 13% to 15%. As you will note, the 13% high end of our first quarter subscription revenues guidance is the low end of our full year subscription revenues guidance. We expect our highest year-over-year and sequential growth to occur in the fourth quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating income for fiscal ‘25 to be $84 million to $86 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share is expected to be $0.60 to $0.64 based upon a weighted average of approximately 118 million diluted shares outstanding. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah, good afternoon, everybody. First, I did want to say, Josh, I guess congratulations and good luck with the new opportunity we'll miss you. And I'm sure you're going to miss our great questions. I guess my first question, and then I have a follow-up is on the enterprise side. Pierre, I think you were talking about enterprise demand normalizing. I guess is it starting to shift or pivot in terms of some of the products they're looking at? In particular, I'm wondering, are you seeing green shoots for these larger transformational commercial loan origination deals, which typically were much larger, or is it really a lot of the other products in the diversification playing out? And then I have a follow-up.\nPierre Naude: Yeah, I would say -- thanks a lot Terry. I would say that the larger banks is returning to more of a strategic posture, which means they are beginning to look at larger transformations. It's very early on in the buying cycle, but most of the actual activity is on the non-loan origination or non-commercial loan origination systems. So it sinks under than commercial loan origination. And as we always reminded you, we see our customer base as a massive asset to this company. And you can see now how we're beginning to cross sell into them with existing products as these products start scaling and become more attractive to larger banks as well, as well as the community and regional space. You can also see how the DocFox acquisitions meet tremendously accretive to those accounts. That is a critical issue for them, how to deposit account opening and onboarding with a robust KYC and AML functionality. So I think we are proving out the case that our customer base is not a drag, but actually a positive for us.\nTerry Tillman: Got it, thanks for that, Pierre. And I guess my follow-up question is related to the $6 million, Greg. I think you disclosed that that was the annualized subscription revenue. Is that what you're assuming for FY ‘25? And if it's like SimpleNexus, you have some pretty significant revenue synergies. Are you baking anything in there? Thank you.\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah, thanks, Terry. Obviously, we don't break down that detail from a fiscal ‘25 or specific product guidance perspective. But as was noted in the call, we're going to focus on integration and make sure from a product perspective we've got that single platform motion going to market starting in the community base. And so we would expect the momentum to build as the year progresses is how we're looking at that contribution from DocFox.\nTerry Tillman: Okay, thank you.\nGreg Orenstein: Thanks, Terry.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Adam Hotchkiss with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAdam Hotchkiss: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess to start, I just wanted to touch a little bit more on the expansion of your partnership with Salesforce. I appreciate the detail on the model, Greg, but could you just talk a little bit more about what, if at all, is changing on the technology side from an integration perspective. Thanks.\nPierre Naude: Yeah, I'll take that. Thanks, Greg. So the first thing is, we in Salesforce get together with our customers and we always look at opportunities to improve how the platform, which is force.com, and then the CRM functionality, the call center functionality from Salesforce integrate into nCino to make it a seamless experience for the banker. And so on the one hand, Salesforce is expanding some platform elements so that we can integrate easier to it and better. And on top of that, it'll provide a much better client experience. And I always use this example. Think of your iPhone as a platform with a number of apps on there. And if they start sharing data, that makes it just so much more seamless. And although we've had that in the past, we are now taking that to a new dimension where more vertical capabilities of Salesforce becomes available to nCino. So it gives us deeper integration, it gives us more cross-sell opportunities as well as co-sell opportunities. And I'm very optimistic with the product direction of Salesforce and how we piggyback on that, as well as the coordination in the field for us to enlarge our deals.\nAdam Hotchkiss: Okay, great, that's really helpful. And then I just wanted to talk a little bit more about banking advisors, some of the early adopters. How quickly do you think you can realistically ramp adoption of some of these features into the base? And then just any initial thoughts on how you think about the potential ACV uplift for existing customers would be helpful.\nPierre Naude: It's very early stage for banking advisor. We've got early adopters going with it. But in the end, banking advisor is going to be a tremendous productivity tool and it'll be based on obviously the size of the deployment which correlates with the size of the bank. It'll be based on the number of skills. It'll be heavily ROI based because we have to begin to understand how is it complementing specific roles and how it may even replace humans at certain places in the production line. Okay? So, the feedback we're getting right now is very positive, but it's early days. And, Josh, do you want to comment on that?\nJosh Glover: I think what's important to note back to your question about how quickly we can ramp adoption of that. Our early adopters represent pieces of the US enterprise, US community regional and international customers. So this is something we feel will be globally applicable, and that's why we've taken that approach with the innovation. It will be a much faster implementation than an nCino transformation. And that aligns with a lot of our other cross-sale and NIC solutions that you've seen. You've heard us talk about record-setting portfolio analytics deals. Those are also quick to adopt. I think that translates nicely to lots of our customers the problems that we solve and to how quickly we can see a ramp from that.\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah, and Adam, it's Greg just to note, well again, not necessarily breaking down product contribution. I will note, because I think it's important that we're not assuming revenue in fiscal ‘25 from banking advisor. So again, consistent with our rollout model, very methodical, make sure it's battle tested. And ultimately, that's what we're focused on doing this year.\nAdam Hotchkiss: Okay, really helpful. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Sklar with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAlex Sklar: Great. Thank you. The first question is for Pierre, Josh, or Paul, if he's on. But you highlighted some of the fiscal ‘24 issues that impacted growth and I just wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit more on the visibility going to FY ’25, that should drive that comment around 50% greater net bookings. And specifically how should we think about that between kind of improved gross bookings versus improved churn? Thanks.\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah. Hey, Alex. It's Greg. Just on the churn, I think it's a combination of both in terms of, again, improved gross bookings, a little bit more consistent than what we saw last year, particularly in light of the liquidity crisis in Q1, but again, also an expectation as I tried to detail in my prepared remarks around the lower expectation [of the] (ph) churn. And so those two, I think, helped drive that 50% number and some of the confidence that we see going into as the year begins and the pipelines that we have.\nPierre Naude: Yeah, I want to emphasize our capacity on the field has increased year-over-year because we believe there's a massive opportunity and our TAM and SAM supports that. That gross bookings growth along with lesser churn gives us a significant upside on the net bookings.\nAlex Sklar: Okay, and then just a quick follow up. Any way you think about how that should flow into fiscal ‘25 versus fiscal ‘26? Is that mostly a ‘26 issue?\nPierre Naude: Yeah, so if you look at our revenue certainty or visibility as the year starts, we're sitting around 93% to the middle of the guidance, okay? And so what we booked the first half of the year, there's two main factors. It's mix of product, in other words, how quickly it becomes revenue. It will be churned, as we see those indicators, because there's some unknowns in churn always. We've been conservative, but you never know what's going to happen. So those are the two main factors. And can we get the bookings early enough in the year, which -- I'll give you just a rough understanding of, if we can by mid-year have roughly around 40% of our total gross bookings for the year in, that is much more of a normal picture for the year and you get 60% in the back half. That first six months of bookings still impacts this year's P&L. And as you get later to the end of the year, that impacts a lot more into next year's P&L, okay? So that gives you some color how we see. So actually, if you look at this year's financial results, we need to get bookings early and often, and we need to contain churn. And those are the main factors for this year's financials.\nAlex Sklar: Great. Thank you both for that color.\nGreg Orenstein: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Altmann with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks guys. I wanted to ask a question on the mortgage side of the business. It sounds like there is a pretty nice rebound in Q4, but can you maybe just talk about where you're at with the transition to more of a consumption-based model? And going off that, how should we be thinking about the impacts to the model in FY ‘25?\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah, Nick, if you think about the transition to more consumption base, which again has a committed platform fee and then which comes with a specific number of loans for that and then to the extent that there's additional volume we would get upside from that. From a logo perspective, it's about 25% to 30% of our mortgage base, probably a little bit higher from a revenue perspective. And so that's where we are from a transition standpoint. Some customers, again, like the old seat-based model and it works for them and we're comfortable with that. Again, we started this because a lot of customers who were trying to navigate the rise in interest rates came to us and wanted some relief and we agreed to work with them as the market was struggling through that, but again, we wanted upside on the other side and they worked with us for that. So I think we're positioned nicely as volumes come back. That said, if you go back to my prepared remarks, we aren't expecting much improvement in the mortgage market until Q4 of this year. If you look at the MBA statistics, Q3 is where they see a pop. But again, we want to be prudent with our modeling as we think about the business and we think about managing the business. So that's where we are as it relates to the mortgage opportunity.\nPierre Naude: Greg, maybe I can give some further color just so that people understand what the mortgage impact is on the company as a whole. Today, mortgage is about 16% of total revenue. And then if you look at where I would say is your trend and instability is, that is more than the IMB market and that makes up only 11%. Then you look at the overall picture that we said in your press release that mortgage grew 14% year-over-year, which I think with all these headwinds is a fantastic accomplishment, number one. But also you have to understand that the IMB market is only 11% of the total company. So that impact is not massive on the company as a whole. It's painful and I want to see it change. But overall, this company has got a financial and a business model that is way beyond mortgage and much stronger to support certainty for us as we make these projections.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nGreg Orenstein: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. It's [indiscernible] for James. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to follow up on Nick's question on mortgage. It sounds like you're modeling minimal improvement in the market throughout the year, even though the business grew 14% on a subscription basis, in a market that was down quite meaningfully in ‘23. If we, Greg, you alluded to this, if we look at some of the industry estimates, it looks like on an aggregate basis for ‘24, we're going to see about a 20% to 30% year-over-year growth relative to ‘23. So, granted a lot of that will be concentrated in the back half, but I'm curious if you could just walk through the rationale for minimal improvement in the mortgage business in fiscal year ‘25 and whether or not that could prove to be conservative. Thanks.\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah, thanks, Michael. So only a couple of things. One is, again, we want to be prudent with our model and our guidance and forecasting. We launched last year a plan and six weeks into it, Silicon Valley Bank happened and so we're sensitive to that. From a year over year growth perspective, again, the churn that we identified in the mortgage side of fiscal ‘24, you see the impact of that really in fiscal ‘25. And so as we think about year-over-year growth, that's a big drag on that business. That said, again, I think the team's done a great job navigating through with the 14% year-over-year growth and 10% in the fourth quarter. And as I've said before, I think one of the focus areas was aligning with the larger, more successful IMBs, if you look at that part of that business. And as the dust is settling, again, I think you're left with a smaller number of larger, better capitalized IMBs. And again, we've worked hard to support those. And as volumes come back, and we expect to benefit from that. The other thing from a mortgage perspective, if you go back to Josh's comments earlier around sales in Q4, the number of financial institutions that were cross-selling and not only just cross-selling but are actually bringing nCino into the financial institution again is another part that should bring some stability to that business as we get through the year. Net of it is, we want to be prudent and I think there's a debate about when interest rates are going to go down and the impact of that on mortgage rates. And I think we're probably taking a view of it happening a little bit later in the year than maybe some other people.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate that, Greg. Makes sense. For my second question, I'm curious if you could give us a status update just in terms of how the synchronization of the SimpleNexus front end to the rest of the retail lending offering is going. When do you expect to complete that, and how do you think that will ultimately impact adoption of the product more generally, particularly after last quarter's win on the retail side? Thanks.\nPierre Naude: Yeah, so as you could hear, the number of banks or financial institutions we're selling that front end to now is increasing, and that velocity or momentum is good. At our nSight user conference, which is in May, we will demonstrate the end-to-end product. It will come with fully developed APIs, and we are very excited about that. I can tell you with vendor consolidation and the platform approach we've taken, we just see a significant, what I would say, interest in this platform because it gives the big banks the ability to do their own front end, and it gives through the APIs, and it gives the smaller banks the ability to adopt the platform end-to-end, okay? And now you throw in the DocFox acquisition, which is going to cover -- the SimpleNexus will cover your consumer and individual oriented businesses and use cases. And then you bring in DocFox and you cover your deposit account opening and onboarding for the commercial side and the heavy complex side. So I just think that this piece of the puzzle is coming together. DocFox will take us six months for the first integration milestone and SimpleNexus will be after our nSight conference in May. It'll be fully in the market and we'll sell this across the platform.\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah. So, Michael, again, nSight in May. We look forward to showing that to our customer base and prospects there. Again, we're really excited about that technology. Make sure you're there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question, Chris Kennedy with William Blair. Your line is open.\nChris Kennedy: Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Pierre, you talked about at least 15% subscription revenue growth in 2026. Can you just talk about kind of the puts and takes to that number as you sit here today?\nPierre Naude: Yes, so the first thing is, if we accomplish the goals for our bookings for this year that we feel very confident about, if you look at the macroeconomic environment, if you look at customer conversations we're having, et cetera, that is your first foundational milestone to that. The second one is, over the next nine months, we are going to launch a number of new products that is very quick to market, much smaller installation cycles. And I believe that will drive momentum where we actually have a higher ACV number come the end of the year, but it'll translate into revenue growth for next year. So the new products, along with the omnichannel frontend we're launching, along with DocFox being fully integrated, okay, I think all of those, and then you look at mortgage when that recovers, and I do believe there's a point, the rates -- mortgage rates will not come down that much. I think it's more of a point of house prices will reach an equilibrium and that the consumer will realize because of life events they have to move. And if you combine all of those, some of you have turned more to a normal market, that upside in mortgage is going to be significant for us as well. So the combination of all of that, I think will drive a growth rate for next year is north of 15%.\nChris Kennedy: Great. Thanks for that. And then you talked about a churn going back to normal. Do you still think the normal is kind of 2% to 3% going forward? Thanks a lot.\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah, I think it would probably be more towards the 3-ish percent risk just because, again, the IMB piece to it, which is a little bit more volatile. But I think, again, we're taking a step down this year. We still expect elevated churn, as we noted. But ultimately, particularly if you look at the legacy nCino side, it's fairly consistent, so there's no new news there. And as mortgage settles, we would expect to be closer down to that 3-ish percent than where we are last year, and certainly where we are this year -- where we were last year. So, Dave, where we are this year.\nPierre Naude: Yeah, the products we're installing is very sticky. It's long term. These are generational buying decisions. And once banks standardize on this kind of software, they stay on it for a very long time. So, I feel confident that churn rate will come down to that. Over time, as the rest of the business grows as well, you'll find that our mortgage business in banking will grow significantly, which is a much more stable customer base. We love the IMB space. We're going to focus on it and sell that. Two-thirds of mortgages are made there. However, over time, that will become a smaller and smaller portion of the business overall, just because we're outgrown on the other side of the balance sheet.\nChris Kennedy: Understood. Thanks for taking the questions.\nGreg Orenstein: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Trout with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.\nRobert Trout: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks to both of you, and congratulations to Josh as well. My first question, I know we've covered the pricing evolution and the trends that you're seeing on the consumer and mortgage side. With regards to that eventual shift on the commercial side, I know you've said, Greg, that you want to work out all the kinks and everything on the consumer side before you begin to deploy that on the commercial -- to the commercial segment. But with the DocFox acquisition, and as Pierre mentioned, rounding out the pieces of the puzzle, is there any thought to perhaps accelerating that hybrid pricing model transition on the commercial side versus a quarter ago?\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah, thanks Bob. Potentially. Ultimately, the rollout of platform pricing is really a cross-functional and organizational effort and that will play out throughout the year as we get that muscle solidified here internally and are able to do that on a very consistent basis. And so you're right, again, our focus has been on mortgage and on consumer, but ultimately as the year progresses and certainly as we get into next year, we would expect to focus on commercial as well, starting with net new customers and then again as renewals come up, addressing it from a renewal perspective. So it'll be an evolution throughout the year and into next year, but again that's where we're going and again it's really been reinforced as we talked about efficiency here a lot on this call and in the prepared remarks. And again, I think we're making our customers more efficient, which means fewer seats, which means they're also getting more value from our products. And so focusing on that value from the sales standpoint versus the number of seats is the right thing for us to be doing.\nRobert Trout: Thank you, that makes perfect sense. And then my follow up just on the -- very pleased to hear that still on track for the targeted drive to Rule of 50. Within the various levers that you have that will get you there, when you think about the fact that for, let's say three out of the next four quarters, you expect the mortgage segment's growth to be dilutive to the company average before, rebounding in the fourth quarter, but you still very much believe that you'll get the Rule of 50 and you'll hit your gross margin of 78% to 80% and it doesn't have to be linear. So what would be potentially the positively offsetting factors when you have, say, a couple of quarters of weakness in say mortgage or any other?\nGreg Orenstein: I think one of the things that we're really proud about, we talked about the turmoil really that this business and the industry has gone through over the last couple of years between COVID and the rise in interest rates and the liquidity crisis, Bob, we stayed very focused on executing our strategy, both product-wise as well as our geographic footprint. And so, again, I think we've got multiple levers in the business in order to help us or support us on our path to reach that Rule of 50 on that long-term target that we discussed back in September. And it's from mortgage, it's from new products, it's from AI, it's from our consumer lending product being in a place where again, we can sign a $200 billion enterprise bank as we announced in the third quarter. It's the new omnichannel. And so, again, I think it's just been a credit to the team, a lot of focus over the last couple years to position us to be ready and really have this kind of convergence of the market hopefully coming back and settling after the turmoil that we've seen aligning very nicely with the maturing of our products and our go-to-market motion. And so again, I think it really spans products and geographies and I think we've got multiple different levers to help drive growth over the next several years.\nRobert Trout: That's great to hear. Thank you very much, guys.\nGreg Orenstein: Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. This is [JR] (ph) on for Brent. Just a quick clarification for me. I'm wondering if you can quantify how much of this building RPO you would attribute to the enterprise deals that slip from the third quarter versus any other source of uplift. Thank you.\nGreg Orenstein: Thanks, JR. You know, wouldn't get that level of specificity. What I would highlight is as we talked about seeing traction across all kind of market segments, that total RPO really is a reflection of duration. As you're aware, it's those enterprise customers that generally sign the longer contracts. Again, with those enterprise customers signing, it was very much extend and expand with those. And so, that was really what was driving. But I wouldn't highlight one specific deal versus, again, just a strong quarter of gross sales and a strong renewal quarter as part of that. As things came together nicely, very much more in line with what our historic expectations have been versus, again, what we've seen over the prior several quarters where it was much more lumpy than normal.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Makes lot of sense. Thank you.\nGreg Orenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Alex Markgraff with KBCM. Your line is open.\nAlex Markgraff: Hey everyone, thanks for taking my question here. Just wanted to follow up on some of the commentary around normalizing a normalizing sales environment. When you think about the normalization that you've seen so far, really, in the fourth quarter, just curious, I mean, what does that represent versus the, I don't know if I'll call it sort of backlog of paused demand that has built up more recently? That's sort of the first part of it. And then as you think about fiscal ‘25, what is sort of the operating assumption as to how quickly some of that demand sort of resumes and deals are signed?\nJosh Glover: Hey, thank you for the question. This is Josh. I think the biggest shift that we've seen is really the motivation that the customer has as we engage with them. We see a more resounding and consistent focus on efficiency from our customer base than we've seen since we started the company. Look, if you look at last year, you had the market took a shock, but when they've come back and realized that their margins are still compressed and they understand the environment they're in, they're getting more questions about their credit quality. The ability to continue banking but do so more efficiently is something that we're seeing in all segments across the globe. And so obviously you understand the efficiency lift that nCino gives, no team and no ecosystem is better equipped than nCino crew is to deliver that efficiency. That's probably been the biggest change that we've seen. So a big piece when we talk about return to engagement and returning sentiment is a pretty crystal clear focus from the customers we serve on delivering more efficiency.\nAlex Markgraff: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Pierre Naude for closing remarks.\nPierre Naude: Thank you so much, operator. When we founded nCino, our goal was to make our customers successful. That vision hasn't changed. Today, our solutions brings all of our financial institutions' lending, onboarding, and account opening operations onto a single trusted platform. I know of no other truly multi-tenant SaaS company in the financial services industry with a product richness and ability to serve the needs of the largest financial institutions across the globe to community banks, credit unions, and IMBs. nCino had the vision and technology to take banks into the cloud. And now we have the deep domain expertise and unmatched data to help them embrace and leverage AI. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope many of you will be able to attend our annual user conference, nSight, in May to see what's coming next. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great evening."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to nCino's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Harrison Master, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHarrison Masters: Good afternoon and welcome to nCino's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me on today's call are Pierre Naude, nCino's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gregory Orenstein, Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Glover, President and Chief Revenue Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, strategies and the anticipated performance of our business. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and expectations, entail certain assumptions made as of today's date and are subject to various risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and other publicly available documents, the financial services industry and global economic conditions. nCino disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Further, on today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC just before this call as well as the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investor.incno.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.\nPierre Naude: Thank you, Harrison, and thank you for joining us this afternoon to review our third quarter fiscal 2024 performance. We had another solid quarter despite the continued unsettled macroeconomic environment. We exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance with subscription revenues of $104.8 million, up 19% year-over-year, and total revenues of $121.9 million, up 16% year-over-year. Once again, we significantly increased profitability, posting a 17% non-GAAP operating income margin even as we continue to invest in the business, specifically in product innovation. Our positive view of the quarter reflects a number of significant product wins across the platform. In particular, we are very excited to announce signing our first consumer lending deal with an enterprise bank in the United States, an over $200 billion institution. Over the past several quarters, we have been highlighting the progress we have made maturing our consumer lending product, and we view landing this customer for consumer lending as another validation of that momentum as well as of our overall single platform product strategy. We also continued to strike in our U.S. mortgage business. Our financial results reflect double-digit U.S. mortgage revenue growth. Even despite lower volumes of originations and an uptick in IMB churn, driven by generationally high mortgage rates. These results demonstrate the benefit of cross-selling into our installed base of banks and credit unions, the differentiation of our mortgage technology, and we believe the durability of our business model. A pivotal win for our U.S. mortgage business in the quarter came with our first cross-sell to a regional bank in the U.S. that has been using nCino for both consumer and commercial lending. Our market-leading mortgage technology further enhances our ability to grow wallet share in an account once a customer experiences the value of our technology. These wins are the result of having our products available on a single integrated platform, and we are excited to deliver an enhanced omnichannel experience for consumer lending in the spring, further leveraging the technology we acquired in the SimpleNexus transaction. As our first generally available point-of-sale journey beyond mortgage, this offering will empower our consumer lending customers to deliver the exceptional point-of-sale experience we offer for mortgage across a broad spectrum of consumer lending products. We expect this offering to further accelerate sales for both our consumer and mortgage lending solutions. As we continue to innovate and expand the capabilities of the platform, I'm also excited by the AI capabilities being introduced through banking adviser, which leverages our data expertise. Over the past four years, we have been working with our customers to create a large differentiated pool of commercial and consumer banking data, including mortgage data. Today, we are well positioned to provide valuable and actionable insights from data aggregated across our customer base and integrated into our single platform. Access to this data is a powerful enabler and our deep domain expertise is informing our AI strategy. The industry has taken notice of this expertise as evidenced by the over 1,200 people who registered for our initial AI webinar in September. When available early next year, banking adviser will help usher in the next wave of intelligent automation, delivered on a single platform for originating any loan product and opening any account type at critical decision points. Turning to our international business. In Q3, we added our largest customer to date in Japan by signing Yamaguchi Financial Group, YMFG, which occupies a top spot in the sizable regional Japanese banking market, saw an opportunity with nCino to improve the efficiency of their processes and the user experience they offer to their customers through digital transformation, beginning with their mortgage business. We are excited about the large opportunities we see in the Japanese market and are pleased to see our investments over the past few years there bearing fruit. Despite this list of Q3 accomplishments, the selling environment does remain challenged in certain parts of our business. Enterprise banks, in particular, continue to be slower signing deals. And unlike the second quarter, we did see a few deals get pushed out of the third quarter as these customers further evaluate their budgets and the potential impact of an evolving interest rate environment on their business. Over the past few weeks, I have traveled to see customers and prospects across North America and Europe. I've come away from these conversations incredibly energized about our opportunity as their needs align so closely with the value proposition of nCino's single platform and product strategy. We built this company and continue to innovate our technology. So the world's best financial institutions can more efficiently run their operations on a single platform. In this environment, risk reduction and cost savings are paramount, and nCino was proving efficiency and greater security while leveraging data to provide unique insights into our customers' businesses. As the backhoe environment settles down, the institutions leveraging and senior will be better positioned for market share gains, profitability, success and longevity. Our sales pipeline, which remains healthy, reinforces we are on the right path, notwithstanding some lumpiness we have seen this year with enterprise sales opportunities. We are excited to close the year with a strong Q4, positioning nCino for further growth next year and beyond. Now let me turn the call over to Josh to provide additional details on some of the operational highlights of Q3.\nJosh Glover: Thank you, Pierre. We are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued momentum we see in the business. On the sales front, we signed key strategic wins across market segments, geographies and solutions. We added our largest customer to date for consumer lending in this last quarter, signing a $200 billion bank in the United States. This new customer will leverage nCino across all of their consumer lines of business with both in branch and digital workflows to modernize their go-to-market approach. We're extremely proud of the work our product teams have done to enable a best-of-breed consumer lending solution for even the largest banks in the U.S. Also in the quarter, we signed an expansion agreement with an existing regional bank customer for mortgage point of sale, bringing mortgage point of sale, consumer and commercial lending all into a single platform for this over $35 billion bank. This is an exciting proof point for the scalability of our mortgage technology, having passed a rigorous selection process with one of our most sophisticated customers. We expect to deliver exceptional time to value with a quick go live in the fourth quarter. Our thesis that a mortgage point-of-sale offering would resonate in our legacy bank customer base is proving out, with half of the eight new mortgage logos signed in the third quarter belonging to financial institutions. Our mortgage customer base is now 46% financial institutions on a logo basis versus 25% at the time of the acquisition of SimpleNexus. And our mortgage pipeline on a dollar basis is now comprised 60% of financial institutions. As interest rate pressures continue to drive consolidation of the long tail of IMBs in the industry, we are working with existing customers to see them through this downturn but we are aggressively cross-selling into the underpenetrated banking and credit union markets. We continue to see our competitive differentiation of mortgage proven out by the market with two additional competitive takeaways this quarter. We continue seeing success with multi-solution net new deals in the quarter, including a $6 billion bank that selected nCino for commercial lending, portfolio analytics and auto spreading and a community bank that picked nCino for commercial and consumer lending as well as auto spreading. A more streamlined and efficient tech stack is resonating even in the current environment, as banks see vendor consolidation as a way to gain critical efficiencies across their operations. Our pipeline for solutions beyond commercial lending continues to develop, making up half of the total pipeline as of quarter end. Risk management is another key value proposition of our solutions that drove new business in the third quarter. We signed our largest portfolio analytics bank deal to date for commercial real estate stress testing, trend analysis and concentrated risk reporting. We also signed our largest ever portfolio analytics credit union deal this quarter for CECL. Turning to international markets. As Pierre noted, in Japan, our team signed a record deal with Yamaguchi Financial Group, a $150 billion asset bank, making this our largest customer to date in Japan. This opportunity is for a mortgage use case by which prospective homebuyers can apply entirely online, 24 hours a day, replacing a traditional paper process. Jointly, we see a clear expansion path across both corporate and consumer lines of business to help YMFG realize a goal of originating all loan products from a single platform. We are pleased with the receptivity we're seeing in the Japanese market, a SAM opportunity, we size at $1.4 billion. This win represents another critical lighthouse account and is still relatively new and still underpenetrated market for nCino. Lastly, we completed a year seven-figure ACV expansion deal with an existing UKI customer that first signed in fiscal 2019. This opportunity was for corporate and institutional banking, small and medium enterprise banking, commercial pricing and profitability, ESG and end-to-end mortgage origination. While embracing these newer offerings, this bank also extended their commitment with nCino for another five years. Our broad and diverse customer base continues to be an asset, particularly in a complex macro environment. Approximately 60% of our gross ACV bookings in the quarter came from existing customers. With 50% of platform customers now using more than one product and 25% year-over-year growth in NIC adoption by platform customers, I cannot overstate the strategic long-term value of our customer relationships. Looking to the fourth quarter, we remain confident in our ability to execute and are well positioned with ample pipeline coverage for a seasonally high fourth quarter sales performance. Greg, can you take us through the financials?\nGregory Orenstein: Thank you, Josh, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to review our third quarter fiscal '24 financial results. Please note that all numbers referenced in my remarks are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise stated. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC just before this call. To echo Pierre and Josh, I am pleased with our third quarter financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter of fiscal '24 were $121.9 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Subscription revenues for the third quarter were $104.8 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year, representing 86% of total revenues. Professional services revenues were $17.2 million in the quarter, growing 1% year-over-year. Professional services revenue growth was impacted by pressure on bill rates even as utilization from a billable hours perspective improved year-over-year. As I noted during my Investor Day comments, we will continue to focus on leveraging our extensive SI ecosystem to provide professional services to our customers and prioritize subscription over professional services revenues. Non-U.S. revenues were $23.4 million or 19% of total revenues in the third quarter, up 48% year-over-year. Subscription revenues growth outside the United States outpaced respective total revenues growth with particular strength coming from our Australia and New Zealand operations. Non-GAAP gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $81.1 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 67% and compared to 65% in the third quarter of fiscal '23. The gross margin improvement was due to efficiencies realized in our customer support organization while maintaining customer satisfaction ratings of 3.9 or about 98% with 5x the respondents documented versus the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $20.4 million compared with $2.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 17% compared with 2% in the third quarter of fiscal '23. This impressive bottom line performance reflects continued operational discipline and leverage from our business model. Our non-GAAP results this quarter also include approximately $2.8 million of accrual reversals for tax equalization within sales and marketing and for certain employee benefits across the organization. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $16.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to negative $1.4 million or negative $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '23. As I noted during our Investor Day, during the third quarter, we rebranded the SimpleNexus solution to nCino Mortgage, resulting in a change to the trade name useful life. As a result, we recorded accelerated amortization to fully amortize the remaining trade name intangible asset. The effect of this change in estimate for the third quarter was an increase in sales and marketing, amortization expense of $10.1 million or $0.09 per basic and diluted share. The impact of this accelerated amortization expense has been excluded from our non-GAAP results. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million, including restricted cash. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.9 million compared to negative $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Capital expenditures were approximately $600,000 in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow of $5.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal '24. You will note incremental spend on the investments line of our balance sheet and statement of cash flows and related disclosures this quarter for a $2.5 million investment in Rich Data Co, an Australia-based leading AI decisioning platform that helps banks make high-quality lending decisions efficiently and safely. We announced a partnership and reseller arrangement with RDC in February of this year and are proud to cement our relationship with this investment to enable even tighter collaboration between our two organizations. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $917.1 million as of October 31, 2023, and -- compared with $919.2 million as of October 31, 2022, with $627.6 million in the less than 24 months category up 4% from $603.9 million as of October 31, 2022. As you heard from Pierre and Josh, we saw a great validation of our solutions across market segments, products and geographies in the third quarter. Gross bookings in the third quarter were lower than in the second quarter, but we continue to expect gross bookings in the second half of the year to be better in the first half of the year as previously communicated. We did see elevated churn in the third quarter from IMBs in our U.S. mortgage business of approximately $5 million of annualized subscription revenues as some IMB struggled with mortgage rates peaking in October to their highest level in over 20 years. This level of churn exceeded our internal churn forecast by about $2.5 million. Fortunately, despite the rate pressure, we are seeing the top performing originators earn a positive production profit as reported in the latest MBA quarterly mortgage bankers performance report. The mortgage industry has come a long way towards rightsizing for current volumes and with our U.S. mortgage business continuing to take market share and grow revenues despite the interest rate pressure and elevated churn, we believe this business is very well positioned for healthy top line growth for years to come. Churn and down sell for the rest of the business were in line with expectations in the third quarter. But in light of the elevated IMB churn, we are adjusting our churn rate expectation for the full year to about 9% of prior year subscription revenues, up from 6%. Although the outlook for our fourth quarter revenues has been tempered by this heightened churn, we are increasing both the low and high end of our outlook for full year subscription revenues guidance. Please note that this heightened churn rate of 9% also includes the impact of our relationship with one of the three customers that was acquired during the liquidity crisis, ending about nine months before the expiration of their contract which was scheduled to be in May of 2024. This event had a negative impact on deferred revenue of approximately $900,000. Positively, we expect to maintain the other two customers that were acquired and, in fact, have already expanded our relationship into one of the acquiring banks. Turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenues of $123.5 million to $125.5 million, with subscription revenues of $105.5 million to $107.5 million. This guidance assumes year-over-year subscription revenues growth of 15% at the midpoint of our range. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be approximately $15 million to $16 million and non-GAAP loss attributable to nCino per share to be between $0.11 to $0.13 for the fourth quarter. This is based upon a weighted average of approximately 115.5 million diluted shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year '24, we expect total revenues of $476.5 million to $478.5 million, with subscription revenues of $407.5 million to $409.5 million. This full year guidance assumes year-over-year subscription revenues growth of 18% at the midpoint of our range. We are again increasing the range of our full year non-GAAP operating income guidance to $57.5 million to $58.5 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share is expected to be between $0.40 to $0.42 based upon a weighted average of approximately 115 million diluted shares outstanding. With that, we'll open the line up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Hotchkiss of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAdam Hotchkiss: I guess to start, it would be great to get a little bit more color on how customers outside of the independent mortgage banks are responding to the evolving rate environment, in particular, some of the recent movement in rate expectations for next year. Just wondering if you're seeing any initial changes as to how decision-makers are thinking about product prioritization or budgets? And then your comment on incremental scrutiny at the enterprise level, whether that's relation in relation to Q4 or if that's something you think reflects early indications of '24 budgets as well?\nPierre Naude: Yes. Thanks for your question. What we're seeing in the market is that everybody is preparing the moment the rates stabilize to actually come more aggressive to the market and to solutions like ours. We see it in our pipeline. We see it in conversations with the banks. The tentative nature of the buying persona we're seeing today is still because of the uncertainty of the rate environment. And as soon as they see stability in that the banks realized the need for moving forward the transformation projects to actually be competitive. In the short run, we're still seeing that lumpiness in the market. In the enterprise, we're beginning to see some stabilization as that retail deal will show you. We're seeing some great stuff in the pipeline around movement in that market. But again, that final decision-making is a bit slower than what we would like to see. People it's a bit more tentative -- on the other hand, the pipeline is healthy and we feel very good about it.\nAdam Hotchkiss: That's great. Really helpful. And then, Greg, wondering if you could just comment a bit more on the leverage this quarter, it looked like it was both in sales and marketing and R&D in particular. Just wondering where you're seeing the lowest hanging fruit and what you're looking for in terms of investment discipline for '24.\nGregory Orenstein: Yes. Thanks, Adam. Again, as I noted, the team continues to execute well as an organization and really has embraced the shift from just pure growth in prior years to profitable growth. And so we have seen nice leverage across all of our OpEx lines. And we'll continue to focus on that. As we think about next year and again, consistently, we say and we want to reinforce this, that we'll continue to prioritize growth. And as we see opportunities for growth, we're going to make sure our investments are aligned to capture those. Again, we still think it's in the early days of a very large market opportunity for us. We think we've got a unique leadership position, and we want to make sure that we continue to invest in that leadership position, again, across the entire platform. And again, Pierre referenced, and Josh referenced in their comments that consumer lending deal, again, another validation of our platform and ultimately, what our software can do for banks on a global basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Pierre, Josh, maybe this question is for you. First of all, congrats on the consumer lending enterprise when $200 billion is certainly a very big bank. Maybe the question is, could you folks just maybe speak to who nCino is typically replacing in these consumer lending deals? And what do you think is sort of the catalyst for these banks to be considering a replacement at this juncture? Does that make sense?\nJosh Glover: Sure, Saket. I can take that. Yes, that's a bank that's grown a lot. When a bank grows like that, and they realize they want to continue serving the consumer segment at scale, they pull back and make sure they have architectures that will continue to scale with them. A big piece of focus here was pushing more to the digital channel. If you're working with the legacy system as this institution was, it's pretty hard to run an efficient operation if you have an in-house legacy system that's dated, that's inflexible that can evolve with your business. It's hard to add products. It's hard to change business rules. Then you throw a digital channel on top of that. It just won't keep up with the size of that -- with the bank of that size. So for that $200 billion bank, they realized they needed to replace probably three or four systems along the way with the nCino project they'll get an in-branch and digital channel that will be a lot more efficient, allow them to serve that customer base and the way customers expect to be served today. So efficiency is a driver there. Better consolidation is a driver there. They're going to be very well positioned on the other side of a quick project as the economy recovers to compete.\nPierre Naude: I would add, Saket. I think what you'll notice is below the top four banks, the deposit flow towards the big four was an issue through the liquidity crisis. And every bank we talk to as a new renewed focus on the consumer to drive deposits because you average deposit balance of a consumer is much lower. They don't move it for interest rate fluctuations. So what you'll find is there will be a focus on consumers in the future to have a stable and a much broader diversified deposit base going forward. And I think you'll see this across the whole banking sector that they have to reverse that trend of deposit flow to the big four.\nSaket Kalia: Yes. That's super interesting. Greg, maybe for you for my follow-up. I'll preface by saying I know we don't manage the business to RPO. Just since there are so many different drivers in that metric, whether it's duration or mix and others, right, that you can educate us on. But can you just maybe -- just to make sure the question is asked. Can you just speak to some of those moving parts? And how you think about that sequential change in RPO that we saw this quarter?\nGregory Orenstein: Yes. Saket, thanks for noting that we don't manage the business to RPO. We appreciate that. And we've tried to go out of our way to make sure folks understand that. When you think about the different moving parts, you mentioned duration being one. Obviously, with the churn that we noted, that's an impact to RPO as well. Pierre mentioned some of the lumpiness in enterprise, particularly when you think about the over 24-month number. As you know, those contracts with the larger customers are generally longer than the two years the 24 months that we given this to RPO and so that's where you see some of the lumpiness that we've been experiencing throughout the year in light of the macro environment. And then the other thing I'd probably note is just in terms of -- Josh mentioned in his comments, approximately 60% of our gross ACV bookings in the quarter came from existing customers A lot of that is going to be add-on business. Generally, we will align the add-on business to co-term with the agreement that's in place. And so those would generally be in that shorter duration bucket as well. And so those would kind of be some of the moving parts. On the other side, things that we've talked about recently in terms, for example, of how we're structuring our mortgage contracts, right, to take into account some of the growth that we expect as that market stabilizes and ultimately grows again, that's not captured in RPO either as we think about upside opportunities outside of that specific metric. So those are the things that I would kind of highlight to you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Pierre, Greg and Harrison. I guess the first question, and I don't know if this is -- and Josh -- sorry, Josh, I almost forgot you. I don't know if this is for Pierre or Josh. But on the retail or consumer lending side, it does seem like a really important lighthouse win. What I'm curious about is I'm not trying to put you on the spot, 4Q is a seasonally stronger bookings quarter, hopefully. But could we see rapidity here in more large wins in the offing in the near term? Or do you need to kind of get them up and running and they become this kind of referenceable customer. And then from there, we can start knocking them down like Domino's in terms of other large enterprise retail or consumer lending wins? And then I had a follow-up.\nJosh Glover: Terry, Josh. Look, the goal is to go as quickly as we can to sign a $200 billion bank for our consumer lending solution obviously if you have to go through pretty detailed and long evaluation process. That's a fantastic proof point. So if you look at the other announcements we've put out even in this call, multiple community regional financial institutions picking us for both commercial -- small business and consumer. That's a great proof point that we'll try to take to the market. And frankly, for a $200 billion bank to pull the trigger on a consumer lending deal in this environment. It shows a lot of conviction. It's a great validation point. So we're excited. So to answer your question directly, we're going to go as quickly as we can. because ultimately, the scrutiny that we've stood up to shows that we can scale up.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And I guess the follow-up question is, -- you all recently hosted a great Analyst Day in terms of a lot of content, a lot of helpful content. One of the things I think we picked up from you all was the idea that ending 2Q, the ending ACV balance is up 14% year-over-year, I know we have a little bit of a kind of a moving part here in terms of some of the IMB churn. But do you still feel like there's -- that's kind of the floor or is the floor a bit higher? Is there anything you can share about kind of the risk as we move into calendar 2024 in subscription revenue kind of what's the low watermark?\nGregory Orenstein: Yes. Terry, I think we're going to, again, hold back on -- on addressing next year. We did give you some commentary around bookings this quarter versus last quarter as well as some commentary around how we're looking at the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So I think at this point, we'll probably leave it there. Again, noting that, that was, as we said at the Investor Day, kind of a data point in a point in time. And I think that's something that we would really look to revisit more on an annual basis versus on a quarterly basis. But hopefully, those data points in terms of the second half of the year over first are helpful to -- and the commentary around the ample pipeline coverage that we have are helpful in terms of how we're thinking about Q4 and ultimately ending the year strong.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. But Greg, just one quick follow-up on that. 4Q, you signed business. Some of this can be shorter dated activation schedules though, correct? So some of the products, if you do have a strong finish, some of that could meaningfully show up in calendar '24. Is that accurate? At least in the second half/\nGregory Orenstein: That is accurate. Yes. And again, as we talked about at Investor Day, we're seeing with the mix of business with some of the pricing evolution that we've addressed, we're seeing a quicker turn from signing to revenue. It's upwards of 28%, 30% in the first half of the year and compare that to the prior year, I think it was around 16%. And so we expect that trend to continue and so again, we'll be getting, as we go forward, more in-quarter or in-year revenue from deals that we signed in quarter and in year than we have in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.\nAdib Choudhury: Adib Choudhury on for Bob. So first question, just in terms of the significant Japan, could you kind of talk about how critical system integrators were, if at all? Now and more broadly, are you seeing kind of peers using a similar SI strategy in some of your core international cloud banking market?\nJosh Glover: Absolutely. This is Josh. The system integrators are part of that play. They have local presidents to understand the culture. We're taking some of these institutions literally from paper straight into the cloud. So having the local team change management expertise and scalabilities of those SIs particularly as we expand internationally, really helps. And we're pleased not just about the initial proof point, but also about the way these banks are thinking about the single platform where you have banks that are starting with mortgage, some are starting with commercial, but they're all doing it from the lens that they want to get the whole institution up on nCino.\nAdib Choudhury: Got it. And I guess one for Greg. Thinking about the long-term operating margin targets you guys laid out during the Investor Day, 35%, and that compares to the 12 or so implied from the current fiscal full year guide. As we think about annual margin expansion cadence? Should that kind of be evenly attributed or more front and back-end loaded? And what's the visibility you kind of have around that expansion?\nGregory Orenstein: Yes. We'll hold off giving any guidance beyond this year. Again, as we look at the target, I set out a time frame of four to six years. And I think it all depends on the opportunities that we see ultimately the market. But again, we're going to err on the side of growth. And to the extent that, that margin target is a little bit lower because our growth is higher as we march towards that rule of 50, we'd be very happy with that. So again, I think we'll update you as we move along in terms of progress that we're making, but we continue to see opportunities for leverage across the organization. Again, you see in the progress that we've made on our margin lines as well as on our OpEx lines. And I said earlier, the team has done a great job, the organization has done a great job embracing the environment that we've been operating in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Bergere of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAdam Bergere: Can you give some color on the deals that pushed? Is there any sort of commonality between those deals or thinking more in depth on them. Is there any way in which you could quantify to mentalize how much that may have impacted Q3 results? And lastly, how are those deals tracking now that you're roughly a month into Q4?\nJosh Glover: Absolutely, those are not deals that dropped out of the pipeline. Ultimately, sometimes they may have wanted to get another board look at that. Sometimes they may want to see how the year continued on. They are in this interest rate environment, continued to keep a keen eye on their credit quality. They're also thinking about their P&L as they deal with this margin compression. So we do not see a lack of conviction on the need for transformation. We do see more measured investment as they think about new lines of investment for the institution.\nPierre Naude: Yes. I think it's more a case of timing versus need. Also, we've not lost any of those deals to competitors. This is more a matter of let's revisit in the budget cycle for banks and as soon as those are solidified, we'll move forward. And we see that in our pipeline movements as well. So we're very optimistic that we're going to see some of those coming through.\nAdam Bergere: Got it. And as a quick follow-up, have you sort of embedded that new assumption of, I don't know, these are taking a little longer than expected into the Q4 guide?\nPierre Naude: Yes. Our Q4 guide is assuming that it's -- we understand now very well the churn expectations in the market, both on IMBs. So we've taken a conservative view, and we built that into the guidance that we provided.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Sklar of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAlex Sklar: Great Greg, outside of the $2 million accrual that you called out that it sales and marketing this quarter. Was there anything else onetime impacting operating income this quarter? And then kind of unrelated to your answer about preferring growth, a couple of the earlier questions, Can you just talk about what's being factored from a hiring or an investment perspective in fourth quarter relative to third quarter driving kind of the sequential margin decline?\nGregory Orenstein: Yes. So from it was $2.8 million. That was really the onetime thing. The other thing I'd note is in the second quarter, we had our insight, our annual user conference. And so that's a heavier spend. So as you look at it on a sequential basis, I would note that as well. When you look at fourth quarter, it's the guide that we provided ultimately taking into account, obviously, holidays seasonality that we sometimes see in the fourth quarter. So I think that's what is impacting the guide if you deduct the onetime that I noted from the total and you look at the guide that we gave, I know there's a small little delta there, but that's really what it comes down to.\nAlex Sklar: Okay. Perfect. So no major incremental hiring kind of in the year-end above and bound kind of normal operating?\nGregory Orenstein: No. I think for us, it's business as usual. As we look into the fourth quarter, a big focus on obviously, closing business, as Josh noted, in echoing Pierre's comments, we have -- we see ample coverage from a sales pipeline perspective, and so we're just focused on execution between now and the end of the fiscal year.\nAlex Sklar: Okay. Great color. And Josh, just one for you. It seems like good NIC sales again I heard that 25% growth in adoption. I think you flagged though, recently that you're seeing higher NIC deal sizes as well. So any way you can kind of frame the revenue growth from NIC, is it meaningfully above that 25% figure?\nJosh Glover: Yes. And the stat that we quoted was we see 25% year-over-year growth in NIC adoption on the platform. That brings us to 34% of platform customers who've adopted NIC to date. Also in the quarter, we had for portfolio analytics, one of our great NIC solutions, the biggest deal we've ever done with the bank and the biggest deal we've ever done with the credit union. So we're pleased with that momentum. Greg, do you want to speak about how that flows through revenue?\nGregory Orenstein: Yes. I mean, ultimately, again, as we talk about with our NIC solutions that turns quicker into revenue. And so we see that more quickly impacting our P&L, that's exciting as we look at the mix of business and again, the evolution of our pricing model.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. I want to dig in quickly. And I think, Pierre, in the past, you've alluded to some inertia in the sales cycle. Is that kind of what you're seeing right now? And is that consistent? Or is that what you're also talking about when you say that you've got customers that are kind of waiting for the interest rate environment to stabilize before kind of moving ahead and making decisions?\nPierre Naude: Yes. Look, we've got banks where profitability is down as much as 40% year-over-year, as announced by public institutions. And so you can imagine when you have that kind of environment, but they're all looking for a stability of the future. And right now, they still there's massive debate, is the Fed going to raise rates once more, is it going to start cutting, et cetera. And these have impacts both on the psychology as well as the actual results of banking. And so what we are seeing is people are cautiously becoming optimistic, but waiting to see that this stabilized environment is setting in. I don't think they necessarily wait for the rates to start coming down. I think bankers in general, believe it will more stabilize the certain point. And the moment that stabilization is set in place. They are ready to make investments. And you're just seeing that level of uncertainty and the moment that's over according to our pipelines and our conversations with banks, they have to do this. This is where they have to go. This is the kind of platform they need for IT simplification, modernization. This is what the consumer wants. They needed for the deposit gathering. They need it for efficiency, they need it is for compliance. So, they all know that and we meet with them on a frequent basis. And I was just in Europe where one customer said to me, look, man, the project is a bit more difficult than we expected. But what else do you do which, of course, is music to my ears. So I feel very optimistic that we're in a good strategic place. Our platform is maturing at the right time. And is -- this phenomenal noncommercial wins are willing to show is that this whole architecture and effort we put in is going to pay off.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. Got it. And then, Greg, I know you kind of have touched on this in a couple of different ways, but I just want to try to make sure that we understand in terms of the change in churn, if churn has remained stable at your previous assumption? How much of an impact -- or how would you have been changing your fourth quarter guide at all? I'm just trying to make sure that we understand the level of churn impact versus other factors?\nGregory Orenstein: It was a big part. I mean, you saw we rolled some of our over performance in Q3 into Q4 in terms of upping our guidance but ultimately not the whole thing. And so that certainly was an impact. And the engines what we really saw was just October. I mean interest rates were specifically mortgage rates peaked and ultimately, just some of the IMBs,I think just said enough was enough. As we looked at the first month of this quarter, so far, things are more in line with what we expect. And obviously, this is something we've been tracking for the last year plus. The team has done a really good job of tracking the churn. I do think it was somewhat just a unique set of circumstances in October with that spike that really increased the churn level from really what our expectations were.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Altmann of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. It sounds like there's a lot of excitement around banking advisers. So I wanted to ask a couple of questions there. I guess just the first one being, what is the initial customer feedback then from those who are beta testing it, is there any sort of update on the monetization strategy there? And then just as a follow-up, is the best way to think about the opportunity with banking adviser really around the installed base with nCino IQ? And should that really kind of foster more cross-sell activity into NIC? Or should we kind of think about those as mutually exclusive?\nJosh Glover: This is Josh. We've been pleased but not surprised by the customer excitement about this. We've done, I think, a really good job of meeting our customers where they are. The problems they are really asking us to help them solve today is helping with efficiency and also helping with employee effectiveness and employee engagement. So if you think about the initial use cases where we'll have the ability for banking adviser to offer a knowledge base where a banker rather than navigating a 300-page PDF of a credit memo, they can have that at their fingertips where they can have intelligent credit memo narratives where rather than sitting and typing out the risk of doing a hotel loan in Florida, they can use generative AI to tell them that, look, we have seasonal risk because of tourism, we have hurricane risk, et cetera. So those are things that are going to make employees a lot more efficient and frankly, help banks, even though the labor market is becoming a little bit more employer-friendly, it will help them attract the kind of employees that they need to continue evolving their bank because the smartest kid graduating university today does not want to go sit and thumb through a 300-page credit memo or credit policy. So those are the kind of things that we've seen relative to monetization. Banking adviser is something that will contribute to nCino's growth. And I would expect to see NIC use cases continue to be monetized on a stand-alone basis, as you've heard from us with portfolio analytics with pricing and profitability. But we'll also use these tools to inject intelligence in every aspect of the application, which is a validation of the continued investment that we have and the ongoing growth that we get from our customers.\nNick Altmann: Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You guys mentioned earlier, 60% of gross ACV bookings came from the installed base in 3Q. When you look at the Q4 pipeline, how does that kind of look in terms of net new versus existing just given it's a seasonally strong spending quarter for software, there's budget flush dynamics, et cetera?\nJosh Glover: Yes. So we feel good about the pipe relative to our ability to deliver on the commitments that we've made for the fourth quarter. We're not also not being toned on the macro and realizing that the buying environment is tough. So we feel confident that we have ample coverage 60% in quarter from existing customers as we've seen when the market gets tough, our customers need us more, and we continue to focus on them. And that's one of the benefits of having such a fantastic customer base of happy customers that we partnered with for years. Composition has not changed relative to new deals or existing customers. As we said earlier, we're not seeing greenfield logos fall out of the pipe we're just seeing a more thoughtful time line for how they buy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Markgraff of KBCM. Your line is open.\nAlex Markgraff: I actually wanted to expand on the prior question, maybe ask it a bit differently. Just thinking about that mix of, say, gross ACV bookings on a more normalized basis or in a more normalized environment when you consider the pent-up demand, particularly in enterprise and some of the product expansions that are helping you lead with noncommercial products. Just curious, I mean, 60% for the last couple of quarters from existing, what is the good range to think about for that mix from, say, existing versus new on the other side of this kind of more challenging macro environment just considering the changes around product and such in the last couple of years?\nPierre Naude: Historically -- you saw -- we run about 50-50 which is good because you cross-sell into your base, you build these or products, you add more value. You upgrade them, and that gives you a bit of pricing power as well because of continuous innovation. And then 50% to new logos where you've got lower penetration, you can start cross-selling to them again. So historically, we ran at 50-50. What we saw through COVID was when the market was destabilized. It went to a much higher percentage cross-selling to existing base customers. And what you see in this destabilized liquidity environment, it edges up to that 60%. We believe that in the future, it will come back to more of a 50-50 ratio.\nAlex Markgraff: Great. And then I apologize if I missed this, but did you all provide the sales growth metric for the quarter as you did last quarter or not.\nGregory Orenstein: We did not. We provided the commentary around Q3 sales bookings being lower than Q2, but still confirming that we expect the second half of the year to be greater than the first half of the year from a gross bookings perspective. And just from an internal perspective, we did expect Q3 to be lower than Q2. So I'll note that just as we think about the year playing out..\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Trout of Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.\nRobert Trout: And nice to have my first earnings call as a covering analyst with the team here. If I could just ask two questions. The first on the evolution of the pricing model. Greg, I know you mentioned, I think, in response to Terry's question that the early indications from that migration, you're generally seeing a quicker path to revenue. And then -- but what I'm wondering is, while the employment -- the financial service financial services employment market is, as you mentioned, a bit more employer-friendly right now. Going forward, how does the job growth and [indiscernible] in the financial services market, the state of that, how does the new pricing model benefit or not benefit from -- from changes in that relative to the old pricing model?\nPierre Naude: Yes. So let me explain -- I'll use a simple use case, for instance, consumer banking. And if I take you back to an example of airlines, five years ago, we all used to call the airline, make a reservation, get the ticket, if you're lucky, through e-mail, printed out in your printer and go to the airport and you've got a paper boarding pass and a ticket with you, okay? Today, that sounds laughable, and you basically go into your phone, you book the ticket, your boarding passes are in your telephone in the app and boom you go. And you trust the system, okay? Banking literally is that 15, 20 years behind. There's still a lot of stuff that has to happen in brands, come show you driver's license, submit some documentation, proof of employment, et cetera. We believe in the next five years that we can move that consumer use case to a total digital end-to-end experience that's highly customer-friendly and fully automated. If you take that use case to that extent, it means that the employment shift in banking will move away from personal interactions between the consumer and the banker and much more to a middle back office exercise with people in self-service mode. As we are going to drive that value into banking, we're going to provide a pricing model that is more solution and platform based. And therefore, the bank will understand that they're going to have a massive one year on the cost side from us because these banks are all growing and they can redeploy their people, okay? There will still be some back office or call center activities going on to help consumers, who doesn't get it done on their own, just like an airline do. So our pricing models will reflect that value we bring to the table, number one; and number two, that it is a platform that is truly enabling the consumer to go end-to-end. If you go from there to small business, it will be more of a 40% fully automated, 60% banker involved. If you go to commercial, it will be more highly automated processes, but 100% banker involvement, okay? And that's how we're going to look at that across. But yes, solution-based and platform-based pricing will become the norm in our industry.\nRobert Trout: Okay. That's very helpful. And just on the consumer side. I just wanted to ask sort of a broader question about sales strategy. You had this wonderful win. Congratulations on that during the quarter. And I think you alluded to the amount of time and energy that gets spent landing, something like that. As consumer becomes and as international consumer also becomes a bigger portion of the pie, how do you think about perhaps changing your approach to your sales force, the way you train them the way you resource and the way you evaluate them. Both in terms of how they should -- who this prospect? What are the kind of the key metrics to evaluate them and how they're spending their time?\nJosh Glover: Our focus as we continue to take the single platform in these institutions as we are covering these accounts with a core account executive who maintains that relationship. This is a C-suite sale to multiple stakeholders in the C-suite and they expect us to have that core who drives the relationship. And we support them with a robust set of experts across our various solutions who can help them tell that story to those differentiated stakeholders within the institution. For example, you heard us speak about a $35 billion bank. They were already using us for commercial lending and consumer lending. This last quarter they purchase our mortgage solution. They're going to deliver a single platform that's going to put them ahead of their competition. That relationship was driven by a core account executive. But while driving in the consumer opportunity in the past, while driving in the mortgage opportunity this quarter, they had a specialist to help them. That's the best thing for our customers. For my CFO, he does get some operating leverage with time because in this market, where in the U.S., for example, banks are going through a period of consolidation. When I launch a new solution, I don't have to linearly grow my sales force, but I can thoughtfully support them with the specialists that they need to drive those other solutions in. So does that answer your question?\nRobert Trout: Yes, absolutely. Very helpful.\nPierre Naude: Yes, I can just add something to that, which is, remember, we sell to business owners. not necessarily to IT. IT is heavily involved. They assist us in integrations and project management, et cetera. But those business owners want to see business value. And what's put in seen or part since its inception, was the fact that we trained our salespeople to understand return on investment, understand how businesses will actually look at this investment they have to make and what value that will bring. If you look at that Japanese case we talked about earlier, that's a mortgage use case. which is very exciting because that's a consumer use case first in a place like Japan. So across the board, our people are trained and equipped to do an ROI model and actually win the business based on a solid business case and then with the help of IT get it installed.\nRobert Trout: That's a great point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Awesome. I'm sorry to lengthen the call here. But pricing has been mentioned a couple of times here on the call. And I think there was a question earlier just around pricing in the retail business. I guess I want to ask kind of a two-part question, right? So the first one is how much of the mortgage business is now being priced based on volume versus seats, right? And I guess the second question is just to loop in the great retail win, is there anything that you can disclose just on how the pricing structure works for that deal? Was there a decent volume component to it? Was it mostly seat-based? Anything you could talk about on pricing here for mortgage and for that retail deal.\nPierre Naude: Saket, as you know, that we never want to be a pure volume business. We said it from day one. That's why we like SimpleNexus. So we always include a platform component to that. Even when we had seed-based pricing, there is a component that is fixed. That's a minimum in the contract, and we like that -- we've always done that. In the soft mortgage market, we went in with lower platforms basis because that's how you penetrate the account, and they are skittish about making a massive commitment. But then on top of it, the pricing schedule is incentivizing them when volumes come back to update minimum commitment to get a lower unit cost on volume. So yes, we will see some volume upside when that market comes back. And then there's triggers built in, where if they then commit to us a higher, lower minimum, they will actually get a lower unit cost for that volume. And that is incentivizing good behavior for both parties because we get a bigger commitment, and they pay a lower unit cost price. So that's how we're going to edge it up to a much higher minimums again in the contracts when that market comes back. Does that make sense?\nSaket Kalia: Yes, that does. That's super helpful. And anything on that retail deal that you would call out as well?\nGregory Orenstein: Yes, Saket, I'll note that, that consumer lending deal did include a platform pricing fee. So that's how we structured that consistent with -- again, with where we're evolving the business and as a follow-up to the comments that I made on Investor Day starting in consumer and moving away from that seats, particularly with the digital element to it, as Josh highlighted, you got the in-branch and digital, and that's where, again, it's very much a value sale and what we're able to do for the institution versus an employee or a seat-based sale. And so that worked nicely in I think as we talked about previously, we think from a sales cycle standpoint, our customers and prospects are comfortable signing business with that structure. So we think that's helpful in the sales cycle as well.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Pierre Naude for any closing remarks.\nPierre Naude: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for attending our call today, and thank you for your insightful questions. We are excited about the business. We've got a great pipeline with good coverage. We are considering all factors in the current market as we give you guidance for the future. And hopefully, you can see our confidence in our strategy as well as our customer relations and our customer set we get from our clients. So thank you very much until next time. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by, and welcome to nCino Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Harrison Masters, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHarrison Masters: Good afternoon and welcome to nCino's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me on today's call are Pierre Naude, nCino's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Orenstein, Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Glover, President and Chief Revenue Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, strategies, and the anticipated performance of our business. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and expectations, entails certain assumptions made as of today's date and are subject to various risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and other publicly available documents, the financial services industry, and global economic conditions. nCino disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Further, on today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC just before this call, as well as the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investor.ncino.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.\nPierre Naude: Thank you, Harrison and thank you for joining us this afternoon to review our second quarter fiscal 2024 performance. We are very pleased with the results and the momentum we saw both throughout the quarter. Both total and subscription revenues increased 18%, while we again outperformed on profitability, posting a 10% non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter. We saw strength in sales activity across all parts of our business. We said last quarter that we expected a recovery in the second quarter and we certainly saw that with second quarter sales up 22% year-over-year. Our solid results mirror what we are hearing from customers. The U.S. banking industry has largely stabilized with the liquidity crisis behind us. Essentially, banks have caught their breath and most have refocused on their long-term strategy, which includes optimizing their technology infrastructure and providing a superior customer experience. The nCino platform was architected for just these purposes. It provides banks and credit unions of all sizes, a 360-degree view of the customer, allowing them to create a personalized, differentiated experience on a single platform. Leveraging this holistic view of the customer, nCino facilitates gathering deposits, originating any loan product, onboarding customers, and portfolio management all from one platform. In addition, our nIQ products such as commercial pricing and profitability, allow financial institutions to broaden their customer relationships, cross-sell, and optimize for profitability. This of course ultimately enhances their ability to successfully compete in an evolving market by balancing risk and reward. With high interest rates still in effect, financial institutions are seeing pressure on net interest margins. The most effective way to offset margin compression, while maintaining credit quality is by driving greater efficiency. nCino's platform was built to drive efficiency, while the automation at the core of the platform helps accelerate the industry's move to increased self-service. Building out the capabilities of the platform has always been a key growth driver. With many of our new products now reaching maturity, we are pleased by the increased number of products utilized per customer. In fact, over 40% of Bank Operating System, new logo deals in the second quarter included more than one solution. Another focus has been building out our footprint with current customers. This quarter, over 60% of sales were cross-sell and up-sell within the installed base. As we continue to expand the functionality of the platform, I can't overstate the value of our satisfied and the referenceable installed customer base. We are also seeing this expanding footprint reflected in our sales pipeline. As of the end of the second quarter, more than 50% of the pipeline is for products other than commercial lending. Let me reiterate that point, retail, small business, treasury, mortgage, and nIQ, all of the products we have created to supplement our traditional commercial lending business now represent over 50% of sales opportunities in the pipeline. I cannot tell you how excited we are to reach this level of demand for nCinos' technology beyond commercial lending. As a reminder, the SAM outside of commercial is twice as large. So we have a significant opportunity ahead. At nCino we diversified beyond products in customers. We are also diversified geographically. This has been particularly important with the uneven macro recovery. For example, in the second quarter we saw solid demand in EMEA, and APAC, including adding another large ESG customer in this case, a U.K.-based global bank, while many of the challenges bankers face outside the U.S. are universal, our ability to develop products specific to the needs of respective regions has been a key differentiator. Switching to the U.S., and in particular our continued progress with the nCino mortgage suite. The integration of the nCino and SimpleNexus' teams continues to accelerate our penetration of the banking channel. This quarter, we saw seven cross-sells, in addition to six competitive takeaways. We also closed the number of large pipeline deals we noted last quarter, including a seven-figure upsell deal with a top 10 mortgage lender. We ended the second quarter with another strong pipeline of mortgage deals, as mortgage lenders understand the need to become more efficient in order to compete in this market. I couldn't be prouder of the mortgage team for their continued revenue growth, again both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in this difficult and volatile mortgage market. I will let Josh provide additional details around U.S., mortgage. But first, I want to highlight our data capture and analytics capabilities are key differentiators for our mortgage offering. When surfaced through our compensate and Nexus vision products. One upsell deal with a top 100 mortgage originated this quarter involved adding these analytics offerings to round out the mortgage suite from existing SimpleNexus point of sale customer. Increasing ACV by over 50% for that account. But this is just one area where our data analytics expertise is core to our product roadmap. Let me spend a minute reviewing our ongoing nIQ strategy around intelligence including AI, machine learning, and analytics. With our single platform, we process vast amounts of data, including customer onboarding, loan origination, account opening, and bank customer financial information and we continue to invest to further automate every stage of production across the platform. As we've done with auto spreading, where we removed layers of manual work to accelerate the underwriting process for loans, we'll continue to develop solutions to help bankers make faster, more informed decisions. Our team has deep domain expertise in banking and is hard at work developing thoughtful solutions to the most complex issues our customers face. Recent internal demonstrations highlighted numerous use cases, including interactive virtual assistance and automated portfolio reviews. With our philosophy of an open ecosystem enabled by our API strategy, we are also attracting an impressive group of partners that are augmenting their nCino customer experience. Together, we are developing thoughtful solutions powered by AI, data, and analytics, to automate an increasing number of workflows within our single platform allowing financial institutions to eliminate reliance on legacy point solutions and become more and more efficient. We were pioneers, when bankers were reluctant to embrace the cloud. We prove that value proposition and today, cloud banking is considered the industry standard. Our original vision continues driving the evolution of financial services as we anticipated demand for AI and data when we launched our nIQ initiative over four years ago. It is exciting to see the industry embracing this technology as we continue on our journey to embed intelligence throughout our platform and change the financial services industry once more. To quote one of our customers, Ron Nix, CTO at VeraBank. What's important for technology vendors, is not to evaluate your needs today. But to predict where you are going to be in five years. We know in five years, nCino is going to be at the forefront of lending and we'll be right there with them. VeraBank, a community bank headquartered in Henderson Texas, partnered with nCino to modernize its lending processes and streamline employee and customer experiences. The bank has taken a full platform approach, adopting deposit account opening, portfolio analytics, retail lending, and commercial lending, including order spreading. We see them as a textbook example of how nCino could be adopted, across an organization to drive operational efficiency and we appreciate the trust in our vision for where the industry is headed. The makeup of our sales pipeline proves that nCinos' influence now extends far beyond commercial lending. With the continued expansion and maturity of our platform, we are poised to extend our market leadership to retail, small business, mortgage, data, analytics, and AI, matching our success in commercial loan origination. Our progress and positioning reinforce our optimism for the second half of fiscal 2024 and the years to come. Now let me turn the call to Josh to provide specific examples of our solid execution in the second quarter.\nJosh Glover: Thank you, Pierre. We're very pleased with our second quarter results. In the United States, we saw customers coming back to the table with a renewed focus on digital transformation projects. One such example is an expansion within the top four U.S. bank, who added additional users for small business lending. This deal is a great example of the white space we see in even our largest accounts to add additional lines of business and to expand user bases within our existing footprint. We closed the retail lending add-on in conjunction with the merger of equals between two community banks. The combined bank will standardize in nCino for retail and commercial lending, their deployment will also include auto spreading, deposit account opening and treasury onboarding. As we've experienced with many past M&A transactions within our customer base, nCino platform's ability to extend across multiple products and lines of business, while scaling with the bank as it grows, will combine the lending operations for the new bank. Integrating credit cultures and portfolio management are key to the success of the bank merger and we're proud to see another growth minded bank leveraging nCino to help with these mission critical merger activities. We believe and the market has validated that financial institutions using a single platform have the tools to grow more efficiently, while also delivering great differentiated customer experiences. For example, one of our regional bank customers like 291% increase in average monthly new deposit accounts opened online after implementing nCino. And expansion opportunity in over $10 billion bank that added retail and commercial lending, provided another proof point of our single platform strategy. These products join an existing small business lending deployment, bringing all the bank lending operations onto one platform with nCino. The State of Colorado was quite good to us this quarter. nCino was selected by yet another foreign credit institution for commercial lending and we did an expansion within a community bank for deposit account opening and treasury onboarding. This Colorado Community Bank already used nCino for commercial lending and for the mortgage homebuying journey. As Pierre noted, our U.S. mortgage business continues to benefit from nCino's well established brand and market presence within financial institutions. Our 19 new mortgage logos in the quarter were primarily with depository institutions, proving the value of our approach. We are particularly pleased by two net new logo deals where our mortgage suite was included in greenfield Bank Operating System deals. The first was a community bank retail lending deal that included portfolio analytics and mortgage. The second was a community bank committing to nCino for commercial lending, portfolio analytics, and mortgage. We're excited to see our customers look to nCino as the single trusted vendor across all their business lines, as they also incorporate our nIQ solutions to accelerate the value they receive from our products. We'll continue to see our product strategy focused on the value, nCino delivers across three pillars of intelligence, automation, and experience. These multi-solution greenfield deals illustrate the impact that strategy is providing for nCino's customers. Our global footprint continues to provide stability to our growth profile. This quarter we added another new logo in Australia, this time a top 10 Australian bank that will be deploying nCino's market leading commercial lending solution. nCino was selected to help the bank simplify their operating model, reduce cycle times, and improve the customer experience. I'm particularly, excited to note that this greenfield commercial loan origination deal also included nIQ's commercial pricing and profitability solution. This is yet another proof point of the opportunity for this solution in banks worldwide. Another recent area of focus for us has been addressing demand from the world's top 500 financial institutions beyond established nCino's geographic footprint, with great partnership from Accenture, our emerging markets team signed one of the largest banks in the UAE and our first customer in the Middle East for commercial lending. Our global partner ecosystem is a true force multiplier not only in delivering customer success, but also in our go-to-market efforts. System integrator ecosystems, unique combination of global reach, and local relationships, is helping nCino uncover sales opportunities in both new and emerging markets. Expansion within existing customers made a strong contribution to nCino's international success in the second quarter. An enterprise bank in the Netherlands expanded their adoption of our commercial lending solution and renewed their agreement with nCino for another five years. Also, beyond the borders of the Continental U.S., we had an over $10 billion asset Caribbean subsidiary of a global bank for commercial lending. We also signed a community bank in U.S. territory for retail lending, portfolio analytics, and for the mortgage homebuying journey, an exciting multi-solution deal. Sustained success in any market requires happy referenceable customers. We are pleased to take another early customer from the Japanese market live on nCino's commercial lending solution. We are appreciative of the opportunity early adopters have provided us in Japan and we look forward to highlighting more examples of success in that market. We also proudly celebrated Go Live milestones in other markets, for commercial, retail, small business, commercial pricing and profitability, and deposit account opening. As a customer-focused organization, we have continued appreciation for client feedback. We're extremely proud in the second quarter to receive the highest NPS score in company history, an average score of 74%. In addition to the talented customer success teams we feel around the globe, the maturity and stability of our single platforms are yielding demonstrable business value. And our recent investments in intelligent and usage analytics are allowing nCino's customers to benchmark and accelerate their own success. Greg, over to you for the financials.\nGreg Orenstein: Thank you, Josh and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon to review our second quarter fiscal '24 financial results. Please note that all numbers referenced in my remarks are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise stated. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC just before this call. Total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal '24 were $117.2 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Subscription revenues for the second quarter were $99.9 million, also an increase of 18% year-over-year and representing 85% of total revenues. Subscription revenues benefited from strong sales in the quarter with some of those deals contributing to revenues in the quarter. Professional services revenues were $17.3 million in the quarter, growing 14% year-over-year. Revenue growth outside the United States accelerated this quarter as a result of increased sales momentum that began in the second half of last year. Non- U.S. revenues were $21.9 million or 19% of total revenues in the second quarter up 47% year-over-year or 48% in constant currency. Non-GAAP gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $76.5 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65% compared to 65% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $11.2 million compared with $2.8 million loss in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was positive 10% compared with negative 3% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. We exceeded, non-GAAP operating income guidance with continued solid execution against expense budgets and from our revenue performance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $9.9 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $4.9 million or negative $0.04 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Our Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO increased to $928.6 million as of July 31st, 2023, up 2% over $907.4 million as of July 31st, 2022 with $636.2 million in the less than '24 months category, up 8% from $588.8 million as of July 31st, 2022. In addition to a strong sales quarter, RPO also benefited from a solid renewal quarter. As Josh noted, there were significant expansions, meaning an increase in annualized subscription revenues that accompanied several renewals. As we regularly highlight, we do not manage the business to RPO, but I do want to reinforce what Pierre mentioned earlier, it was a strong sales quarter with sales achievement up 22% year-over-year. Note that sales in the second quarter were greater in June and July. So some corresponding billings were occur in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $103.4 million including restricted cash. Net cash provided by operating activities was $12 million compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Capital expenditures were $859,000 in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow of $11.1 million for the second quarter. Please note that we expect to generate positive free cash flow through the balance of the fiscal year. Also note that we repaid the outstanding balance of $15 million on our $50 million revolving credit facility and have no amounts outstanding thereunder. Finally, please note that in July, through mediation, the company and the plaintiff and a putative class action complaint filed on March 12, 2021 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina reached a settlement agreement in principle of approximately $2.2 million that remains subject to court approval. The company has accrued for the proposed settlement agreement, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of July 31st, 2023 on the company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. We have excluded this expense from our non-GAAP results as it is outside the ordinary course of our business. Now turning to guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal '24, we expect total revenues of $120 million to $121 million with subscription revenues of $102.5 million to $103.5 million. This guidance assumes year-over-year subscription growth of 17% at the midpoint of our range. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be approximately $13 million to $15 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share to be $0.10 to $0.12 for the third quarter. This is based upon a weighted average of approximately $115 million diluted shares outstanding. Churn in the second quarter was in line with our expectations, but we are conscious that the IMB segment of our U.S. mortgage customer base continues to navigate the heightened interest rate environment. Accordingly, we intend to be prudent with full-year expectations by raising the low end of our revenue guidance for both total and subscription revenues, while maintaining the top end of our guidance for both. Despite this conservatism, our strong performance in the second quarter, the market stabilizing following the liquidity concerns earlier this year and the opportunities we see in our pipeline drive our optimism for the second half of the year. For fiscal '24, we expect total revenues of $475 million to $478.5 million with subscription revenues of $406 million to $409 million. This full-year guidance assumes year-over-year subscription growth of 18% at the midpoint of our range. We are increasing both the low and top end of our non-GAAP operating income guidance for fiscal '24 to $51 million to $54 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share is expected to be between $0.38 to $0.41 based upon a weighted average of approximately $115 million diluted shares outstanding. The top end of our subscription revenues and non-GAAP operating income guidance reflects our continued commitment to the Rule of 30 objective for the full fiscal year. With that, I'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nTerry Tillman: Hi there, good afternoon. Usually on these calls, when we have important new lighthouse accounts in different regions, but I tried to stay higher, some sort of greeting in local language. I've done it in German and French. Arabic, I don't know if it's Holon, but I tried my best. But great to see the UAE win. Maybe the first question for Pierre or Josh, is 22% sales growth, I'd like to unpack that a little bit more. Is that like an ACV bookings? And do you think that coming out of the thawing out that the business can keep picking up momentum versus 2Q sales activity, I'm talking about the second half of the year? And then I had a follow-up for -- as well. Thank you.\nPierre Naude: Terry, thanks for that question. Yes, just a reminder that 22% is year-over-year. Okay, and not quarter-over-quarter, which makes it more remarkable. I think it shows the pent-up demand and it also shows the momentum we see in the market. As I look at the global markets, including the U.S., I would say the only place where people are still careful is the U.S. enterprise market, where the regional and big banks are strategically aligned and moving forward, but very careful to buy. Apart from that, and the rest of the segments community region in the U.S., we see strong demand and internationally we see very strong interest. I believe the current economic environment for net interest margin squeezes, is truly a driver for review to efficiency. And as we mentioned, we've got the platform and that's being reconfirmed as visit customers and drive around it. Josh, anything to add?\nJosh Glover: No. Nothing to add to that.\nTerry Tillman: That's great to hear. And I guess maybe the follow-up question for Greg. Greg, I mean, I think what you said is that some of the activity in June and July really doesn't show up much in RPO. But then you did talk about the sales activity up year-over-year, people are going to be thinking about what you've done year-to-date and then what might happen in the second half of the year as we start to foretell how revenue looks next year? But I'm just kind of curious, as it relates to the metric because we do look at it the RPO or CRPO. Do you feel like based on what you see just those reported metrics are troughing in 2Q and they could start perking up in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nGreg Orenstein: Hi Terry. My comment around the activity and the heightened activity towards the end of the quarter was related to billings, where we got some deals signed that would have been reflected in RPO, but ultimately from a billing standpoint that would have happened post quarter end. But overall to Pierre's comments and what you heard in our prepared remarks, we definitely saw momentum pickup as the quarter progressed. And going back to my comments when I was kind of on the investor circuit last quarter, we said that we expected second quarter to be better than first quarter and obviously we demonstrated that. And we expected the second half of the year from a sales/bookings perspective to be better than the first half. The momentum we're seeing right now will enforces that belief.\nGreg Orenstein: That's great, good job in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Charles Nabhan from Stephens. Your line is now open.\nCharles Nabhan: Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. It's good to see the momentum in the mortgage business cross selling into the FI customer base. But I'm just curious given the recent uptick in rates, if you're seeing any stabilization in churn within the legacy IMB base for SimpleNexus?\nGreg Orenstein: Yes, again as I mentioned in my remarks, the churn was in line in the second quarter with our expectations. We're not seeing increased churn from a forecasting our guidance perspective, we did really roll some of our overperformance not through really to account for, I'd say unexpected churn in the second half of the year, there's nothing as we sit here today that has us or leads us to believe that we'll have heightened churn beyond our forecast, but ultimately just in this market going back to your comments around mortgage rates we wanted to take a conservative view. I think what's amazing about that business is despite the challenge of the mortgage market, the fact that they've continued to grow year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter since we acquired the business and I think that positions us incredibly well when the market ultimately does stabilize and then ultimately rebounds, particularly as we've aligned with a lot of the larger better capitalized IMBs. And as we've had additional sales into the nCino financial institution customer base. So I think while we're focused a little bit on churn now, I think as we think into the future as things settle down, I think that's going to be a significant opportunity for us from a growth standpoint.\nCharles Nabhan: Got it. And as a follow-up, just looking at the full year guide for '23, it looks like you're well on track to hit that Rule of 30 target exiting the year. But you've also talked about hitting the Rule of 40, at some point as well. So my question is, given the shift in the pipeline away from commercial and momentum in cross sell activity. I'm curious, how we should think about the long-term trajectory of the margin of progress towards that Rule of 40 and how we should think about that from both on margin and a revenue standpoint?\nPierre Naude: Yes. We look forward to share our future models at our Investor Day. And actually explain how we see the future, it's been three-years since we've been public. The business mix has changed. We made some acquisitions and all those impacted models. I can just tell you from purely looking at sales activity and performance, as well as the pipeline size as well as the pipeline mix, which to me is really interesting. I want to make sure that they sort of pullback in commercial. It's more of the adoption of newer products across the platform as well. So we are full speed ahead to maintain our market leadership in commercial, while we are rolling out additional new platform products, which is really showing up now in our sales as well as in our customer base. Just add for clarification.\nGreg Orenstein: And Chuck, just one other thing to add. Again we said Rule of 30, was kind of a stake in the ground this year, but the expectation should be that we'll increase that as the years progressed to get to 40 and beyond. And so from our perspective, this is really the first step in that journey, we again put that stake in the ground this year. And kudos to the whole team in terms of how we've been executing through what's been a difficult first half of the year from a customer standpoint.\nCharles Nabhan: Got it. Appreciate the color, guys, and look forward to hearing more at the Analyst Day. Thank you.\nPierre Naude: Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I guess for me, I'm looking at kind of this cross-sell and some of these activities. And you mentioned that you've had an increase in customers that are adopting more than one product. Historically, nIQ module adoption tends to result in around 20% uplift to ACV in an existing commercial customer. Given the potential for difference in seat count and pricing between commercial and retail. I'm curious to learn if your -- you front similar math on ACV uplift, if the existing commercial customer adopts retail, just trying to get a sense of potential leverage there on that cross-selling opportunity.\nGreg Orenstein: Yeah. We've not disclosed or really commented previously on that, again, I think as we gear up for our first Investor Day at the end of September, our intent is to provide different cuts of the business and provide additional details, so that you guys can have a better understanding of how this platform story is truly playing out and really the whitespace we have within our customer base and beyond.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And then quickly on kind of large deal impacts is one of your European competitors has spoken about improvements in large deals. How would you characterize the demand environment in those larger asset bases and opportunities, particularly given the lumpiness in the RPO metric for large deals and renewals was just wondering how that could be impacting and how you're thinking about that going forward?\nJosh Glover: This is Josh. We're pleased with the engagement that we're seeing, we called out a few exciting larger opportunities that we formalized this last quarter in those spend a variety of geographies. You had a nice win in Australia and one of their top 10 banks. We had a nice expansion in a global bank with our ESG solution out of the U.K. We had that win in the Middle East. So we're pleased with where we are. We also had an expansion within a large account in the Netherlands. So we saw that market impacted last year kind of early, they came back early, and those proof point show their continued engagement momentum that we're seeing there.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Thanks so much.\nPierre Naude: Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks guys. I wanted to ask a quick clarification question on the 22% sales achievement growth on a year-over-year basis. Is that quota attainment, is that net new ACV. Can you just maybe comment on what you mean by that 22% number?\nGreg Orenstein: So that's a 22% increase in bookings year-over-year as we look at the Q2 compare.\nNick Altmann: And is that on a ACV basis?\nGreg Orenstein: The overall gross booking. Yes, on an ACV basis.\nNick Altmann: Okay. And then I guess my second question is, I think you had mentioned 60% of the bookings in the quarter were cross sells. I guess when you look at the pipeline for the second half. How much of the pipeline is sort of net new versus existing? And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned 50% of the pipeline is for products outside of commercial lending. So can you maybe just talk about whether retail and SMB is acting more of a front door in terms of your pipeline are or these sort of more expansion oriented deals? Thanks.\nGreg Orenstein: I'll get the first question, Josh, if you want to take the second. From a pipe perspective, there's a healthy mix between new and leveraging current customers are selling back into the base. So we're excited about that that mix, which we think is important. But as Pierre noted in his comments, our customer base is an incredible asset and as our newer products continue to mature and we see them adopt more, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity we have there in addition to go into net new customers.\nJosh Glover: And that commercial customer base obviously being where we started. For a while that would be the entry point, we would try to add other solutions like retailer or deposit account opening. Those solutions have matured and so we're seeing situations where if a customer's priority is to start with retail or account opening or something else, they able to do so in, we get them live with confidence. Have you still see some accounts, we spoke about in prior quarters, we've talked about Johnson Financial Group for those accounts who make a large multi-solution commitment. Obviously, those are quite exciting. But it's our job to present the solutions, showed the broad single platform vision and then we're going to show a customer a path to success based on what makes sense for them to the time. We'll bet on nCino, we'll bet on our ecosystem, we'll get them live and then hopefully expand with the other solutions later.\nGreg Orenstein: And with the maturing of the products our ability to enter anywhere to Josh's point that the bank has an issue that they're trying to address. We think it's really exciting as we look forward.\nJosh Glover: On the other side of the liquidity reality from earlier in the year, though we do see these banks, coming back to the idea that the best most stable path for the future to grow and to grow in an efficient manner is to provide a broad set of products that fulfill a variety of customer needs, to fulfill them very well across multiple channels, and that brings you back to a single platform vision and we're seeing that continue to be adopted by the market. Really excited about that stat that Pierre referenced where we have 40% of new logos committed to more than one solution on day one, but we believe that's not just a validation of our product maturity, but really us being nicely aligned to what's on bankers' minds today.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Cris Kennedy from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nCrisKennedy: Thank you for taking the questions. Just going back to the pipeline comment. Over 50% of the pipeline is outside of commercial lending. Can you just rank order the importance, whether it's nIQ, treasury, retail et cetera?\nJoshGlover: So we're pleased with the volume of pipe that we see in the consumer side of these banks. That may be retail, it may be account opening or it may be our mortgage solution. When you see the stat, 19 new logos for SimpleNexus, I commented on it, but more than half of those were actually in depositories. So that's really resonating well. It's aligning nicely with the accounts that we've worked hard to sign and show a path to success over the years, the brand that we've built there. So it's a mix of those. I would say, at a high level, the most significant components of the pipe in the consumer side of our product portfolio, our retail lending and SimpleNexus and then also account opening.\nCrisKennedy: Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. You just mentioned that 40% of new logos are using more than one solution. How has that trended over time? What was that statistic maybe a year or two years ago? Thank you.\nJoshGlover: So we -- yes, to clarify, in the last quarter, we saw 40% of our new logos committing to more than one solution on one day. We've seen an increase on that across the full product portfolio as well. We're now looking at 27% of our platform customers using more than one solution. That's a year-over-year increase as well.\nGregOrenstein: And that excludes nIQ. You're talking pure platforms.\nJoshGlover: 27% of pure platform, 49% if you include one -- at least one nIQ solution.\nCrisKennedy: Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird. Your line is now open.\nJoeVruwink: Okay. Great. Thanks. Hi, everyone. Pierre, you mentioned in a previous answer, just wanting to be appropriately resourced so that you maintain leadership in core commercial, but then certainly exploit and pursue the other areas. Can you maybe just go into a bit more detail on what that all means just relative to the previous long-term operating model and some of the expense ratios and margin targets you've outlined? And does it suggest that maybe expense ratios could counterbalance higher over the midterm time frame, just relative to what's obviously been a great expense leverage this year?\nPierre Naude: Yes. No, what I would say is I wanted to make sure that people understand, we are still investing in that commercial product, and we still see a massive global opportunity. To remind you, we've returned 400 accounts in the U.S. There's over 2,000 that we're targeting right now, but there's over 4,300 banks. There's over 5,000 credit unions. We've got the mortgage product now that goes after IMBs as well, it's over 4,000 institutions. So you're talking about over 10,000 institutions that we can target, okay? Obviously, commercial does not go after IMBs. But with this deal in the Middle East, we're opening a new front where we are going outside of our core countries, along with our SIs to sell these on what I would call named account deals. So we've got a list of accounts globally we're targeting. And those are very exciting deals And it shows you how we can take that thing and take it across borders and it doesn't need much changing to actually run in these countries. And that's why I want to make sure people understand we will continue to invest not only in the product itself, but into nIQ elements around the credit underwriting and the driving of efficiency in the commercial base. That is the profit center of many, many of these banks. The second profit center if we go outside the U.S. is the mortgage balance sheet. They keep all those mortgages on balance sheet because it's a variable rate product with a great piece of collateral attached, which is your house, which you don't want to lose and so you keep on paying. So I think we are well positioned to actually address the core issues that banking has in the foreseeable future, drive efficiency and a heavy load of self-service. And so from that perspective, I wanted to make sure there's a balanced view of commercial growth, maintaining market leadership because we work hard to get there. And then as these other products mature, they're all coming up to pull their weight down.\nGregOrenstein: Yes. And Joe, just to add, all of this is part of our plan. Again, we've made a lot of investments over the last couple of years, both in expanding geographically as well as expanding our product portfolio whether it's retail or again, everyone is talking about AI. We've been investing in AI now for four years in machine learning and analytics. And so this is all part of continued execution versus any net new investments if I heard your question.\nJoeVruwink: Yes. No, that's good. Thank you. And then on the careful approach being taken by the U.S. enterprise segment. When that spending comes back, do you think it comes back in the product areas where decisions have maybe been put on a bit of a pause? Or just given some of the strategic things you've been speaking of today, thinking about focus on net interest margin, ESG, credit quality portfolio, visibility, what's on the books? Do you think engagement and the scope of what a bank might consider nCino for changes for better or worse when that spending comes back?\nJoshGlover: We think we're just going to see them with a more dedicated focus to providing that robust set of products so they can use to fulfill a variety of customer needs. So they're always going to want to do their commercial and business purpose lending well because, obviously, that's really important to their business, and it's where a lot of other assets sit. But we see increased engagement in the other offerings as well. And then within all of our solutions, they're going to want to look to leverage intelligence at the point of execution as well as they can to take that optimized process and make it even better.\nPierre Naude: I've been traveling around the country to meet with customers. And there is clearly a rethinking of the old strategy. For the longest time in banking, I've always had, we love consumer deposits -- and I'm talking about the U.S. now, we love consumer deposits, but we like commercial lending. Now if you look at deposit trends across the banking sector, a lot of these deposits and consumer accounts moved to the big four, which has been for years a problem, but it wasn't as magnified as we've seen lately. And one customer commented to me that there was always a big benefit for them to have these low interest rate, big customer deposits that were seen as an asset. And when Silicon Valley Bank happened, all of a sudden, the atmosphere around that change and people said, you should have consumer deposits. And what that is doing now is that people are rethinking their relationship with the customer, okay? And they realize that if you want a good relationship with a consumer customer, you need to provide the technology, the self-service and the ease of use that you can expect from companies with big brands like JPMorgan, National Bank of America, where they have a brand around their technology. And then nCino can fill that void because we're so client-centric. We provide the account opening, we provide the low origination, et cetera, from consumer up to the small business and all the way up to commercial. And I think that is what's going to drive that IT simplification and that renewed strategy and focus on the customer as opposed to the siloed way of going to market inside these banks. And I've heard that echoed as I traveled around the country.\nJoeVruwink: That's great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Alex Sklar from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJessica Wang: This is Jessica on for Alex. Thanks for taking my questions. Start off with, I was just wondering, when you're considering your R&D investments and product road map? What are your ongoing R&D priorities? For example, are you thinking about like for developing, enhancing nIQ versus your other existing or possibly new products? Thanks.\nPierre Naude: Yes. So if you look historically at the company, we went public in 2020. It's just three years ago. And these are probably materials. We spent $34 million on product. And this year, we spent around $100 million. So it's not that we need to incrementally spend a lot more now. We've literally bulked up the situation so that we are ready because remember, we've been doing nIQ for four years, okay? So this is not some new revelation to us that, oh, we all of a sudden have to move to intelligence. We've been working for years on the daily basis. The analytics on acquiring companies to get us there faster, okay? So what we're doing now is we always evaluate all the product suites. We look at customer needs, broadening of the markets because when you launch these products, it may be a subset of customers who can use them. And then over time, as you add feature functions or integrations or different elements, you can broaden that customer appeal. And so what we're doing now is we evaluate the opportunity ahead of us, and we will shift money around. But there's clearly an emphasis on driving nIQ because nIQ and all those products underneath that intelligence umbrella, will actually differentiate us through the point where it will be difficult to compete with us in the market. If you combine the intelligence with the platform and client-centric approach, we feel pretty good about our competitive position.\nJessica Wang: Got it. Thanks for that. And I've got a follow-up question. When you're looking at different lines of growth opportunity, like it's been really great hearing about the big wins you've had nationally, what are you thinking as -- like where are you most confident in your business today? Is it more international, again, you said it was nIQ the differentiation you have or there is something else? Thanks.\nJoshGlover: Yes. As you think about the various markets that we serve in the United States is continuing to grow our single platform presence. We've thrown out a few sets earlier that show increased adoption of customers there. In some of our international markets, we're just focused on continuing to add logos and build that great customer base that we continue expanding and intelligence as part of the conversation in every market that we serve.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nJ.R. Herrera: Thanks for taking the question. This is J.R. asking on behalf of Brent. Touching on CRPO once again, how should we think about the 2024 growth rate with current RPO growth of 10% in Q1 and 8% in Q2, is low double-digit growth doable? Or could we be looking at high single-digit growth? Thank you.\nPierre Naude: Let me first make a comment about RPO. Remember, depending on the seasonality of bookings, renewals could play a significant distorting impact on RPO. In other words, we could have low bookings but a big renewal quarter and all of a sudden, RPO jumps 20%. So I will be very careful to make too much of a deal about RPO. It is, to me, an indicator, but I think you should carefully listen to the additional comments and data we provide you to actually come to a conclusion with that. Greg, do you have anything else to add?\nGregOrenstein: I think, again, we do try to consistently remind folks that we don't manage the business to RPO. And again, there's a lot of moving parts in it and really point to the guidance that we provide with the visibility that we have in the model, both on the top and bottom line, and that's what we point you to J.R.\nJ.R. Herrera: Sounds great. Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jackson Ader from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nJackson Ader: Great. Hi, guys. The first question is for you, Pierre. The rate environment outside of the U.S., I mean, I guess, specifically in Europe, it's a little behind where we are in the state, but still, I think, maybe some room to go higher. And so I'm just curious if the U.S. enterprise segment at the moment is kind of being the most cautious as you look around, what are your expectations maybe for how European banks will react once we get maybe to kind of the peak rate cycle in that geography?\nPierre Naude: Yes. I would always remind people that all problems are relative. And if you look at the starting of the shock of the war last year as well as the energy crisis. The rate complexity today looks like Sunday school picnic compared to what they dealt with last year, okay? And then you add the Swiss Bank who also had liquidity problems and then got taken over. So what I would tell you is that it's relatively good. It's not ideal and everybody in banking would like to see declining rates coming forward again. But normally, there's a cycle that you have to get through where your loan rates, in other words, your income can raise as well because your current portfolio sits there stable and your deposit rates go up, so that's a squeeze on adding those margins. But over time, as you renew those loans and you jack the rates up. As long as the economy stays healthy, you don't see a lot of problems in the credit book. I think these banks will come through this fine. It's -- I'm always amazed about good bankers are to manage the credit side. I think the surprise was the liquidity angle was a big surprise and it came out of left field as well as the ease of withdrawing money today in an Internet-enabled world versus the previous time they saw this, you literally have to stand in line to get your money and they could close the door, okay? So -- but what we're hearing is there is a renewed focus on strategy and how they would like to move forward. I will also tell you that, as I mentioned before, in Europe, there's a lot more regulation and government involvement in these banks. And that's why ESG is a great play for us there. As a matter of fact, I'm going over there to talk to some of the banks in September about this, understanding the industry better, where that's going to take us. But I'm still seeing significant interest in new technologies and how they can manage themselves better.\nJackson Ader: Okay. All right. Great. That is helpful context. One quick follow-up for Greg. The linearity that you spoke about in the quarter, the June and July impacting billings maybe moving into the next quarter. Was there -- was the quarter like more back-end loaded from a bookings perspective than you typically see in the second quarter or than you typically see in any given quarter?\nGregOrenstein: No. I think, again, just coming on the other side of the liquidity crisis, we just saw the momentum build as the quarter progressed and things settle down, Jackson. I think that really more than anything would have been -- would be the thing to note for Q2.\nJackson Ader: I'm sorry, I just mean like was it more or less back-end loaded than usual or like than you expected?\nGregOrenstein: No. I think it was in line with expectations. And again, speaking in the middle of the quarter and again talking to investors, we tried to highlight some of the momentum that we saw building and the quarter came together nicely. Our team did a great job, and it was nice to see.\nJackson Ader: All right. Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Adam Bergere from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAdam Bergere: Thank you. And, good afternoon. So how is the balance between the focus for new logos versus expansion deals changed this year so far? And how are you thinking about that balance on a go-forward basis with liquidity crisis that you're doing there? Thank you.\nJoshGlover: The balance of our field focus hasn't changed. We make sure we have a team on the field out in the market to tell the story to new logos, and we also make sure we're able to take care of our existing accounts. The reality is when things get challenging. The first thing that slows down is the greenfield conversations because it's just hard for folks to continue on with due diligence with the new vendor, which is a good situation for us to be in because we have a great and happy referenceable customer base. So that will explain at some points when you see macroeconomic ups and downs, why we may see a little bit heavier weighting of expansion bookings. So part of that is just the reality of where the world is. But our market focus has not changed at all.\nAdam Bergere: Got it. And then between kind of your go-to-market motion for domestic versus international, is it fairly consistent between the two as well in terms of new logos versus expansion?\nJoshGlover: Consistent focus and consistent motions, just different maturity of markets and time and market, which leads to a different distribution of market penetration in the customer base.\nAdam Bergere: Yes. Makes sense. Thanks.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hi, guys, thanks for getting me in here. I'll keep it quick with kind of two housekeeping questions. Maybe the first one is for you, Josh. As you think about that 22% sales achievement, which certainly was great to see, and it sounded better. How do you sort of rank order the product areas that you felt like drove that growth? I mean, was it still very much driven by commercial lending? Or do you feel like the pipeline composition, things like retail, things like nIQ and others also drove a lot of that sales achievement as well. That's the first question.\nJoshGlover: Saket, it's nice to speak to you. No, we had a good mix of offerings here. We talked about 19 new logos on the SimpleNexus side. One of the stats that we referenced is 40% of our new logos have multiple solutions. So you will see commercial or small business involved in those, but you also see things like retail, SimpleNexus and nIQ offerings involved. So from our perspective, look, we're very proud of that commercial product, and we take good care of it. We take care of our customers, but we continue to see expansion and new logos with those other solutions as well.\nSaket Kalia: That's great. It's great to see that breadth. Maybe the follow-up for you, Greg, is maybe a little bit of a longer-term question, but that 50% pipeline point on what I'll call commercial lending versus noncommercial lending. The question for you is, what does that mix look like in revenue terms today? And where do you think that mix can go over the next few years?\nGregOrenstein: Yes. So from a market perspective, Saket, I think Pierre noted the market outside of commercial is twice as big. And so we attack commercial first, but again, we see a massive opportunity on the retail side with retail lending with our U.S. mortgage business with mortgage outside of the U.S. And so again, I think as we think about the opportunity we have, we think we're just getting started. And ultimately, just based on our SAM studies, that opportunity is twice as large as commercial.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nKen Suchoski: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll ask another one on the pipeline and that 50% that's coming from the noncommercial lending products. I mean when we talk to folks, I think what really stands out is your reputation on the commercial lending side. And Pierre, I think you've mentioned maintaining your market leadership in commercial lending. So can you talk about the competitive dynamic in remote, I guess, in the noncommercial lending products and your confidence in holding your own versus the competition just because it is a big part of the SAM?\nPierre Naude: Yes. Thank you. That's a great question. Look, our platform centricity as well as the customer focus, I think is a big differentiator for us. Consumer is a much more simplistic product set because your end user experience must be a lot more simplistic and ease of use and instantaneous. However, because of all the regulations, it's a fairly difficult product to develop with all the integrations to actually make it that simplistic to use. So it's a complex problem you're solving, but you have to make it simple to the end consumer. If you then look back at other people selling into that consumer or small business base. What you're basically seeing is a bunch of companies who developed software in the '80s and '90s. And so we're coming out of the box here with a modern cloud-based solution that is part of a broader IT infrastructure and I don't see other people coming up trying to do the same thing here. So I do think this is back to that reputation thing. If we maintain the reputation in the biggest profit center of the bank, we get the influence to go in there and get at least the opportunity. And then if you execute well and maintain the reputation, I think you're going to see exactly this playbook about the same momentum and the same market leadership in the other aspects of the platform. And that's what we're focused on here. And then the meetings I have outside of commercial around the country, I'm hearing similar stories. So I'm highly optimistic this strategy will play out.\nKen Suchoski: Okay. Great. And maybe just as my follow-up, maybe I'll ask about M&A. There was some commentary out there a couple of months ago stating the company might be exploring strategic options, including a potential sale. So I was wondering how, I guess, you guys are thinking about the potential options for the company here because we are getting a lot of questions on it. And I guess, is this is a company that should be in the public markets? I know you've talked about not disclosing certain metrics due to competitive reasons. So I would love to just get your latest thinking there.\nGregOrenstein: Ken, I appreciate the question, but I'm sure you can appreciate, we don't comment on rumor and speculation. So can't really address that any further.\nPierre Naude: We love what we do.\nGregOrenstein: We do love what we do.\nKen Suchoski: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our last question comes from Alex Markgraff from KBCM. Your line is now open.\nAlexMarkgraff: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just first on the Middle East win. When you think about some of these opportunities in less penetrated international markets, just curious maybe, Josh, for you, do you feel like all the pieces are in place here to kind of go full steam ahead with these types of opportunities?\nJoshGlover: First of all, it's a reputation-based company. We're not going to make a commitment to a bank that we're not ready to follow through on. So when we go into a new market, we're excited to announce one of the largest banks in the UAE. We're going to show them a great path to success. So the pieces are absolutely there. I have a high level of confidence in the distribution machine and the teams on the ground in those markets that show those customers a path to success. And as we validated in Europe, in APAC, in Japan, in Canada, the global system and a greater ecosystem gives us unprecedented scalability to where if you remember several years ago, we signed three Toronto banks in one year, and we showed them a path to success by leveraging the same ecosystem. So we're excited and we're proud and we'll be just getting started in those markets.\nAlexMarkgraff: Thanks for that. And maybe just one quick follow-up on the second half. Just curious if there's any way for you all to kind of describe the renewal opportunity in the second half for us?\nGregOrenstein: From a customer -- current customer basis in terms of what the renewal forecast looks like Alex?\nAlexMarkgraff: Yes, yes.\nJoshGlover: So we see a normal year there in seasonality. We don't really guide to that. And from our perspective, we're going to keep taking care of those customers renewing as we have an opportunity and hopefully formalize those partnerships for a long time.\nGregOrenstein: Yes. I think contracts have terms, but again, as additional products become of interest to customers that can accelerate a renewal as well. And so we always see a new sales opportunity as an opportunity to expand. So hard to predict that outside of kind of our normal cadence out.\nAlexMarkgraff: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Pierre Naude for closing remarks.\nPierre Naude: Thank you all for joining us today. I want to thank the nCino employees around the world for their passion, focus and execution, particularly over the past six months, and senior teammates have helped customers through a very difficult period, proving yet again that our culture and business values are true differentiators in the market. We are excited to welcome any of you to our first Investor Day on September 28 in Wilmington, North Carolina. We'll share updates on our product strategy and additional insight into our financial outlook among other topics. We look forward to seeing you then. Thank you so much for attending tonight.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Harrison Masters, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance.\nHarrison Masters: Good afternoon, and welcome to nCino's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me on today's call are Pierre Naude, nCino's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Orenstein, Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Glover, President and Chief Revenue Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, strategies and the anticipated performance of our business. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and expectations, entails certain assumptions made as of today's date, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties described in our SEC filings and other publicly available documents, the financial services industry and global economic conditions. nCino disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Further, on today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release, which is available on our website, and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC just before this call, as well as the earnings presentation, on our Investor Relations website at investor.ncino.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.\nPierre Naude: Thank you, Harrison. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to share the details and accomplishments of our first quarter, including our continued focus on profitable growth, resulting in a 10% non-GAAP operating margin, as well as $29.7 million of free cash flow. Total revenues grew 21% in the quarter, exceeding the top end of our guidance. We also experienced record attendance at our sold-out user conference, nSight, a few weeks ago, with attendees representing 15 countries, 320 financial institutions and 29 sponsoring partners. This year, we moved the conference to Charlotte, North Carolina, to accommodate the over 1,700 attendees from around the globe who came to network with their peers, share best practices, discuss the future of banking and see the latest nCino innovations. Even as we focus on achieving our commitments around profitability and cash flow, we still expect to invest over $100 million in R&D this fiscal year. Innovation is at the heart of nCino's DNA. And at nSight, we highlighted our continued product investment and recent and upcoming innovations centered on 3 key themes: Automation, Experience and Intelligence. Automation is where nCino started 11 years ago, when we began to automate the complex commercial lending process for community and regional banks in the US. With automation, financial institutions benefit from faster product delivery to their customers, increased efficiency in operations and improved accuracy in their systems. Automation continues to be a fundamental part of nCino's product strategy across all product lines, asset classes and regions. In this era of driving efficiency and productivity, we continue to automate processes that allow our customers to get more and more out of their platform investment. Within Experience, we were excited to demonstrate a new consumer front end which integrates the SimpleNexus mobile-first UI to the front end of the nCino bank operating system, further enhancing the consumer lending experience. The third key theme was Intelligence. As a reminder, we launched nIQ, our suite of products utilizing data analytics, machine learning and AI 4 years ago. Our close relationships with our customers helped us recognize early on the critical role data plays in running successful financial institutions. We've been encouraged by the continued growth of our existing nIQ products, automated spreading, commercial pricing and profitability and portfolio analytics. The ability to provide data and insights and drive intelligence to every user at every stage of production across the financial institution is another benefit of our single platform. Today, nCino's unique customer base represents over 50% of C&I lending assets in the U.S., over 86% of all U.S. farm credit association assets, around 38% of all Canadian bank assets and 25% of all U.S. mortgage loans originated last year. Our product road map is unique in that it can leverage the large data set afforded by our broad and diverse customer base to deliver an ever-increasing level of intelligence such as automated reviews and renewals, early warnings, automated credit decisions and pricing for even more loan products as we expand upon our nIQ offerings. Turning back to our first quarter results. As we shared during our last call, Q1 was expected to be a slow sales quarter. However, our pipeline remains healthy, and we are seeing larger deals move through the pipeline. I want to share some feedback with you that we've received from our sales teams in the field and directly from attendees at nSight, representing our different market segments and geographic regions. While all segments recognize the importance of modernization, buying propensity in Q1 differed between these segments. For example, community banks, which we define as those with assets below $10 billion, appear to have been relatively unaffected by liquidity concerns. Regional banks, with assets between $10 billion and $100 billion, have seen slightly more impact, although those without exposure to unsecured deposit concentrations have continued to perform well. It's within the U.S. Enterprise segment, those above $100 billion assets, where we have seen the most impact which caused lengthening sales cycles, particularly with larger sales opportunities. However, the commentary we are hearing from our customers and prospects, paired with significant opportunities in the pipeline, reinforces our belief that this is a short-term situation. Institutions of all sizes are committed to modernization and investing in automation and intelligence. For example, we saw solid growth in EMEA in the first quarter in both bookings and qualified pipeline. We also saw strong traction in APAC. Our geographic diversification is an asset, and is helping to offset the current weakness in the U.S. enterprise market. Another segment of financial services we address is mortgage. While the US mortgage market remains under pressure, we continue to grow market share with two more competitive takeouts in the first quarter. Additionally, the integration of the SimpleNexus team into core nCino is benefiting all aspects of the organization, including driving some of the largest pipeline opportunities in SimpleNexus history, particularly with larger banks and credit unions. The integration of the SimpleNexus and nCino product teams is helping accelerate our future product development effort as well, including the consumer front end I mentioned earlier and other enhancements and integrations across the platform. I couldn't be more proud of their progress. Over my career, I've experienced many volatile market periods and economic cycles. As CEO, my goal is always to focus on execution and controlling what we can control, regardless of short-term headwinds. We went into Q1 knowing that sales, specifically with enterprise customers, would be weak given the market conditions. Yet the opportunities in the pipeline record attendance at nSight and conversations with our customers around the globe reinforces that we are on the right path with the right strategy. From a financial standpoint, we remain firmly committed to executing this strategy with continued profitable growth and achieving the rule of 30 for fiscal '24. Now let me turn the call over to Josh for additional details on our progress in the quarter.\nJosh Glover: Thanks, Pierre. nSight is an opportunity for us to showcase recent customer success, and nothing makes us prouder than to have satisfied clients joining us onstage to talk about their nCino journey. Representatives from financial institutions across market segments and geographies spoke about how they have partnered with nCino to reengineer processes to deliver a streamlined production and faster decision with less swivel chair between systems. For example, Lisa Frazier, Chief Operating Officer of top Australian small and medium enterprise vendor, Judo Bank, shared how nCino has been a critical part of their journey and growth trajectory. Judo Bank first started with nCino for lending, and from December 2020 to December 2022, they grew their loan book from $2.6 billion to $7.5 billion. Since going live on nCino for retail deposits in November of 2022, Judo Bank has already experienced a 5% increase in application completion rate, a 9-point increase in the bank's Net Promoter Score and an 80% decrease in customer support calls. We demonstrated new product enhancements and features including improved borrower experiences for consumer lending, new integrations and automation for small business lending, strategic partnerships for intelligent consumer credit decisions and automated underwriting, and live demonstrations of SimpleNexus mobile technology being used to expand and augment usage of the nCino bank operating system. Our product portfolio addresses the challenges financial institutions face today such as commercial real estate softening, credit monitoring and interest rate fluctuations by enabling them with intelligence and automation throughout the life cycle of a loan. During nSight, we showed how nCino leverages intelligence to help customers identify the likelihood of default, offer data visualization for tenancy and vacancy within commercial real estate portfolios, provide automated credit decisions, price commercial loans based on the entire customer relationship and automate the review of commercial loans. We also view an evolving regulatory environment as an opportunity to assist our customers with data capture and recording around ESG, fair lending requirements and DoD 1071. The data strategy Pierre mentioned allows us to continue innovating, adding efficiencies and delivering more value to our customers throughout our single platform. The nIQ product road map includes predictive analytics, even more automation, easier compliance and improved monitoring. Turning to the quarter, let's discuss some of the go-live milestones we achieved for customers. We completed a small business Go Live for a top 4 U.S. bank, we helped a top 50 U.S. bank replace their internally developed commercial pricing tool with nCino's commercial pricing and profitability solution, we completed a successful TRID-compliant retail lending implementations with several platform customers, and we achieved a commercial and consumer platform rollout for a $4 billion bank within just 7 months. On the sales front, we penetrated from our diversified market presence as some of the non-U.S. markets were our strongest growth regions. Our team in EMEA had another strong quarter, building on the success they had in the fourth quarter, adding one of the U.K.'s top mortgage lenders as a customer for property lending. This new customer sale was an important validation point for the UK property lending market where we are well positioned to help the largest lenders. The EMEA team also renewed, extended and grew our relationship with the Top 4 U.K. bank and closed an upsell opportunity with a Top 4 French bank to support ESG initiatives. To round out achievements across our target geographies, the team signed an agreement with an existing South African customer for automated spreading. nIQ solutions continued to gain traction in the U.S. as well, where we signed an over $7 billion asset California-based lender for commercial lending, portfolio analytics and automated spreading. In Q1, we also closed expansion deals with two Top 25 U.S. banks for customer portal and additional treasury, onboarding users respectively. Customers have shared that treasury services provide not only important fee revenue but also create stickier deposit relationships as corporate operating accounts are less likely to flow on rate alone. In fact, we believe our single platform vision resonates even better in the current environment as it allows our customers to provide a robust product set that they can fulfill effectively across multiple channels. In the U.S. mortgage industry, we continue to acquire new logos, cross-sell additional products and win customers from our competition as we yet again grow revenues in our mortgage business despite the difficult environment. We're also nearing completion on integration work to connect with more third-party mortgage LOS providers. These integrations will enable us to even more aggressively sell SimpleNexus in the largest financial institutions in the U.S. Our conviction and the opportunity to continue modernizing the financial service industry has never been stronger, and the demand we see is reflected in the strength of our customer success stories and our pipeline. Greg, can you please take us through the financial results?\nGreg Orenstein: Thank you, Josh, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to review our first quarter fiscal 2024 financial results. Please note that all numbers referenced in my remarks are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise stated. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC just before this call. We are pleased with our first quarter results. Total revenues were $113.7 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Subscription revenues for the first quarter were $97.3 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year, representing 86% of total revenues. Subscription revenues were in line with the top end of our guidance despite the turbulence in the U.S. enterprise bank and mortgage markets. Professional services revenues were $16.3 million in the quarter, growing 9% year-over-year. We did see project delays and postponements from three enterprise banks in the US distracted by liquidity concerns that negatively impacted professional servicefs revenues by approximately $150,000 in the quarter with a commensurate impact on services margin. We expect these specific project delays and postponements will negatively impact Professional Services revenues by approximately $1.25 million for the full year. We redeployed the nCino personnel assigned to the impacted projects into the community market segment, which appears to have been largely unaffected by deposit flows, and continue seeing success with our managed services practice, both of which we expect will help mitigate the impact to Professional Services gross margin for the year. Non-U.S. revenues were $19.2 million or 17% of total revenues in the first quarter, up 35% year-over-year or 43% in constant currency. The APAC region contributed strong sequential growth and more than doubled year-over-year, with the increase primarily attributable to subscription revenues. We continue to expect revenues from outside the U.S. to remain accretive to growth, primarily on the Subscription revenues line. Non-GAAP gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $73.8 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65% compared to 64% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Our gross margin improvement in the quarter was largely due to a year-over-year improvement in customer support margins and from subscription revenues being a larger contributor to total revenues. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $10.9 million compared with a loss of $3.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was positive 10% compared with negative 4% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. We continue to focus on profitable growth and operating efficiencies, leading to a balanced outperformance against expense budgets and a record quarter on the bottom line. Additionally, although we are no longer breaking out SimpleNexus, we have received questions about their impact on our bottom line and wanted to note that we expect Simple Nexus, which you will increasingly hear us refer to as our U.S. mortgage business, to generate non-GAAP operating income and contribute positive free cash flow for fiscal '24. Despite the ongoing challenges in the mortgage market, particularly with independent mortgage banks, the SimpleNexus business continues to perform well and take market share. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $8 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to a loss of $6.1 million or negative $0.06 per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $914 million as of April 30, 2023, up 1% from $905.6 million as of April 30, 2022, with $622.6 million in the less than 24 months category, up 10% from $567.3 million as of April 30, 2022. FX contributed an approximately 0.5% headwind to total RPO year-over-year. As I noted on last quarter's call, we expected delays in closing deals in the first quarter in light of the liquidity issues in the US. bank market, and as such, the sequential decline in RPO was expected based on our internal models. Though, as a reminder, we do not drive the business to RPO or current RPO targets. Contract durations for RPO additions in the quarter were healthy and existing customers, including renewals, accounted for just over 80% of the gross additions to RPO in the quarter. Churn in the quarter of annualized subscription revenues was $8.6 million related to prior year M&A activity, independent mortgage banks downsizing or going out of business and the expiration of some PPP agreements, as I referenced on last quarter's earnings call. This amount of churn was in line with overall expectations, but from a timing standpoint, some of the independent mortgage bank churn occurred sooner than anticipated, which will negatively impact our second quarter and full year subscription revenues. We expect our churn rate to remain elevated in the second quarter but still be in line with our 6% assumption for the full year. We continue to believe that churn rates will return to more historical norms of 2% to 3% in future years. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $103.5 million, including restricted cash, and following the payment of $15 million on our credit line, which now has $15 million outstanding. Net cash provided by operating activities was $31.3 million compared to $1.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures were $1.6 million in the quarter, resulting in a record quarter of $29.7 million in free cash flow for the first quarter of fiscal '24. Moving on to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect total revenues of $114 million to $115.5 million, with subscription revenues of $97.5 million to $98.5 million. The subscription revenues guidance includes an approximately 2% revenue headwind from the impact of the churn noted above. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be approximately $8 million to $9.5 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share to be $0.06 to $0.08 for the second quarter. This is based upon a weighted average of approximately 114.5 million diluted shares outstanding. As you heard from Josh and Pierre, we hosted our user conference in May, so sales and marketing expenses will be seasonally higher in the second quarter, which will negatively impact our bottom line performance. For fiscal year '24, we expect total revenues to be $474 million to $478.5 million, with subscription revenues of $405 million to $409 million. The full year total revenue guidance takes the $1.25 million of project delays and postponements and the churn I previously mentioned into account, and assumes the majority of churn in fiscal '24 occurs in the first half of the year, primarily from independent mortgage banks. Given this assumption, we expect revenue growth rates to stabilize in the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP operating income for fiscal '24 to be $48 million to $52.5 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share is expected to be $0.37 to $0.40 based upon a weighted average of approximately 115 million diluted shares outstanding. We expect to see operating leverage continue to improve in the second half of the year. We remain confident in the opportunities in front of us and focused on continuing to execute on our profitable growth strategy, which includes achieving our Rule of 30 target for fiscal year '24. With that, I'll open the line-up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Nabhan from Stephens.\nCharles Nabhan: I wanted to get a little more detail around the [indiscernible] delayed implementations and specifically around your expectations for those deals, whether you see them transpiring at some point during the year or next year? And maybe some comments around the root causes of those delays would be helpful as well.\nPierre Naude: Yes. Let me first -- thanks for your question. Let me first give you this assurance. Those delays in projects did not impact activation schedules of seats in any way, shape or form as per our contracts, and as we have explained for your modeling before. Maybe, Josh or Greg can give more details on the project itself?\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. And so again, from time to time, projects are delayed. That's not completely uncommon, as Pierre noted. Projects, in general, are not connected to activation dates so that's not part of the equation here. And we work with our customers through those. These three enterprise banks, you could appreciate were impacted by the liquidity issues that took place in Q1. And ultimately, as they add things to prioritize and focus on the delayed or postponed projects that we were working on, we'll continue to work with those customers and hopefully reengage with them as the year progresses. And again, they're able to turn their attention back to what we were working on with them.\nCharles Nabhan: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, I was hoping to get your comments around the mortgage business. I think some of the churn within -- among independent mortgage brokers has been widely publicized. But I was hoping you could comment on the health of your remaining customer base, specifically in terms of whether they've sort of rightsized their head count at this point, and more align their cost structure with environment?\nPierre Naude: It appears to us from commentary and interaction with our clients that that customer base is stabilized, and the companies who wanted to close down or decided to cut back on resources have done so. That's what it appears like at this stage. We are feeling very optimistic versus if you can realize our business has been growing year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter in that business. And what we're doing now is focus heavily on banking as well, which is a more stable mortgage base. And as you can imagine, with the current turmoil in the mortgage market and the competitors, we're seeing a fantastic opportunity, and we're pursuing those deals as aggressive as we can.\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. Charles, ultimately, I think we end up with a smaller number of larger, more well-capitalized IMBs, and I think that will be a good base to grow from as the dust settles. And again, in parallel, focus on expanding in the banking credit union market which we've had success just in the year that we've had SimpleNexus as part of the nCino family.\nOperator: fOperator Instructions] And our next question comes from Nick Altmann from Scotiabank.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Pierre, you talked about how some of these larger deals in the pipeline remain intact, but you also kind of called out the Enterprise segment as being a little bit more challenged and maybe seeing a little bit incremental weakness in the quarter. So I guess my first question is just, what are sort of these larger enterprise-level financial institutions telling you from a buying propensity perspective? Are they telling you sort of wait for the second half? Is it initiatives are just shelved in the interim? Just sort of any incremental color you can kind of provide for us around what the customers are exactly telling you about getting some of these larger initiatives across the line.\nPierre Naude: Yes. Thanks. I realize that liquidity issues and the pace at which it happens, if you look at Silicon Valley Bank that in 10 hours, the deposits were drained, that was a shock to the system that is unknown to most management teams currently in their seats. So you clearly got this shock effect, and then people started looking at their own balance sheets and wanted to make sure that they've got the right allocations and the right liquidity as needed. That shock effect, I would say, is largely over now. Banks feel confident that they can proceed with the right liquidity levels they need right now, so we see people moving away from paying attention to that back to more strategic elements. The early indications are that in second quarter, we begin to see deals coming loose and is moving down the pipelines again. The people are meeting with us. They're willing to see us on site. And as you know, just from inside, they're willing to travel and come see us. So we feel that the worst is behind us and we will see a slight improvement in second quarter and then a pickup in third and fourth quarter. But that's the commentary we get. We also see that already in Europe. We believe Europe is ahead of the U.S. on more of a positive approach, buying approach, so I feel optimistic for the rest of the year.\nNick Altmann: Great. And then just as a follow-up and going off that comment, understand the bookings and revenue ramp dynamics that you guys have in the model. But can you maybe and maybe not provide a growth framework for next year, but just understanding there's sort of this lag of when you book a deal to when the revenue is sort of ramped, and you guys recognize it? If some of these larger deals sort of come in into 3Q and 4Q, will that not necessarily be recognized in the revenue next year? And if that's the case, what are you guys sort of doing in the interim? or what are sort of the remedies to sort of protect revenue growth next year as you think about some of these larger deals that have multiyear ramps are a little bit more challenged? Is it upselling back into the installed base? Is it nIQ? Just sort of any incremental color you can give around how you're thinking about revenue growth for next year given the bookings dynamics for this year?\nPierre Naude: Yes. I'm going to let Greg comment on the specific mechanics and how the rev rec works and then how we see next year. We're not going to comment specifics on next year, but I just want to remind people on the call about the models and how they work for this year. When you have a slow Q1, some of that revenue should fall into this year, in Q2. What happens after July has minimal effect of this year. There are some products that's a quick turn on. But that's why what you're seeing us is making sure that we've got this year, the credibility and the visibility to you exactly what we see is happening right now. As we look at the deals in the pipe, that's going to come later in Q2 and then Q3 and Q4. That's what's actually going to impact next year, and the pipe looks healthy. We feel optimistic. We're having great conversations on a global basis. And Greg, why don't you go into a little bit more into how that schedule works and what you could see?\nGregOrenstein: Yes. No, I think you hit it, Pierre, in terms of -- as it relates to things being a little bit more back-end loaded this year, Nick. It really is an impact to fiscal '24 versus fiscal '25. And so as we talk about the pipe that we see, the opportunities that we see and how that plays out in the rest of the year, again, we think that without getting into fiscal '25, we think that's helpful for fiscal '25. And in the meantime, I think Pierre also noted, we do have a portion of our revenue base which is much quicker from an activation standpoint. So when you think about our SimpleNexus offering and when you think about our nIQ offerings, those turn-ons are much quicker than the historic bank operating system activation schedule.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Q - Terry Tillman Maybe the first question for Pierre or Josh is just on the international side. It seems like that's kind of definitely a glass half full situation right now. There's relative strength. What's the confidence level of that activity continuing from 2Q through the rest of the year? And is it new logos? Or is it just the expanding portfolio of products and just activations with existing customers? Just trying to understand how much we can hang our hat on international holding in there the rest of the year and then I have a follow-up.\nJosh Glover: Yes. Good to speak with you, Terry, and thanks for the question. We are really proud of how our Europe team did in the first quarter. We spoke about that. That was a bright spot for us. Signing that property lender, obviously, is an indication of the retail story there as well as the team's ability to execute. If you were at nSight, Terry, you would have seen a total of 15 countries represented in this environment for folks to make that trip as a good validation. So we're absolutely seeing momentum with greenfield accounts as referenced there. You saw a South African account adopt auto spreading this quarter. So we're continuing to tell the story on both the new accounts, and existing accounts are seeing the benefit. Things like our ESG module where we had an account in France adopt us for ESG. So we're proud of that. We'll keep telling the story. That team has done a nice job. They had a tough start last year, if you remember our commentary, but we're seeing green shoots there and pleased with their progress.\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. And just one more thing to add, Josh, is that the property lending opportunity was a net new customer for nCino. We're excited for that offering. Q - Terry Tillman That's good to know. Yes. We wish you all have one of these conferences every quarter, although I guess it would add to sales and marketing. We talked to over 20 customers. It was a great event. nIQ, in particular stood out, so no. It was a great exposure for us. So thanks for the invitation there. The one follow-up question for you, Greg, just relates to just optically, the second half of the year, there's even more operating leverage. So that's important, and we get that, and that's great. But with the RPO and the 24-month RPO, is that something that could erode a little bit more into 2Q and then it starts also to get better in the second half? Just kind of help us with how we should think about that into 2Q.\nGreg Orenstein: Terrell to make sure I follow. You're talking about RPO? Or are you're talking about expense leverage? I just lost you for a second. Q - Terry Tillman Yes, I had a preamble. The preamble was like operating leverage gets even stronger in the second half of the year, and that's great. What about the RPO and then the 24-month RPO in the near term? I mean it's kind of sluggish in the first quarter. Are there optics or just comparables that will start to improve with that in 2Q? Or could that still be kind of challenged in the near term in relationship to what is clear cut second half strength in operating leverage?\nGreg Orenstein: Yes, got you. Got you. Yes. Q1 RPO is seasonally slow. We've actually had RPO down I think 3x sequentially since being public, so it's not unusual for us. And again, we tried to preview this when we were on our last call. And as I said in my prepared remarks, this is really in line with our kind of internal guides, and so we do expect that to improve as the year progresses. And again, as we look at the pipes, as we look at the conversations that we're having with our customers and as we look at the activity, I think we, again, expect that to improve. But nothing is out of line with what we said to you back in the end of March.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucettev: Great. I wanted to follow up on a couple of quick things. I guess the first is like when we look at some of the bank closures, it seems like there might be a potential in as much as 3% headwind on revenue there. But the timing and the way that they're being just taken care of is a little bit uncertain. So how should we be thinking about when you should have a good idea of what that ultimate revenue you had mentioned should be?\nPierre Naude: We cannot comment on specific customer contracts or what we see there. We've got a history of success in laddering up in M&A deals. We know the companies who acquired these, our teams are working them all. And all of that risk is built into our forecast and our guidance. So I feel pretty good about what we see from there. Josh, anything you want to add?\nJosh Glover: Now all those situations are different. Our focus is to continue supporting those accounts as best we can. We feel that's the right thing to do. It's also what positions us best for the future. That's where our focus is now.\nJames Faucettev: Got it. Got it. Okay. That's helpful, especially the commentary around how you incorporated that. And then I wanted to just touch on quickly cash flow, saw a real shift there. I want to make sure I understand what's happening especially on the accounts receivable line? And how should we think about that and the cash flow dynamics generally? Is there something atypical that maybe happened near term? I just want to make sure we're calibrating ourselves correctly on a go-forward basis.\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. From a cash flow perspective, Q1 and Q2 are seasonally our highest cash flow quarters, It's been that way. But again, I think as you've seen us shift more towards profitability, we would expect that as we commented last quarter from a year perspective, we'd expect you to see that throughout the year. And so we're proud of the non-GAAP operating income and the cash flow that we generated. And I think from an operational perspective, there's additional opportunity to build that as the year progresses and we go into next year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Robert Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert Napoli: I was hoping to get maybe some update on nIQ, which products are really resonating there? And kind of -- if you can give some color on the growth rate of nIQ? And just what you feel the long-term opportunity is for nIQ from a TAM or revenue perspective?\nJosh Glover: Absolutely. We're proud of what we're doing there. We sit today with about 30% of bank operating system accounts leveraging nIQ. We spoke earlier in our Q&A about a South African account that adopted us for auto spreading. We're really proud to have a Top 50 bank in the U.S. live on pricing and profitability, and doing extremely well. Those are discerning accounts. Once you get to that size, it's a great validation point for us. But if you pull back to what we provide these customers, by getting the full value chain of front, middle, back office on one platform, taking the inefficiencies out of the process, streamlining from end to end, how they take care of their customers, that gives us a great landing space to come back and inject intelligence. So it's evidenced by what we've discussed with auto spreading, that's evidenced by the customers that we've discussed that are on pricing and profitability. There are a myriad of other opportunities to go back and further optimize that process. So we're pleased with that. If you're at nSight, you would have heard us really focus on the theme of intelligence, and that's timely and it's much need at the industry, and we'll continue going hard there.\nRobert Napoli: Any additional metrics on growth rate or size of the business, and the long-term potential for the size of that, of nIQ?\nPierre Naude: Yes. Currently, the TAM we've got out there is about a 20% lift on the current base, and we've made that public as we start building that out. Obviously, over time, we believe there's opportunity to expand pricing on that as those products mature, number one. And number two, a lot of opportunity to add products. Remember, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the amount of data that we have around the industry that banks are willing to share with us is tremendous, and they are working with us on use cases as well where we can build more nIQ products. So I'm very optimistic about that.\nRobert Napoli: Then a follow-up on just the investment in -- you've done -- I appreciate the operating profitability. It's great to see that. Obviously, the challenge is as you have flat investment in sales and marketing year-over-year, how do you keep the growth engine rolling? So how have you been able to -- obviously, it seems like you had some nice wins in the quarter. But how do you adjust to take from the very high growth in sales and marketing to having that flatten out, but still looking to have the growth momentum for next year and the next several years?\nJosh Glover: Yes. And that compare -- when you look at it, it does include some periods where we made structural investments in new markets, and it takes a while given the complexity of what we do in the sales cycle that we navigate to mature those bets and continue to optimize that. So we're pleased with where we sit. As of now, we see a total of 16 cross-sales of SimpleNexus that we've done into the nCino customer base. When I look at the growth of pipeline of large financial institutions with SimpleNexus, it shows that that market coverage is helping. Look, we continue to throttle it. But as we've delivered on our commitment for our profitable growth framework, we are not sacrificing market coverage because we believe in the long term, and we'll continue to put the people on the field that we need to tell the story.\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. And to that point, if you look year-over-year, sales and marketing, again, relatively flat. We talked about some of the actions that we took where that was the least impacted part of the organization versus, for example, G&A. And so we want to make sure we have the right investments in place. We have the SAM covered and that we are making sure from a growth standpoint, we are executing as well as we can.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kenneth Suchoski from Autonomous Research.\nKenneth Suchoski: If I do the math right, it looks like you're forecasting a subscription revenue growth of, I think it's around 16% or so in fiscal 2Q and in the second half of the year. So I guess, is this the new normal for the next handful of quarters just given where the RPO growth is at the moment? And I guess, is the expectation to get back to that kind of 20% plus type of growth next year?\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. Ken, thanks for the question. We'll, from a quarter standpoint, we'll focus on the Q2. But ultimately, the churn specifically that we noted in the headwind really impacts Q2. That was really the comment that we tried to make in terms of revenue stabilizing from a growth standpoint in the second half of the year. And so we would really view Q2 as the low point, and again, driven significantly by the churn that happened, which the good news is that we're getting it behind us as the year progresses in the first half of the year. So I think that's how we respond to that question as you think about the full year.\nKenneth Suchoski: Okay. All right. Great. And then you mentioned the Rule of 30, and it looks like the non-GAAP operating income guide and the margin guide is up slightly versus the old guide and so you're implying, kind of better margins versus prior. So where is the outperformance coming from on the margin side? And then maybe you could just give us an update on your appetite to reinvest versus kind of letting the margins drift higher just because we are seeing a little bit of a slowdown in this macro environment?\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. Again, you'll see leverage across all of our operating expense lines. I think as we've consistently stated, we are going to continue on the side of growth, and so that remains our focus. And so again, we've been operating the business. We see continued leverage, as I noted in my remarks, in the second half of the year from an expense standpoint, but we're going to continue to focus on growth. And so yes, we are willing to reinvest as we see opportunities to grow in this market.\nPierre Naude: Yes. I just want to add something to that. To me, it was extraordinary about the culture of the company and how people, the employees are pulling together on this path of profitable growth. In our engineering teams, we have moved from two releases annually to much more of a cadence of monthly releases that's available to customers. They have to take it every six months. And if you look at how they embrace that, the productivity improvements and the pace of development that we see now versus the past tells you that when you shift your focus on pure growth to profitable growth and people begin to recognize the impact of value to customers in the short term and how that could help the company, that was extraordinary. So everywhere we look in the company, we have examples like that, that has driven efficiency, which was not your main focus on your pure growth. So we feel very good about our prospects for continued leverage on the cost line.\nKenneth Suchoski: Without impacting growth.\nPierre Naude: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have Adam [ph] from Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: A quick clarifying one. So the $1.25 million lower cost services revenue for this year, can we kind of concretely take that to mean that these three deals implementations have been delayed into the next fiscal year?\nGreg Orenstein: For purposes of guidance, that's what we are assuming. So we'll work with those customers on that in their time lines as they are able to focus back on projects versus other priority items, but that's what we're assuming from a guidance perspective.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then on the commentary for the U.S. mortgage business, I guess, SimpleNexus sounds great. And I wanted to get your thoughts on what specifically about that product do you think is kind of helping to drive the market share gains even in such a tough environment?\nJosh Glover: Look, SimpleNexus has built a fantastic product that has been really well received by the customer base. I was excited at nSight to see a customer who is one of our early adopters of the integration of the front end of SimpleNexus to make an operating system. They got live in 60 days. They've been extremely successful, and we are proud of that. The first reason that we believe they are continuing to gain market share in this environment is they have the most intuitive and well-adopted mortgage solution in the market. We think that team and the culture and the way they focus on their customers also shines through. And nCino's corporate stability and overall continued good execution is another strong point for folks who are paying attention to that with their software vendors.\nPierre Naude: Yes. Then if you look at us expanding the front end to include other retail and small business products, that was very, very well received at our conference, and we saw a lot of interest in people standardizing their customer experience onto a single platform. That also opens up our core platform with APIs, because we use exactly the same APIs for that front-end integration from SimpleNexus to the back end, and that's going to be exposed to our larger customers to access core nCino through those APIs. So that whole development has been very positive, and that's also driving demand for SimpleNexus because they can see they can do mortgage today. And then by the end of the year, they can start migrating some retail functions over as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jackson Ader from SVB MoffetNathanson.\nJackson Ader: Great. So the first one is, do you expect that this -- the lengthening of kind of deal cycles will lead to a catch-up maybe later in 2024? Or are you thinking, okay, this is just shifting things out?\nPierre Naude: No, there clearly is a point where it may accelerate bookings and concentrate that in a quarter or two as people start catching their breath and catching up. So what we are seeing right now is people are trying to get over a temporary slowdown, make sure that their house is in order and then we begin to see an acceleration of deals. That's what we see in movement in the pipe and the commentary from salespeople as well as the banks, and so we are pursuing those deals as aggressive as we can.\nJackson Ader: Okay. All right. Great. And then are there just -- on the SimpleNexus side in the independent mortgage brokers, are there others that you see -- like if we get -- I'm not saying it happens, but let's just say we have a pause in rate hikes and then a couple more come, and so we actually see maybe more independent brokers scale back or go out of business if rates go up. Is any of that factored into that third quarter, fourth quarter stabilization in the mortgage market?\nPierre Naude: We've considered the possibility of a further rate hike and what impact that may have -- sorry. Our forecast today look at the full marketplace, international as well as local mortgage as well as our core nCino in the U.S., we considered all of those. Obviously, I cannot foresee an incident like what we have with liquidity issues in banks. If that happens, that's outside of what I can forecast because that's truly a crisis. . From all the commentary both by our customers as well as general market commentary, what I'm seeing is that the financial markets have stabilized, and we feel good. We also feel that the -- in the mortgage business, the people who wanted to leave the business have gone, and that market is now concentrating on a few bigger players. And we feel good about our positioning there. And then if you look at the vendors in our space, we feel very good about our financial stability, the quality of our product and the speed that we can implement in, so we actually see this whole situation as an opportunity.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mayank Tandon from Needham & Company.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. This is actually [indiscernible] on for Mayank today. Just one quick one for me. You guys spoke a little bit about some of the success you had cross-selling, but could you guys dive a little deeper into how cross-selling was this past quarter? And then maybe specifically talk about that in terms of SimpleNexus?\nJosh Glover: So absolutely. As we discussed, we talked about an add-on of that mix solution in South Africa, that CPP or pricing and profitability opportunity that we spoke about, the Top 50 account that was also an add-on that went live. So the composition is going to be split between those nIQ solutions for mature customers. Then we're also continuing to go where we can and take things like SimpleNexus or retail lending into those accounts. So pleased with the progress. I think part of why we've been able to see deal size for SimpleNexus increase has been the stability of the bank mortgage market. We're proud to say that SimpleNexus' average deal size is up 35% year-over-year. That's a combination of good execution and market leadership and also, we believe opening up a new market, the bank and credit union side.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Alex Sklar from Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Alex. I just have one quick question. Pierre, at nSight, you talked about how banks would try and leverage deeper, whole customer relationships with customers, including treasury as a means of preventing deposit flights. How are [indiscernible] coming out of the conference?\nPierre Naude: Yes. Thank you. We exceedingly see banks understanding the value of the single platform and having a 360 view of the customer and actually drive a total business value to them as opposed to be product focused, okay, or silo focused. And I can tell you, as our products are maturing and -- we've got now over 80 retail lending customers using our product, okay? As that retail side is coming up, and our treasury logos is up 28% year-over-year. This whole notion that you can have a platform that is client focused with multiple products and you can actually center your attention to that customer and customer profitability with our tools and nIQ, et cetera, is really resonating because otherwise, your deposit flow goes to the 4 big banks, and they have to find a way to embrace the consumer, the retail customer, get those deposits in the banks because those are your $1,300 to $2,000 deposit accounts, and they don't flee for rates. And so that message was very well received, and it was interesting how many bankers came to me and commented on the fact that they didn't make this deposit loan connection from the consumer and appreciated those insights. And so we are feeling good about our strategic direction and the products we're building, and I think the banking sector is getting it.\nJosh Glover: I think what we've really seen, to add to that and then further to the cross-sell question from the prior question, is just a revisiting of the basics that to maintain those organic deposits, make them sticky, these banks want to fulfill a broad set of really nice products. They want to fulfill them very well across multiple channels. So when you look at expansion deals we had this quarter with top 25 banks, even in this environment, one of them adding our treasury solution, one of them adding portal. It aligns to that thesis.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Josh Beck from KeyBanc.\nJosh Beck: Yes. I wanted to ask you a little bit about some of the larger enterprise banks. I think you cited there were three of them with delays. Just when you kind of double-click on really some of the color that they gave, just if there were any consistencies and certainly also how they're thinking about the reengagement of certainly implementation? Just anything that's set out there would be great.\nJosh Glover: We see the market very focused on the expense line. And even if they are not totally taking out a project, they may want to look more closely at the resources they have on the project and try to run with the lighter team. So I think all those institutions have been watching the macro and are trying to be as efficient where they can spend and thoughtful with new investments. So, that's the high-level theme. I've not had banks say we don't think it's important to modernize. I've not had banks say that they don't need to digitize. But they have the CFOs too who look at expense lines, and they try to be thoughtful about this macro reality.\nGreg Orenstein: Yes. And Josh, I think specifically with those, I would note, again, from a timing standpoint, I think prioritization and addressing the liquidity matters that were going on played a large part in them focusing elsewhere for the near term.\nJosh Beck: Makes sense. And then, yes, I'm also curious, just -- I think one of the messages from certainly probably a lot of those similar banks that really the enterprise category is this attitude towards tightening as we go into the second half of the year, it's the calendar year. So I'm just kind of curious, like historically, are there any correlations that you've observed on the tightening within banks? And then a little bit related, just in terms of some of your deposit products, is that something really -- maybe this creates opportunity as banks become a little bit more focused on garnering deposits? Just curious if there's anything there to highlight as well.\nPierre Naude: Yes. Look, if you look at the cycles, the last time your liquidity crisis like this or raising rates was in the early '80s. But unfortunately, none of these bank managers was actually in senior enough positions to understand what was going on at the time. So as you look overall, what I would say is when we started the company in 2012, we hit the market at the right time because people realized you cannot stop modernizing because you fall behind. Some of the big companies have there's billions of dollars in IT budgets and they keep on investing, okay? And so your mid- to lower end markets struggle to catch up with technology investments. So I don't think this is going to be a long-term slowdown of spend. As a matter of fact, there's a number of studies out that says banks says no, we're going to keep on spending. You happen to stumble across the two, three, four that clearly had to address liquidity issues and they just had to focus on saving the bank. That is very different than something that's systemic across the industry. So what my view is that spending will continue, it will actually accelerate towards the second half of the year, and banks will continue to do this. Realize this. In these rate environments, the net interest margin squeeze is very tight on them. That lowers their income. The only lever left is actually operational efficiency. So you could look at their efficiency ratios, and if you look at the commentary that we get back from our surveys from our banks, nCino drives them to a much higher efficiency ratio, also a higher close rate on loans, and that's what they need. So overall, I think we will just come back in the second half of the year and continue on as always. It just takes a while to get there.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Pierre Naude, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.\nPierre Naude: Well, thank you all for joining us. Thanks to our shareholders for their support and our employees for the innovation, and I look forward to speak to you more at a later date. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
