[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Oona McCullough, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Ms. McCullough, you may begin.\nOona McCullough: Good afternoon, and welcome to the URBN Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Earlier this afternoon, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the 3- and 12-month period ending January 31, 2024. The following discussions may include forward-looking statements. Please note that actual results may differ materially from those statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On today's call, you'll hear from Richard Hayne, Chief Executive Officer, URBN; Frank Conforti, Co-President and COO URBN; and Melanie Marein-Efron, Chief Financial Officer, URBN. Following that, we will be pleased to address your questions. For more detailed commentary on our quarterly performance and the text of today's conference call, please refer to our Investor Relations website at www.urbn.com. I will now turn the call over to Dick.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin our prepared remarks, it's my pleasure to welcome Shea Jensen to today's call. As you know, Shea is our new President of Urban Outfitters North America. She comes with deep experience in the apparel and accessory categories, having spent many years at Nordstrom, and more recently as President of Good American. Shea has been in her new role here at URBN for 3 weeks, so she will not be answering any questions today, but will be happy to respond to your questions on future calls. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank to begin our discussion. Frank?\nFrank Conforti: Thank you, Dick, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will begin the call discussing our total company fourth quarter results versus the prior year, followed by some more detailed notes by brand. Please note, today, I will be speaking to our financial results on an adjusted basis, which does not include nonrecurring adjustments for asset impairments, lease abandonments and a change in the revenue recognition method at Nuuly. Each of these items is detailed in our press release as well as the investor presentation that is posted to our URBN Investor Relations website. Now on to our results. The fourth quarter performed largely in line with our thoughts as discussed on the third quarter call. Total company sales grew by 8% to a fourth quarter record of $1.5 billion, driven by a total Retail segment comp increase of 5%, and Nuuly segment revenue increase of 69%, and Wholesale segment revenue increase of 3%. The Retail segment comp was driven by a high single digit positive digital comp and a low single digit store comp. Comps in both channels were primarily the result of higher traffic and transactions. January, and in particular, the second and third weeks of the month, were the weakest of the quarter as we saw a negative impact on store traffic and sales comp trends due to the winter storms and below average temperatures across the country. It was nice to see sales trends bounce back when the weather became more favorable. For the quarter, the Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands all produced double-digit Retail segment comp sales, with FP Movement leading the way with a 45% increase. Nuuly also delivered robust double-digit revenue growth due to a significant increase in subscribers versus the prior year. All 4 of these brands achieved record fourth quarter revenue, which was partially offset by a negative comp at the Urban Outfitters brand. The growth in Wholesale segment revenue was due to an increase in regular price channel sales at Free People, which was partially offset by a decline in sales at Urban Outfitters. Gross profit dollars increased 20% to $452 million, while our gross profit rate increased by 293 basis points to 30.2%. The improvement in the gross profit rate was primarily due to increased initial margins at Free People and Anthropologie. In fiscal year '24, all 3 brands made significant progress towards our 500 basis points IMU improvement goal, and now have their sights set on completing the goal by Q4 of fiscal '25. Markdowns were flat for the quarter versus last year but were higher than planned in the month of January as Urban Outfitters needed to promote more aggressively than planned to clear through excess inventory. As a result of the additional clearance at Urban Outfitters, their comp inventory is now down 3% on a year-over-year basis and in a better position heading into the spring selling season. Now moving on to SG&A expenses. For the quarter, SG&A increased 11% versus the prior comparable quarter and deleveraged by 58 basis points. The increase in expense and deleverage was primarily related to an increase in marketing and creative expense to support increased sales and continued customer growth, as well as higher incentive-based compensation costs due to the improved company performance. URBN's profit results were even more impressive than our strong sales growth. Total URBN operating income soared 90% above the prior year to $81 million, and earnings jumped 84% to $66 million or $0.69 per diluted share. I will now provide more details by brand, starting with Anthropologie. The Anthropologie team delivered a strong 12% Retail segment comp in Q4. This increase was driven by high single digit positive store comps and low double digit digital comps. By category, apparel and accessories delivered nicely positive Retail segment comps in the quarter, while home was flat. The strong fourth quarter completed an impressive full year of low double digit sales comps for the brand. The impressive sales growth and healthy margin expansion drove record operating profit dollars for the fourth quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2025, the Anthropologie consumer remains optimistic and continues to respond positively to a broad range of occasion and casual categories. The teams transitioned into spring early in January, and the customer is responding well to the fashion newness. The home category continued to see strength in the gift and entertainment category, which was partially offset by a decline in furniture and decor. During the quarter, the team's execution of the brand strategy to target a slightly younger customer continued to gain traction. New customers in the quarter in North America increased by a remarkable 26%. The strength in apparel, accessories and gift entertainment, along with the new customer acquisition, has us optimistic that the Anthropologie brand can continue to drive nicely positive comps in fiscal year '25. Now I will call your attention to Free People. Once again, the Free People team produced an outstanding quarter, with Retail segment comps achieving an impressive 19% gain versus last year. Retail segment comp was driven by double-digit comp growth in both the digital and store channels. During the quarter, the brand achieved strong double-digit growth across apparel, accessories and movement. The FP Movement brand delivered another remarkable quarter, achieving 45% Retail segment growth. Record sales and improved margins helped Free People deliver record fourth quarter and full year operating profit dollars. Early customer response to the brand spring trends has been strong, and new and total customer counts continue to grow at a double-digit rate. We believe the brand's Retail segment performance could be nicely positive in fiscal year 2025. The Free People Wholesale segment sales increased 8% during the quarter, driven by sales gains in department stores. Segment profitability improved significantly from the prior year when the brand had elevated closeout channel sales to reduce inventory levels. We believe Wholesale segment sales could be near-flat in fiscal year 2025, while delivering improved profitability. Now moving on to the Urban Outfitters brand. Urban recorded a 14% Retail segment comp decline in the quarter. UO's negative comp was the result of disappointing performance in both North America and Europe. Global Retail segment comp declines were driven by double-digit declines in both the digital and store channels, and all product categories were negative. When we last spoke, we noted the UO brand had excess inventory entering into the holiday season. This led to significantly higher markdowns during the fourth quarter. The brand made significant improvement on these inventory levels and is entering fiscal year 2025 with leaner inventories than the prior year. With new leadership in place and better inventory control, we believe the brand could deliver gradual comp sales improvements as the year progresses with the first quarter of fiscal 2025, likely looking similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Finally, I will touch on the Nuuly business. Revenue and subscriber growth continued to outperform our expectations. For our rental business, we see the most significant growth in subscribers during the seasonally strong first and third quarters. During the fourth quarter, average subscribers ended at 195,000, growing 56% versus the prior year, and 6% versus the third quarter. As you know, we have reached full capacity in our Pennsylvania fulfillment center. The team began the process of transitioning to our second facility in Raymore, Missouri, in the fourth quarter. This transition led to incremental and some nonrecurring costs in logistics, which will continue into the first quarter and abate in the second quarter. This facility will support future subscriber growth by tripling the brand's capacity. We are pleased to announce the first totes have now shipped out of Raymore, and the brand will continue to ramp up capacity as the first quarter progresses. Let me now review the many milestones we achieved in fiscal year 2024. We delivered 8% sales growth, resulting in a new record of $5.2 billion in sales. Gross profit margin expanded by 370 basis points, culminating and operating profit growth of 70% or $162 million, which drove 86% growth in earnings per diluted share. 4 of our 5 brands delivered double-digit sales gains as well as customer growth and our newest brand and concept, Nuuly, delivered its first ever profitable quarter. We know there is always more work to be done and improvements to be made, but I would be remiss if I didn't congratulate and thank all of our employees for their extraordinary performance in fiscal year 2024. Thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Melanie Marein-Efron, our Chief Financial Officer.\nMelanie Marein-Efron: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will discuss our thoughts on the first quarter and full fiscal year '25. As we begin FY '25, we believe we could deliver low single digit comps for the full year and first quarter, driven by nicely positive comps at Anthropologie and Free People, and mid-double-digit revenue growth at Nuuly. We believe that the UO brand first quarter comp will look similar to the fourth quarter, with gradual improvement as the year progresses. We believe that first quarter total company sales growth could be mid-single digits. Sales growth in Q1 could result from mid-double digit growth of Nuuly segment sales versus last year, and Retail segment comp sales growing in the low single digits. Our growth in the Retail segment and Nuuly segments is likely to be partially offset by a slight sales decline in our Wholesale segment. Based on the current sales performance and plan, we believe our gross profit margins for the first quarter could improve by approximately 25 basis points versus first quarter fiscal year '24. The increase in gross profit rate could be primarily due to higher initial product margins from cross-functional initiatives which will favorably impact initial product margins. We believe that improvements in the initial product margin could be largely offset by higher logistics costs in the first quarter. The planned increase in logistics costs is primarily driven by the transition and startup of the new Nuuly rental fulfillment facility in Missouri. As Frank mentioned, this transition began at the end of fiscal year '24, and will continue into the second quarter, albeit to a lesser extent. When thinking about gross profit margins for the full year, it is important to remember our 3-year plan to recapture 500 basis points of initial product margin from the base established in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. This plan was announced 2 years ago on this call. This year, FY '25 is the third year of our initiative. In FY '23 and FY '24, we made tremendous progress as a result of lower inbound freight costs and our cross-functional initiatives to improve initial product margins. and there still is more product margin opportunity to be realized. We believe that gross profit margins in FY '25 could improve by approximately 50 to 100 basis points versus the full year fiscal '24. In FY '25, improved gross profit margins could be driven by higher initial product margins at all brands and the opportunity for lower markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand as a result of more tightly controlled inventory in the second half of the year. Based on our current sales performance and financial plan, we believe total growth in SG&A could outpace sales growth for the quarter and year. The deleverage of SG&A primarily relates to the Urban Outfitters brand. While we have reduced expenses at the Urban Outfitters brand, we do not believe it is prudent to reduce expenses at the rate of negative sales performance that believe could occur in FY '25. The growth in SG&A primarily relates to increases in marketing expenses to support growth in customers and sales in the Free People, FP Movement, Anthropologie and Nuuly brands. In Q1, SG&A could grow in the low double digits, while a year will be much closer to our sales growth. We believe the delta between SG&A and sales growth rates will be larger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. As always, if sales performance fluctuates, we maintain a certain level of variable SG&A spending that we can fluctuate up and down depending on how our business is performing. Our annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 24% for the year and 25% for the first quarter. Now moving on to inventory. As a result of the more reliable supply chain with faster speed and increased reliability, we've been able to bring product in closer to demand in the past year. This has allowed us to speed up our product turns in FY '24, and manage to a lower weeks of supply. In the coming year, we will continue to be focused on increasing our product turns. We believe that our inventory levels could grow at a rate below sales growth. As you may have noticed, our FY '24 capital expenditure came in approximately $35 million lower than planned spend. FY '24 capital spend was lower than planned due to timing of FY '24 project cash flows, which have shifted into FY '25. For FY '25 capital expenditure is planned at approximately $210 million, including $35 million of timing shift of capital spend from FY '24. The FY '25 capital project spend is broken down as follows: approximately 50% is related to retail store expansion and support; approximately 25% is related to logistics capacity investments, including the Nuuly rental fulfillment center in Raymore, Missouri, which Frank referenced; and the remaining 25% would be our normal capital investment supporting IT, home office and logistics operations. We will be opening approximately 58 new stores and closing approximately 21 stores during fiscal year '25. Our net new store growth is being driven by growth in FP Movement, Free People and Anthropologie stores. During FY '25, we plan on opening 25 FP Movement stores, 13 Free People stores and 14 Anthropologie stores. Based on our current plans, we plan to repurchase shares to, at a minimum, offset the dilution in FY '25. Of course, share repurchase activity will be contingent on market conditions and Board of Director approval. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Dick Hayne, Chief Executive Officer of URBN.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you, Mel. As you heard from Frank and Mel, 4 of our brands, Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement and Nuuly all delivered strong Q4 performances. And given their current trends, I'm optimistic about their prospects for this year, we believe each of these brands can continue to post healthy comps, albeit at a somewhat lower rate than last year. Our fifth brand, Urban Outfitters, continued to fall short of our expectations, with double-digit negative comps in Q4. And they remain negative so far in February. Today, I'll discuss the opportunities we see for sales growth this year and say a few words about our current view of the consumer. Entering our fiscal year 2025, we enjoyed 2 young, fast-growing brands plus 2 larger brands that posted excellent comps and gained market share last year. For FY '25, we are planning a similar outcome for these 4 brands, but expect comp sales to moderate slightly. In Q1, we are planning total Retail segment comps to be around 3%, and total URBN revenues to increase by mid-single digits. I'll now discuss each brand, starting with Anthropologie. The focus at Anthro has been on modernizing the product assortment, enhancing the store and digital selling environments and providing inspirational creative content. This has allowed the brand to grow its customer base across multiple age demographics, with a particular emphasis on capturing additional customers under 40. To reach that younger customer, the team modernized core categories like denim and dresses, elevated the market brands offered and accentuated product categories that resonate especially well with younger customers, like intimate apparel, accessories and shoes. These efforts saw great success in fiscal '24, and helped to drive a 12% comp increase and a 26% increase in new customers in Q4. Building on this success, for spring, the team has expanded 2 new product concepts, with dedicated shop-in-shops inside 50 Anthropologie stores and featured these concepts on anthropologie.com. The first shop consists of vacation-ready fashion essentials like sundresses, cover-ups, sandals, shorts, accessories and skin care. The second shop features an expanded range of intimates, lounge wear, sleep and beauty essentials. These two concepts are enjoying outsized comp gains and helping to drive nicely positive Retail segment comp increases in February. Overall, we believe the Anthropologie Group can deliver mid-single digit comps for the year and the first half. Moving to the Free People brand, where FP Movement continues to lead this brand's remarkable growth. Last year, Movement achieved Retail segment growth of 53%, and has continued to deliver powerful double-digit retail segment comp growth in February this year. Movement continues to focus on growing its brand recognition and broadening its reach across all 3 channels of distribution. Last year, Movement's 38 stand-alone stores far surpassed our performance expectations, with average sales per square foot exceeding those at the average Free People locations. We believe this provides an opportunity to open many additional stores and increase the size of new stores to approximately 2,600 gross square feet or 30% larger than the current fleet average. Our data confirms that opening new brick-and-mortar location not only augments brand recognition, but also list digital sales in the surrounding ZIP codes. In FY '25, the team plans to open an additional 25 Movement stores, a 66% increase over the current base. We believe that Movement has the highest store count opportunity of all URBN brands, both in North America and globally. The wholesale channel provides Movement with an additional method of building name recognition. Partnering with premiere activity-based specialty accounts gives the brand additional credibility within the activewear space and helps to drive engagement. The Free People collection business also plans to deliver solid growth. This year, the team will execute a growth strategy centered on attracting additional digital customers through more robust marketing efforts, while expanding the product offering in areas like footwear and accessories. The brand is also expanding its sub-brand, free-est, which concentrates on effortless attire with a beach sensibility. To that end, in mid-February, the brand opened a 2,800 square free-est pop-up shop in Palm Beach, Florida, that is generating sales significantly above our very optimistic plan. While it's still early days for this sub-brand, expanding the free-est concept might provide yet another growth opportunity for the Free People brand in the future. Stay tuned. I now turn your attention to Nuuly, URBN's fast-growing apparel rental business. Nuuly delivered an exceptionally strong fiscal year, outpacing expectations for both top and bottom line performance and recording its first profitable quarter in Q3. Faster-than-planned subscriber growth during the year accelerated the brand's need to invest in a second fulfillment center. That center located outside Kansas City is now operational and will slowly ramp up fulfillment in the first quarter. Opening this facility has created additional onetime expenses. Thus in Q4, Nuuly incurred a small operating loss, and we expect a slightly larger loss in Q1. However, we plan for the brand to return to profitability in Q2, and be profitable for the full year. At full capacity, the new facility will allow the total number of subscribers to more than triple from current levels. We are acutely aware that our single largest opportunity to improve URBN's bottom line is turning around the Urban brand in North America. To that end, we are highly focused on building the team, improving the product offering and strengthening our marketing offer. As I announced earlier, Shea Jensen has joined the UO team as President of North America. Additionally, Dmitri Siegel has rejoined the team as Chief Creative and Digital Officer. I believe these 2 leaders, working with their teams, and Sheila, will spearhead the brand's renaissance in North America. Our plan calls for the brand to deliver slow but steady progress over the course of this year and reach flat comps in Q4. Turning now to the health of our customers. We believe they, as a group, are in good shape. They're not as exuberant as they were when first coming out of the pandemic. They don't have as many weddings and events to attend. They are less apt to move and have recently refurbished their living spaces. So demand for categories like dressier footwear and home furnishings are trending softer. But they do enjoy a secure job and are earning more money than ever. They tend to be optimistic, want the latest fashion and are willing to spend some of those extra earnings to enjoy them. Their mood and financial conditions create an environment conducive to our brand's success. Our job, as always, is to ensure that we give them the products and experience they exceed their expectations. We believe we are poised to do just that. In closing, I thank our brand and shared service leaders, their merchant, creative and operating teams and our 27,000 associates worldwide. They delivered an outstanding record-setting performance in FY '24. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the globe. Finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I now turn the call over for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.\nLorraine Maikis: My question is on the Urban Outfitters brand. Now that Shea and Dmitri are on board, how quickly can they impact the product and then the marketing message?\nSheila Harrington: Lorraine, I can take that. I feel like jumping in, Shea and Dmitri are highly focused on our back-to-school time frame and being such a pivotal point for the Urban Outfitters brand. So their focus is really on a larger impact in Q3 although I can say they're dissecting all parts of the business to affect as much as they can immediately.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: So Dick, could you elaborate on the positive response that you cited to early spring offering. And then larger picture, you spoke to the successful customer base expansion at Anthropologie. I guess, what do you see as key to the turnaround at the Urban brand from here?\nRichard Hayne: Okay, Matthew. I'll try to do both of those things. The key to the Urban brand, as we said all along, is having the leadership in place. And secondarily, I'm happy to announce that we're -- have undertaken a comprehensive brand review, and we're looking at all areas of the business. So I can't tell you what is going to come out of that review, but I will say, having the leadership in place is the #1 element that will help the brand turnaround. And sorry the...\nSheila Harrington: Spring.\nRichard Hayne: Oh, spring. Well, the way I judge that is by sales, and sales are trending reasonably in line with Q4 sales. And so I would say that she, and in Urban's case, he, are responding very much in line with what they're responding the prior year, which was very good. So we're seeing good comps and that's a tribute to the selection and the assortment that the brand leaders have done.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.\nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Dick, my question is for you on, obviously, Urban Outfitters. Wondering if there's any thought that perhaps the usefulness or coming down in age range on Anthropologie maybe impacting sort of those at the higher end of Urban. And then what would make you kind of consider maybe rationalizing the store base at Urban Outfitters? And then for Melanie, on the gross margin, can you just help us understand Anthro, Free People, they seem to be a peak operating margin profitability. So how much further do you think that's sustainable? And how much further can the overall URBN gross margins go if you get a turn at UO?\nRichard Hayne: Okay, Adrienne. Even though there's more than one question there, we'll try to answer them. On Urban Outfitters' overlap with Anthropologie, we have explored that a number of times through focus groups, and we have found that there's actually very little. Now there are some categories of products like bedding that we sometimes see some overlap. But I think that's fairly minor. I think there's more overlap between Urban and Free People. And given the current fashion proclivity for femininity, I think that Free People has always been known for that femininity and we could see some bleed from Urban customers into the Free People brand. But Anthropologie, probably not. Mel?\nFrank Conforti: This is Frank, Adrienne. As it relates to gross profit, as I think we did say in our prepared remarks, we think all brands have continued IMU opportunity. So obviously, that would add to gross profit. And I think there's always markdown rate opportunities as it relates to better inventory control and speed, which can happen at all brands. But obviously, the biggest impact that we're looking for this year is for that to come from the Urban Outfitters brand. But yes, we still think that there's still opportunity for all brands to improve upon their rates.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.\nPaul Lejuez: Just a follow-up on the IMU opportunity at all brands. Could you just dig in there a little bit about what exactly will be some of those initiatives that are set to kind of improve the IMU this year outside of UO or just trying to understand that, kind of product-cost related? Is there anything you could dig in on the specific initiatives? And then secondly, on the Free People Movement business, I know you recently entered, Dick, just wondering how the business is performing there. How many doors are you -- in it, and whether there's opportunity to expand into some other national retailers?\nRichard Hayne: Okay. I'll try to start that with IMU improvement. Our initiative has had a majority of success due to reduced transportation costs. Now that reduced transportation costs was partially due to reduced rates in ocean and air freight over the last 2 years. So that drove a lot. But we have also driven a lot of our air freight that we used to do and converted that to ocean freight, which, as you know, is much less expensive. In addition to that, we've increased our internal brand penetration, which has a greater IMU than what we can get in the market. We have concentrated on to fill rates in our containers, trying to get more product into each container. We've looked at purchasing -- or we are doing -- purchase more fabric and yarn and other raw materials directly from the mills. And then in addition to that, we've leveraged multiple styles across the same fabric, so that the fabric expense is less. Going forward, we have additional process improvements that are -- will be a result of better use of technology and automation. So those are the things that we have done and are continuing to do. But like Frank and Mel both said, we believe that the 500 basis points that we're delivering in the 3 years is a great start. But there's more to come. Oh, Sheila?\nSheila Harrington: Okay. I can hop on regards to Movement. We've been really pleased with our partnership with DICK'S Sporting Goods. I feel like it's given us a lot of credibility in this active lifestyle space, along with some very strong other brands in the market. So we feel really proud of -- we love how they take care of the brand and the product within the store space. And I think that partnership hopefully will continue to be very positive going forward. As far as the rest of our wholesale intentions with FP Movement, they focus around 3 areas that the active lifestyle is focused on outdoor, outdoor, run and studio space. And we believe each of these has a huge opportunity within the wholesale channel to thrive and represent the brand very strongly.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.\nDana Telsey: Dick, if you talked about the study that the Urban Outfitters division is undergoing, are you using an external firm to do that strategic study with you? What's the time frame of when you expect to have the results of that study? And is it holistic in examining every part of the business? And then just lastly on the margins and inventory levels, what are you seeing from any issues in the Red Sea, is that delayed? Is it particularly home? Or how are you thinking about it?\nRichard Hayne: Okay, Dana. The Urban Outfitters brand, as I said, we've begun a comprehensive brand review. We're looking at all aspects of the business from who the target customer is to the store footprint and fleet size and all aspects of brand marketing. There are a number of other topics that we're doing under the review. I think we've listed about 9 or 10 so far. And we think the study will take the better part of a few months, and we're more than happy to update you on our progress in future calls.\nFrank Conforti: And Dana, this is Frank. As it relates to the Red Sea, just -- I want to note that we have included the impact -- estimated impact of the Red Sea in our planned expenses for fiscal '25. So those impacts are baked into our plan for the 50 to 100 basis points of gross profit margin improvement. I think right now, what we're seeing is reliability in the region, which is good. And what that means is that we know where our ships are and what our costs are. That wasn't the case when things first went down over there. What I would say, unfortunately, though, is the ships are obviously taking extra time and costing a bit more as most are currently taking the long way around the southern tip of Africa.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.\nMarni Shapiro: I have a couple of quick Nuuly questions. I guess, how quickly -- you talked about the new fulfillment center. I'm curious how quickly you think you will come up to speed so that it's really kind of chugging along. And then could you talk a little bit about the Nuuly shopper? Are you seeing a lot of cross between the shopper of Free People, Anthro, I'm guessing a little bit less Urban, or are they new to the company? If you could just talk a little bit about that? Are they driving -- is it easier to kind of grab them from the other brands? Or are these new people coming to you that have not shopped with you before?\nDavid Hayne: Yes, Marni, thanks for the Nuuly questions. I'll start with the customer first. We do see some overlap with customers that come in to Nuuly from the -- from our sister brands, it's a reasonably healthy overlap, but we do see a fair amount of customers that come into URBN for the first time, which has been a really nice surprise. So it's a little bit of both. It's a good healthy mix of customers that come in from the brand as well as come in new to URBN. In regards to the Missouri building, it's actually up and operational now. The building has been operating for the better part of the last 4 or 5 weeks, in terms of actually processing inventory, getting units out the door and actually shipping Nuuly's to customers. It's a tricky process in that we have to move a fair amount of inventory ahead of the subscribers that are being moved to that building. But now that, that has occurred, we're in the process of migrating subscribers to the Missouri building and actually shipping customer orders out from there. So that transition will happen through the better part of Q1. By the end of Q1, we anticipate we'll be operating about 1/4 of our subscriber base out of that building. And we think we'll see some of the incremental costs that we saw in Q4 carry through into Q1 and slightly into Q2 as we ramp up that building. But I do want to reiterate that we just -- we feel very excited about this growth opportunity at Nuuly, that the building is a big milestone for the brand. We feel even more encouraged about the opportunity at Nuuly to be a very sizable business. We think there is a large and growing market for rental apparel in the United States that we are tapping into. And we do think, as we've said before, that this could be the next URBN $1 billion brand. And this building is really a testament. The investment in this building is really a testament to that resolved and that excitement. So as we've said before, we're going to be tripling our network capacity up to 600,000 subscribers. Our new building will be much more automated than our existing building, which should lead to efficiencies. And we think we'll see some delivery expense improvement as we operate more out of this building, as well as a faster delivery experience for customers. So it should result in a much improved situation and a lot of headroom for the brand.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.\nAlex Straton: Perfect. I just have two for you. One is on Free People Movement. Can you just elaborate on the positioning of that brand from a competitive standpoint? And who do you think of the peers? And what you think about the size of that business over time? And then my second question is just on gross margin and that 500 bps of opportunity over time. What is the ceiling? So should Urban be going to 35% gross margin over time? I'm just trying to understand where we're at exactly, make sure that's all tied up.\nSheila Harrington: Okay. I'll take the first question. Around FP Movement, we believe, as Dick alluded to, that this brand has the opportunity to be one of the largest, certainly larger than our Free People brand. We think it welcomes a great deal of consumers with being true to its roots, which is an active lifestyle, it's a merge of fashion along with performance. And I think how it differentiates itself is just that, the idea that you can be fashionable and have a performance point of view, as well as being highly female-centric brand. I think there are other brands that I think we would say we're sharing our wallet share with. But for the -- for our focus, it's around the female athlete, female consumer, and that's where we plan to stay focused to win.\nFrank Conforti: And then, Alex, this is Frank. On the -- sorry, didn't mean to cut you off, Sheila. On gross profit margin, as we said, we think we have about 50 to 100 basis points of opportunity this year. As Dick noted, we do think we'll hit that 500 basis point mark by Q4 of this year, but we don't think we're done at IMU, we still think that there's some other cross-functional initiatives to unlock, and we do think technology is going to play a big role in that. I would also say, relative to the company, we don't think the Urban brand will be fully there yet from a markdown rate perspective. And we'll probably still have for the full year elevated markdown rates and opportunity for continued improvement there. I do think it's important also just to take a pause. We've been talking a lot about getting to 10% operating profit and hitting that double-digit mark here as a company. Obviously, fiscal '24, hitting 270 basis points improvement in rate and operating profit and 70% growth in operating profit dollars leaves us confident, and then we talked about the gains and opportunities yet to come yet here in fiscal '25. But speaking to the long term, obviously, turning UO is our biggest opportunity. When that business recovers, it's going to contribute significantly to our increased profitability, but UO is not the only opportunity, right? FP Movement, which delivered 53% Retail segment growth this past year is running a very nice double-digit operating profit rate. So as that brand continues to grow, and as Sheila just mentioned, we think the ceiling is pretty high on that brand. That's going to contribute nicely to URBN. The Free People brand in total is our most profitable brand on a rate basis, and continues to grow at an exceptional pace. If they continue to gain larger penetration of URBN, they're also going to contribute to rate growth as well as dollars growth. And then Anthropologie delivered record operating profit dollars this year, in fiscal '24, and I know Anthro believes that they can -- the brand can continue to deliver more and is planning to do so in fiscal '25. And certainly, lastly, as Dave mentioned, we believe Nuuly could deliver their first year of operating profit this year, and could continue to build from there and growing -- helping URBN to grow operating profit for years. So we think there's gross profit margin opportunity. And then I think what I'm just trying to stress here is there's a lot of levers here where we think we can continue to grow our operating profit dollars and rate for several years to come.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.\nIrwin Boruchow: Just wanted to -- Dick, just I want to go back to the comp guidance. I don't mean to nitpick, but you had said 3% comp guide for 1Q, but I think in the answer, you said spring was trending reasonably in line with 4Q. I'm just trying to understand, are you running at 3%? Are you running above that and expecting a deceleration? I just want to make sure I understood what the quarter-to-date look like.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. Ike, good catch. Our February sales results right now remains strong, and they're very similar to the fourth quarter results. But as I said before, it's a touch softer than Q4 results, both by total and by brand. We're currently running slightly ahead of our Q1 plan, which calls for a total Retail segment comp sales of 3%. So is it going to come down a bit and hit the 3% or be slightly above? I can't tell you that. If I could, I'd probably be in the investment world, not here.\nOperator: We do have time for one final question. And that will come from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research Associates.\nJanet Kloppenburg: My question is a little bit different than Adrienne. She worried about cannibalization from the high end for UO, and sometimes, Dick and Sheila, I worry about it from the low end like from SHEIN and some of these other players out there. So I wanted your thoughts there. I don't know what direction the Urban Outfitters' price points are going, but I'd love a view on that. And then for Melanie and/or Frank. I know you said gross profit up about 50 to 100, and some SG&A leverage. So are we talking about operating margins up 30% to 40%, or something higher than that for fiscal 2025?\nRichard Hayne: Okay, Janet, I'll talk about SHEIN and -- versus Anthropologie as a direction for UO. As I said, I think that while there is a little bit of bleed from the UO customer into Anthropologie, I don't think it's great. I do think there's bleed from the Urban Outfitters customer into Free People, and Free People price points are reasonably in line with Anthropologie. So from a price point perspective, yes, I think some of our customers are trading up or, let me say, are spending a reasonable amount of money. But they're also buying on places like SHEIN and other lower price-point companies. To that end, we are beginning an initiative just to test, very small test, how we can perhaps rearrange some of our concept to design to production to a customer, not direct to customer, but how we can speed that up and even though we think that we are one of the fastest production to customer in our space. We think that we can be faster and faster, I always, as I say, time equals money. So we think we can be more efficient and bring down at least the costs. Now having said that, we don't know exactly where the retail costs are going to go. And that's part of our -- the study that we have undertaken to determine where we want to be with Urban. But I think that you're right to point out that the lower-cost people are taking some market share. And I think some of the higher-priced people are taking market share. So I think that we have to just decide what we want to be and fix that, and then deliver the product and the marketing that will keep our market share intact.\nFrank Conforti: Janet, on the gross profit margin, we think our -- excuse me, overall operating profit margin. So we think gross profit could be about 50 to 100 basis points for the year, with a slight deleverage in SG&A that would eat into that number just a little bit. I think what Melanie had said was, right now, we're -- based on how our plans are built, SG&A could be about 1% above what our sales plans are for the year. So still just a little bit of deleverage eating into that 50 to 100 basis points, where that all shakes out will depend on where the 50 to 100 shake out for the year.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. I think that, that completes the call. I thank you all very much for joining, and I look forward to talking to you in a few months.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Urban Outfitters, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal ‘24 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Oona McCullough, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Ms. McCullough, you may begin.\nOona McCullough: Good afternoon, and welcome to the URBN third quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. Earlier this afternoon, the Company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three- and nine-month period ending October 31, 2023. The following discussions may include forward-looking statements. Please note that actual results may differ materially from those statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is contained in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On today’s call, you will hear from Frank Conforti, Co-President and COO, URBN; Dave Hayne Chief Technology Officer and President of Nuuly; Sheila Harrington Global Chief Executive Officer of Free People and Urban Outfitters; Melanie Marein-Efron, Chief Financial Officer, URBN; and Richard Hayne, CEO, URBN. Following that, we will be pleased to address your questions. For more detailed commentary on our quarterly performance and the text of today’s conference call, please refer to our Investor Relations website at www.urbn.com. I will now turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Conforti: Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, and thank you to everyone who joined our call today. I will begin my commentary with comments on our operating results for the third quarter and then discuss more detailed notes by brand. Overall, the third quarter performed largely in line with our expectations as discussed on the August call. URBN delivered strong sales growth of 9% to a record $1.3 billion for the third quarter. URBN sales growth was driven by a 6% Retail segment comp and robust growth from Nuuly which added $30 million in revenue during the quarter. Retail segment comp was driven by high-single-digit comps in the DTC channel and mid-single-digit comps in stores. Sales comps in both channels were the result of higher traffic and increased AUR. The Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands all produced double-digit sales growth in stores and on-line, with FP Movement leading the way with a comp sales increase of 49%. Each of these brands achieved record third quarter brand revenue, which more than offset a negative comp at the Urban Outfitters brand. URBN’s bottom line results were even more impressive than our strong sales growth. Total URBN operating income soared 90% higher than the prior year to $109 million and earnings jumped 123% to $83 million or $0.88 per diluted share. Our earnings growth was driven in part by a 27% increase in gross profit dollars while gross profit rate surged by over 500 basis points. The improvement in gross profit rate was due to significantly improved initial margins as well as lower markdown rates at all brands. I will now provide more details by brand, with a little help from Dave Hayne on Nuuly.\nDave Hayne: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I’m happy to provide a brief update on our rental subscription business, Nuuly. Judging by our Q3 results, our model of a monthly rental subscription certainly seems to be resonating with our target customer. We often hear from new subscribers that they first learned about Nuuly from their friends or family, and after a month or two of renting from us, they then become vocal advocates for renting, and go on to tell all their friends about Nuuly. It is this viral word-of-mouth, paired with an attractive value proposition and strong execution that has helped us grow quickly in our first few years of business, and Q3 was a continuation of this trend. In the third quarter, Nuuly drove $65.5 million in revenue, which was an increase of 86% from last year. This revenue growth was driven by a net increase of nearly 39,000 subscribers in the quarter, up to a total of 198,000 active subscribers at quarter’s end. As you may remember from our second quarter call, we spoke about two milestones relating to the Nuuly business: one, that we thought it was possible we could reach 200,000 subscribers by the end of the year, a goal we have now achieved in November; and two, that we believed we would see our first quarter of profit in the back half of this year. Today, I’m very pleased to share that Nuuly saw an operating profit in the third quarter. This is a goal the team has been pushing very hard to achieve, and it makes me proud to see everyone’s hard work recognized today. As we look forward, there is much to be excited about in Nuuly’s future. With the strong partnership of our sister brands Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters as well as over 400 other partner brands we have curated what we believe is the most compelling rental clothing assortment on the market. With the help of our robust digital platform, driving both the customer experience and fulfillment center operations, Nuuly is very well positioned to further enhance our rental program with exciting new features that can drive higher customer value. And the opening of our Raymore, Missouri fulfillment center in Q4 provides the business with the urgently needed operating capacity to grow well into the future, supporting in total over 3 times our current subscriber count. So, I am very excited today to be reporting our first profit as a young company, with the best rental assortment in the business, with a home-grown digital platform that empowers us to drive more program value, and with the infrastructure to realize continued growth, and most importantly, with an incredible team to help us realize this future. Thank you, I will now turn the call back over to Frank.\nFrank Conforti: Thank you, Dave. Congratulations to you and the entire Nuuly team on this incredible milestone. I know we are all confident there are many more notable milestones to come. Now moving on to Anthropologie. The Anthropologie team delivered an exceptionally strong 13% Retail segment comp in Q3. This increase was driven by double-digit positive store and digital comps. Both store and digital comps were driven by increased traffic and strong growth in regular price sales. Strong sales, improvements in IMU, and low third quarter mark down rates all led to record third quarter operating profit dollars for Anthropologie. The impressive quarterly performance was largely driven by apparel and accessories. Within apparel, the Anthropologie customer continues to respond favorably to fashion newness. In the quarter Anthropologie launched its largest marketing campaign to date, Falling for Anthro, leveraging a range of talent including celebrity Phoebe Tonkin, brand ambassadors and influencers. The campaign was a resounding success resulting in strong increases in brand impressions, sessions and new customer growth. The brands incredible execution across marketing, product and operations has helped to drive over 25% growth in new customers in North America. The strength across all apparel and accessory categories, along with new customer acquisition has resulted in a nicely positive start to the holiday season. Turning to Free People. Free People delivered yet another historically exceptional quarter, once again achieving record sales and profits in the third quarter. Retail segment comps at Free People finished the quarter up a robust 23%. The Free People brand produced a strong 18% comp, and the FP Movement brand produced an impressive 49% comp. Total Retail segment comp was driven by double-digit comps in the store and digital channels. These double-digit comps were driven by strong traffic growth in both channels due in part to excellent marketing, product and operations execution. The strength of the Free People assortments, marketing campaigns and store experience has continued in the fourth quarter, resulting in a strong Retail segment start to the holiday season. Free People Wholesale segment sales decreased 4% during the third quarter. The decrease in sales was a result of weakness in department store accounts partially offset by growth in specialty store accounts. Although wholesale sales remain slightly negative, profitability has returned to a healthy level. Now moving on to Urban Outfitters. Urban recorded a negative 14% Retail segment comp in Q3. UO’s negative comp was the result of disappointing performance in North America and Europe. In North America, comp store and digital channel sales were low double-digit negative. The brand is experiencing some improvements in their assortment and marketing execution but not enough to move the needle just yet. In Europe, the weakness was concentrated in the UK while the rest of Europe continued to see positive Retail segment comps. Due to the weaker than expected sales during the third quarter, as well as current forecasts for the fourth quarter, inventory levels at the Urban Outfitters brand are elevated versus where we would like them to be. These inventory levels will lead to higher markdowns than originally planned during the holiday season for the brand. I will now turn the call to Sheila Harrington who will speak to the Free People, Free People Movement and Urban Outfitters brands.\nSheila Harrington: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to provide an update for the Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands. First, I will discuss Free People and FP Movement. As Frank reported, the total Free People brand had an exceptional quarter with total brand revenue up 18%. The consistently strong growth over the past few years at Free People can be attributed to the team’s maniacal focus on the consumer and the use of creativity in product, experience, and marketing. We believe the brand can continue to achieve growth by expanding its reach and product offering. Distorting into select labels, including ‘Intimately FP’, ‘Free-est’ and ‘We the Free’ along with our core Free People label, will allow us to complete the customer’s lifestyle looks and welcome more people into the brand. We the Free enjoyed robust growth this quarter. The We The Free label offers heritage inspired staples, which capture the spirit of FP through hand touched details and wash. The We The Free label includes several product categories, but we believe the significant growth opportunity exists in denim, accessories and footwear. It currently accounts for over 20% of the brand’s Retail segment net sales and is experiencing outsized growth. We plan for this label and the denim category particularly to be a meaningful part of our continued growth. As mentioned, marketing is key factor in FP’s growth. The brand launched several successful marketing campaigns during the quarter and throughout the year, targeting consumers across multiple social platforms and achieved double-digit growth of new customers in Q3. Free People’s revenue is currently concentrated in North America with 148 stores and a strong digital business. However, we believe, with its unique aesthetic and strong fashion handwriting, Free People has the opportunity to be a larger global brand. Just over five years ago, we opened our first European store in Amsterdam. Today we operate 12 stores in Europe with locations in the Netherlands, France, and the UK. Our total international business grew by 34% and was profitable in Q3. We believe that strong growth could continue over the next several years. Moving on to FP Movement. FP Movement offers women’s activewear at the intersection of fashion and function and looks to redefine the female activewear market by infusing a strong feminine voice into a business long dominated by male sensibilities. The FP Movement design and buying teams have found unique opportunities to express this feminine voice and define the brand successfully. One example is the creation and marketing of the Righteous Runsie, a one-piece performance product the team created to capture white space in the activewear market. The teams continue to develop and strive for excellence in performance pieces for Studio, Run and Outdoors. After experimenting with shop-in-shops in Free People stores for several years, we decided to open our first standalone Movement store in 2020. Since then, we’ve opened additional stores and currently have 37 locations in the US. Four-wall performance has greatly exceeded our expectations. Sales productivity per square foot as well as overall store profitability of these standalone Movement stores are performing at similar levels to the Free People brand despite Movement being a young brand that is still building brand awareness. Given the success of the current store fleet, we plan to open at least 25 additional FP Movement stores in fiscal year ‘25. The Wholesale team delivered over 60% year-over-year growth this quarter. While achieving this growth, they also ensured we are selling to the correct partners who are aligned with our brand aesthetics and values. The Marketing and Digital teams not only connected with consumers across various platforms and with strong brand athletic ambassadors, but they also connected with customers in person through experiential events in local markets such as organized runs and workout events. These efforts led to over 50% new customer growth for the FP Movement brand in the quarter. The success of the FP Movement continues to build across all three distribution channels, retail, digital, and wholesale. Total revenues grew by 55% in the third quarter. We’re still in the early stages of growth, but our eyes are on our goal of achieving $1 billion in annual revenue. Thanks to Meg and the teams at both Free People and FP Movement for helping produce such amazing results in Q3 and your continued passion for the brand and our consumer. Turning to the Urban Outfitters brand. On our last call we noted some improvement in women’s and men’s apparel comps in stores during the early back-to-school season. While the trend in apparel comps did improve, and in stores, our men’s business was positive for the quarter, total Retail segment comp improvement fell short of our goals. We know there is much more work to be done. Negative traffic trends within stores and online remain our single largest challenge, and we know we have declined in consideration for our target consumer. In order to change the trajectory of the Urban Outfitters business, our teams have identified three priorities. They are curating the right mix of products from meaningful national and emerging brands, improving the relevancy of our internally generated brand products, and connecting with and inspiring our customers where they are. Let me expand on each of these priorities. First, Urban Outfitters has always been a Brand of Brands. We rely on offering a compelling assortment of national and emerging brands to drive traffic and sales. We need to modernize our brand offering to be more relevant to our Gen Z consumer. This has been an important part of differentiating Urban from its competitors and we believe this assortment has been off-pitch since the pandemic. Some successes in our current business with popular brands, brand collaborations, and unique offerings within our external brands reinforce this belief. Each merchant team across all divisions is currently reviewing their brand portfolio and working with new brands to build the most relevant mix possible. Second, the continued development and evolution of our internal proprietary products remains critical to our long-term growth and profitability. Strong own brand product provides us with the ability to distort into the right items for our consumers with the right price architecture. Recent successes within the apparel business support when we get this price value correct, we see strong response from the consumer. This fall we were able to distort into a more feminine sensibility with labels such as Kimchi Blue and Silence and Noise. This feminine attribute showed higher productivity and drove an outsized percentage of women’s apparel. Third, is how and where we connect with our consumer. Historically Urban Outfitters has been known to be early adopters in fashion, and in marketing. We know we got behind prior to the pandemic and missed the opportunity to follow our consumers when they changed their platform preferences. We need to develop inspiring and relevant content and meet the consumer where they are, be it on YouTube, TikTok, or in our stores. We have begun to see progress, with sequential improvement throughout the quarter on new, reactivated, and total digital customers. While we are gaining momentum, rebuilding this relationship with the consumer will take time. I am convinced that our laser focus on our target consumer and executing on our three priorities will lead to a return to long-term growth and profitability for the brand. I am grateful to our teams for their commitment and dedication to Urban Outfitters. Now turning your attention to the Urban brand in Europe. Total Retail segment sales in Europe delivered growth in Q3. Positive Retail segment sales were driven by new store openings while comp sales were negative. By geography, business on the mainland was comp positive in both channels while sales in the UK were more challenged. We believe our connection with consumers across Europe remains strong, and we have an opportunity to continue to grow our brand in this region. Tomorrow, our first flagship Urban Outfitters store opens in Madrid on Gran Via, which boasts one of the highest pedestrian traffic counts in the city. The store is housed in a repurposed cinema and commands unparalleled street visibility. Strategic openings such as this will be key to increasing the Urban brand’s name recognition which should also drive greater digital penetration. Congratulations to our European teams on this momentous opening, along with the other first to market openings this past year. And I would like to say thank you to our total Urban Outfitters global teams for their passion, hard work and drive to service our consumer both in stores and digitally around the world. I will now turn the call over to Melanie.\nMelanie Marein-Efron: Thank you, Sheila and good afternoon, everyone. Now, I will discuss our thoughts on the fourth quarter and fiscal year ‘24 financial performance. Consumer demand in October slowed slightly versus the first two months of the third quarter. November sales have started off similar to October. Based on the start to the quarter, we believe fourth quarter total company sales growth could be in the mid-single digits. Sales growth in Q4 could result from low-single-digit growth in Retail segment comp sales and high double-digit growth of Nuuly segment sales versus last year. Our growth in the Retail and Nuuly segments is likely to be partially offset by sales decline in our Wholesale segment similar to Q3. Now on to gross profit margin. Based on current sales performance and plan, we believe URBN’s gross margin rate for the fourth quarter could improve by approximately 300 basis points compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit margin could be primarily driven by higher initial product margins from lower inbound freight as well as cross functional initiatives which will favorably impact product margins. Now moving on to SG&A expenses. We believe SG&A growth for the fourth quarter could increase in the high single digits. Our planned growth in SG&A could be primarily driven by higher overall payroll due to increased store payroll expenses and higher incentive pay from improved company performance. In addition, we expect marketing expenses could be higher versus last year to support growth in customers and sales. As always, if sales performance fluctuates, we maintain a certain level of variable SG&A spending that we can adjust up and down depending on how our business is performing. We are currently planning our effective tax rate to be approximately 26.5% for the fourth quarter. Now moving onto inventory. We believe that inventory levels in the fourth quarter could grow at a rate below sales growth. We have made significant progress this year controlling our inventory to sales ratio and expect to continue that trend into next year. Capital expenditures for the fiscal year are planned at approximately $235 million. The spend is primarily related to investments in additional distribution facilities. Earlier this year, we opened our highly automated omni fulfillment facility in Kansas City, Kansas. In addition, we are investing in a new rental fulfillment facility in Missouri within the Kansas City region. We are targeting to open this facility in the beginning of fiscal year ‘25. Lastly, we’ll be opening approximately 27 new stores and closing approximately 22 stores during fiscal year ‘24. As a reminder, the forgoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The Company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Now, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Dick.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you, Mel, and good afternoon, everyone. As you’ve heard from my colleagues, four of our five brands delivered outstanding results in Q3. The Free People, FP Movement and Anthropologie brands all set new third quarter records for both sales and profits. The Nuuly brand posted record active subscribers and revenues, adding $30 million in additional revenues during the quarter. Nuuly also achieved a huge milestone in Q3 by recording their first quarterly profit. All of this as they celebrated only their fourth anniversary since launching the concept. Moving on to an overview of our fourth quarter prospects, there’s been much market chatter about a slowdown in consumer spending. As Melanie reported, our brands did experience a slight moderation in demand beginning in early October. I want to emphasize the word ‘slight’. November-to-date business is in line with October results and customers continue to choose fashion newness as their preferred purchase and are willing to pay full price for what they want. We’re still planning Q4 Retail segment comps at both the Anthropologie and Free People brands to remain double-digit positive and the Urban brand to show some improvement but remain negative. Our Q4 plan calls for the Company’s total Retail segment to produce comps of 3%. As we prepare to enter our fiscal year 2025, we enjoy two young brands which have produced strong revenue growth this past year and several larger brands that drove excellent comps and we believe will continue to attract new customers and gain market share. Together these should drive nicely positive Retail segment comps in FY25. In addition, we possess the opportunity to further improve merchandise margins while holding the line on ‘SG&A’ increases. This bodes well for profitability, so we remain encouraged that FY25 could produce solid growth in sales and profits. We are, of course, acutely aware that our single largest opportunity to improve the bottom-line rests with our ability to turn the Urban brand around. To that end, and as Sheila discussed, we are highly focused on building the team, improving the product offering, and strengthening our marketing efforts. We have made significant progress in our search for a brand President which is a critical step in moving forward. Looking further into the future, I believe we are witnessing the beginning of another watershed period in retail, much like the impact e-commerce had beginning in the early 2000s, and mobile commerce had the following decade. Current advances in machine learning technology hold the promise to transform the business of retail once again. Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to deliver much shorter product lead times, more accurate demand forecasts, better allocations, more personalized marketing, and optimized inventory planning, among many other benefits. These technologies should improve efficiency, reduce waste, and provide cost savings across a wide range of functions. Our brand teams and I are especially excited by the potential for generative AI to augment and enhance our already superb creative capabilities. We expect to give you an annual update and appraisal of our progress in realizing the benefits of these amazing new tools. In closing, I thank our brand and shared service leaders and their merchant, creative and operating teams and our 24,000 associates worldwide. Their efforts produced another outstanding quarter, and I thank them. I am constantly humbled by their remarkable dedication and creativity. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the globe. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I now turn the call over for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: How much of a headwind does the Urban Outfitters weakness pose to your fourth quarter gross margin? And then separately, how are you planning receipts for that brand for the first half of next year?\nFrank Conforti: Hi, Lorraine. I can take the first half of your question. The UO headwind is baked into our forecast. So it is contemplated in our plan, being able to achieve over 300 basis points of gross profit margin improvement in the fourth quarter. I also just want to point out in that plan, that is off of sort of what I would call an adjusted Q4. It does not include the $5.4 million of impairment that was in the fourth quarter of last year. If you were to include that impairment, our gross profit margin improvement could likely come in over 340 basis points of improvement. But we normally just adjust that out. And then, as it relates to inventory, I think Sheila can take that.\nSheila Harrington: I can take that. Hi, Lorraine. As we believe that the business can improve in small amounts quarter-over-quarter, we want to make sure that we manage our inventory accordingly and that we don’t basically be too aggressive one way or the other. We feel like as we move throughout the first half of the year, we will start to see sales outpace inventory level. We want to make sure that we give the stores a compelling assortment to walk into. And so, we definitely feel like it’s going to be an ease versus an immediate reaction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: On the positive reaction to assortments and marketing that you cited into holiday deck, could you just elaborate on recent trends you’ve seen in November across banners? Maybe any key color by category that you’re anticipating in holiday? And then Melanie, could you just speak to gross margin drivers in the fourth quarter? And just any opportunity remaining as we move into FY25 on the gross margin front?\nRichard Hayne: Sure. I’d be pleased to do that, Matt. Retail segment comp performance so far in Q4 are very similar to our results in October. As Melanie discussed, the October results were slightly -- and again, I want to emphasize that were ‘slightly’ below Q3 total results. The biggest difference has been Free People, which is now posting comps in the high teens rather than the stratospheric mid-20s that they achieved in Q3. Meanwhile, the Urban brand in North America is seeing some comp improvement to date, but it’s still negative. If you wrap that all together, we believe total URBN Q4 Retail segment comps should come in at approximately 3%.\nFrank Conforti: And then, Matt, as it relates to gross profit margin, I think the over 300 basis points of improvement in the fourth quarter is largely going to be driven by IMU improvements. And that’s really across all of our brands as we’re really starting to realize the normalization of inbound supply chain costs as well as just the benefit of all the several cross-functional initiatives that we’re seeing across the entire enterprise. As we look forward into fiscal ‘25, we do think that there is room for continued gross profit margin expansion. Again, I think part of that would be driven by improved IMU across all banners. We obviously still will be reaping the benefits of the inbound transportation costs coming down, but also -- and more importantly, the incremental benefits continuing of the cross-functional initiatives that we’ve led on with. And then secondarily, I think we do think that we’ll start to see some improvement potentially from a markdown rate perspective, largely being driven by the Urban Outfitters brand. And then lastly, we think we can start to see a little bit of improvement and benefits of the new distribution facility that we built in Kansas that is now up and running. And as that begins to -- starts to reach its sort of full allocation. We’ll start to see those benefits in not just logistics, but in delivery expense moderate throughout the year and then hopefully build on those to have continued benefits in the following year as well. So, I think there’s IMU opportunity across all three brands. There’s a healthy amount of markdown opportunity at the Urban Outfitters brand. And I think you could start to see the logistics and delivery expense opportunity due to that new facility in Kansas, all leading to some nice opportunity in fiscal ‘25.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.\nPaul Lejuez: Dick, I’m curious how you view the potential turnaround at Urban Outfitters in the context of just where fashion trends are? Do you think performance there is about not interpreting the fashion correctly? Or is this something more structural in terms of store size, number and number of store locations or say, number and locations of stores. the competitive set, just how you’re thinking about the turn there? And then separately, you talked about machine learning and efficiency tools. Is there a big cost that is tied to that coming up in the future for you guys, or is that something you already have at our fingertips? Just curious what that looks like. Thanks.\nRichard Hayne: I’ll start with the second part first, Paul. Certainly, we don’t have AI and machine learning at our fingertips. It is something that we will invest in over time, and we will make steady progress. As I said, it’s very much like some of the other initiatives that happened like e-commerce in the early ‘90s. We didn’t jump into that full throttle from 1990. We started it. We got some feedback. We find out what worked, what didn’t work, invested a little bit more. And I think we’re fairly ahead of the curve then, and we expect to be somewhere near the beginning of the curve in this endeavor as well. As it relates to turning the Urban brand around, I think Sheila gave a fairly comprehensive dissertation about how we plan to do that. The one thing that you didn’t talk about that I do want to emphasize is that we think hiring a President for Urban Outfitters is a key component. And we’ve made significant progress in -- toward that end. And I think you might hear something in the next few months. So, that will be one thing. And then we have to improve our product offering, and we have to improve, most importantly, our marketing. I think the product offering I think that what you’ve seen is a shift in fashion to a more feminine look. And that feminine look is performing quite well. And we will increase the penetration of femininity in our assortment. This is not -- while we’ve always had feminine, this is not something that Urban Outfitters is particularly known for. It’s not like the Free People or Anthropologie brands, which are much more highly feminine. And so I think in that sense, we’re swinging a little against the side, but I don’t want to put that out there as an excuse. Our job is to always have the products that our customers want. I think in terms of the marketing, I think that that is -- as Sheila said, is and was a miss and that we didn’t move along with the customer and appear where the customer was residing in areas like TikTok and we didn’t quickly enough adopt YouTube as one of our main platforms. We did have an awful large exposure on Instagram and remain on that platform. So, I think as we move along and have better marketing and show up where the customer is, we will continue our march toward a greater penetration of digital customers and improve our sessions. So I think that does it. So ask for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.\nAlex Straton: I wanted to focus on the Urban banner as well. Thanks a lot for the color on the initiatives. With those in place, how do you think about the time line for the Urban Outfitters inflection from here and what are the key metrics you’re watching in the meantime? And then secondly, just on profitability for that business. I’m having trouble thinking about where it sits versus history and how much of a drag it is on the total business. So perhaps if you could just kind of outline the puts and takes on that piece, too, it would be super helpful. Thanks a lot.\nSheila Harrington: Okay. Alex, I’m going to take the first part of that question. I think when we think about how long it will take to turn the Urban Outfitters brand and how we’re thinking about how we’re measuring that. I think we want to do it in a very healthy way and look for improvement month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter because we’ve lost our consumer, we’re staying highly focused on the 18- to 25-year-old Urban Outfitters consumer. And we feel like with laser focus on the consumer we will gain that customer back. We are hyper focused on the new consumer. We’ve lost our way. We need to get that consumer back. And through our marketing efforts, whether it’s engagement in the different social platforms, we’re looking for that. We’re listening hard to the consumer there as well as watching what they’re reacting to in terms of product offering. So I think not only from a top line sales perspective or a sales velocity as we look at from a merchant, but also trying to listen much harder to what we do and where it resonates the most. So quarter-over-quarter improvement is what we’re looking for, for a long-term, healthy return for Urban Outfitters growth.\nRichard Hayne: And Alex, this is Dick talking. I think that you asked about metrics. I know that Sheila is always watching, and watching extremely carefully the number of sessions on a daily basis and store traffic. And I think those two metrics, if we can see those in true, we will know that we are on the right track, and sales will follow. Frank, do you want to take the last part of the question?\nFrank Conforti: Sure. Obviously, the UO profitability has fallen pretty meaningfully from where they’ve historically run at. I think the nice thing is with the strength of our other four businesses, we’ve been able to more than compensate for that and drive really, really healthy operating profit gains. And then that leaves for the opportunity for as Urban does begin to turn their business around for them to then contribute to incremental growth in fiscal ‘25 and beyond and begin to recapture from where they were.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.\nDana Telsey: As you think about the strength of some of the smaller businesses like Free People Movement and now Nuuly with reaching profitability earlier, what do you think the opportunity for them is, and just early thinking about framing 2024 and the incremental improvement potentially to gross or operating margins from those businesses? And lastly, just on the gross margin discussion of the higher IMU and lower markdowns, is there opportunity to continue this going forward in this environment, or is there any changes that you see in the structure of IMU or markdown cadence? Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. Dana, I’ll take the first part of that question and then pass it along both to Sheila, who will talk about Free People Movement and to Dave, who will talk about Nuuly. I’m glad you asked the question because we collectively here at URBN are extremely excited about what you’ve called the smaller businesses because we think they won’t be smaller for that long. We think both Nuuly and Free People Movement have an opportunity to be $1 billion plus brands. And I can’t tell you that’s going to happen in FY25 because I know it won’t. But I think it is going to happen much quicker than any of our other brands reached $1 billion. And so, Sheila, would you like to talk about Movement?\nSheila Harrington: Sure. I’ll start. Yes, we’re excited about FP Movement. The metrics that we’re reading just indicate that we should invest with as much speed as we possibly can, which Dick has been encouraging us to do all along. And with this speed comes scale, in that scale, it comes IMU. So I do think as we continue to grow the FP Movement brand with nearly doubling our store count with at least 25 new stores next year and a robust digital and marketing strategy attached to attracting new customers. So, there is only upside in terms of IMU from the depth of our buys frankly. And there’s a lot of strategies that have been in long work to be able to take advantage of that scale, Dana.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. Dave, do you want to take Nuuly?\nDave Hayne: Yes, sure. Dana, thanks for the question. We’ve been having a lot of fun building the Nuuly business. We see a lot of opportunity with the Nuuly business to continue to grow. It’s been really interesting to learn a new business, and there’s been a lot of interesting learnings from it. I think one of the most interesting learnings that we’ve seen is that we’re really growing a new market. We don’t see ourselves necessarily always stealing share in the Nuuly business. We feel like we’re growing a new market and rental is a new concept that people have to learn. The indicator that kind of gives us that impression is that when we see -- we survey all of our new subscribers and when we see new subscribers join Nuuly, roughly 60% of them have never rented from anybody before. So, it really feels like we’re bringing new customers into a new consumption model, which just gives us a lot of excitement for the future and where this can go as more and more people come upon the idea of renting. So, I think that’s a really exciting thing. And then I think also as we continue to scale on the infrastructure that’s going to be supporting Nuuly, opening our next warehouse in Raymore, Missouri should allow us to really drive down a fair amount of our variable costs across our delivery and shipping costs. So, those types of things are just going to allow us to continue to leverage as we continue to grow. So, fun times at Nuuly.\nFrank Conforti: I think, Dana -- this is Frank. What’s really exciting is when you think about our goal of getting to the 10% operating profit. And obviously, we, knock on wood, have made some really nice progress in the first three quarters this year, and I think we’re going to continue to make progress towards that goal in the fourth quarter and rounding out fiscal ‘24. Then you start to think about the levers that can get us there that we can pull on. We do talk about improved IMU across all three brands. There is nothing structurally that we believe that we’re done yet in driving IMU improvement. We talk about Nuuly, reaching their milestone of hitting operating profit and being able to build upon that into fiscal ‘25 and going forward. We talk about FP Movement, which is producing 55% growth just now in the third quarter and a double-digit operating profit rate, right? So they’re going to continue to have outpaced growth versus some of our other businesses and meaningfully contribute to our operating profit growth. As we talked about, Urban Outfitters, currently not running where they historically have. But, as that business begins to turn around contributing into our operating profit growth next year as well, there’s really just a lot of opportunity across the table for us to build upon the progress that we’ve made this year and hit that 10% operating profit goal and continue to run there on a longer term basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research Associates.\nJanet Kloppenburg: Dick, when you think about Free People Movement and its success, Dick and Sheila. Do you think that we should anticipate an acceleration of store openings for that brand, while the Free People store openings continue? And should we think that that’s an opportunity for unit expansion to accelerate as we look forward? And then just on the recent sales slowdown, could you -- and I know it’s slight, Dick, I’m not hysterical. So I just wanted to understand if it was attributable to sort of warmer weather in many markets or any sort of geographical or category dispersions that you’re seeing?\nRichard Hayne: Okay, Janet. I’m going to ask Sheila talk about first because I know she’s really excited about Free People Movement and is planning to open a lot of new stores. Sheila?\nSheila Harrington: Yes. So Janet, we have a strong pipeline currently ready to go for next year. So 25, we are saying at least 25. I think that’s the most amount of stores, at least in my growth of the Free People brand family that we’ve experienced. So I would say that we see that growth, knock on wood, continuing for several years to come, frankly, as we explore new markets. We’re actually in a couple of markets that Free People is not in with FP Movement as well. And this isn’t at the cost of the growth of Free People. As I spoke about, we have a lot of growth internationally and digitally still to do with the Free People brand itself. So, we see both brands growing independently, obviously, FP Movement at an accelerated level towards our $1 billion goal. As far as the slowdown of Free People, Q3 ended the 14th quarter of sequential positive FP, Retail segment growth, 27 if we exclude that one quarter a couple of years ago in fiscal ‘21. So we’re just up against more challenging positive comparisons. And frankly, I feel extremely strong that the buying teams, the design teams and our marketing teams are all in the pulse of the right fashion trends. And so, we remain extremely optimistic and positive going into the fourth quarter. I think this time of year is always -- want to pause on, but we’re seeing very strong results to date, and we have no reason to believe our momentum is going to be interrupted.\nFrank Conforti: Janet, I just want to add in real quick on the FP Movement stores. Honestly, some really impressive stats. When you think about the fact that it’s still a very young brand that’s growing in an awareness, and the fact that their sales and profit productivity is on par with the Free People brand in such early days to have that strength and success in those doors really leaves us very confident and excited about that store growth. And that’s why -- Sheila talked about 25 at least, if not more, just because we’ve been really impressed over the first couple of years at how well those stores have performed, especially given the continued awareness that we’re starting to build upon, but obviously, much less than where the Free People collection brand stands.\nRichard Hayne: And Janet, I can tell you, we all sit around and talk a good deal about what you -- what we have discussed as a slight, and again, slight slowdown in October. And we threw out there some potential reasons like the weather, like the war, like the student loan repayment and like a harder comparisons. And I think we’ve just kind of said that we don’t think necessarily there are any of them. Of course, the heavier -- the harder comparisons are real. And so, that’s got to be a factor. Student loans, how could that possibly be positive? It only could steal money away from purchasing. So, that could be a factor. Quite frankly, we just can’t come up with one that we feel is so compelling that we can attribute this slight slowdown to it. What I will tell you is that we’re very convinced given the behavior of the customer that what it isn’t, is the beginning of the dreaded R word. We don’t think there’s any sense that we can see in our business of the consumer pulling back. She’s very engaged with the brand, she’s buying full price and she’s buying fashion. And those are very unusual in my experience, if it were to beginning of recession. So I don’t think that we should fret about that. I think our business is very healthy. The customer is healthy. And we believe that we’re going to have an excellent holiday season.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker?\nMarni Shapiro: Thank you for taking my call under the wire. And so I don’t forget, happy Black Friday to everybody. Dave, I have a question for you on Nuuly. Congratulations on turning to profitability, and starting a new business is very difficult. And one of the most expensive parts of that is the customer acquisition cost. So I’m curious if we can dig into that just a little bit. Have they come down at all? Are they high or low relative to the industry? And are you able to tap into or draft off of really, I guess, Free People and Anthro to bring customers into Nuuly just a little what that looks like?\nDave Hayne: Yes. Sure, Marni. Thanks for the question, and thanks for all the kind words. Our customer acquisition costs have been -- over the last few years, actually have been a lot less than what we originally thought they were going to be when we originally started the business. So, we’ve been very happy about that. I think our team has been very creative about how they go about marketing. They’ve been leveraging a lot of part of mouth, which has been something that’s been a huge driver for the business, putting in place things like referral programs that allow people to incentivize that word of mouth has been a big driver for us. We do spend across some social platforms. And in those platforms, we are spending creatively across things like ambassador programs and influencer programs, so I would say that we’ve been very happy with what our customer acquisition costs look like. I think there’s an opportunity to continue to draft off what we’ve been -- a lot of the good work we’ve been doing. We do -- we don’t draft off the other brands like you were suggesting really at all from a marketing standpoint. What I would say is we draft off the other brands very much from a product standpoint, and that’s a huge benefit of the platform. We have the luxury of working with some sister brands that produce amazing product that customers would love to rent and do love to rent. So I think that is a huge customer acquisition source that we have that is a big benefit for us. The fact that Anthropologie and Free People and Free-est product is on our platform, it’s just something that is also an attractive thing that brings in new customers. So I think all of that combined has been one of the big reasons for the success so far.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. I think that wraps up today’s call. I thank you all very much for joining I wish you all of the most joyous Thanksgiving. Don’t overeat because Black Friday’s the next day, and we all have to be out in stores. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Urban Outfitters, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce on Oona McCullough, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nOona McCullough: Good afternoon, and welcome to the URBN second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. Earlier this afternoon, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three and six month period ending July 31, 2023. The following discussions may include forward-looking statements. Please note that actual results may differ materially from those statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On today's call, you will hear from Richard Hayne, Chief Executive Officer, URBN; Tricia Smith, Global CEO, Anthropologie Group; Frank Conforti, Co-President and COO, URBN; and Melanie Marein-Efron, Chief Financial Officer, URBN. Following that, we will be pleased to address your questions. For more detailed commentary on our quarterly performance and the text of today's conference call, please refer to our Investor Relations website at www.urbn.com. I will now turn the call over to Dick.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with some brief remarks regarding our second quarter results, and then make a few observations concerning our view of the customer and the macro environment. After that, I'll turn the call over to Tricia Smith, who will provide greater detail about Anthropologie's stellar second quarter results. Then, Frank and Melanie will add to the analysis of our Q2 results, along with thoughts about our future business. Simply put, URBN's Q2 results were outstanding. In total, they topped our optimistic expectations. Four of our five brands posted record second quarter revenues. The Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands produced double-digit sales growth in stores and online, with FP Movement leading the way with comp sales of plus 57%. This more than offset a negative comp at the Urban Outfitters brand. Total URBN delivered 8% revenue growth, while the total Retail segment comp sales increased by 5%. The Nuuly brand, our apparel rental service, continue to enjoy strong positive response through its business concept and product offering with year-over-year revenues almost doubling in Q2, driven by an 85% increase in active subscribers. Nuuly contributed $27 million in additional revenues versus last year's second quarter. Total Wholesale segment revenues declined by 5% as some of our larger partners continue to write smaller orders as they seek to operate with leaner inventory levels and grow their penetration of internally generated product. Customer demand for fashion at the Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands remained strong throughout Q2. The customer continued to respond positively to fashion newness and within women's apparel, accessories and shoe categories. Effective brand marketing drove robust traffic increases to our website and stores, including strong growth in new customers. Clearly, these brands were pleasing existing customers and capturing additional market share. So far in August, total Retail segment comps are in line with first half results, and we believe total Retail segment comps in Q3 could look very similar to both previous quarters. During the July and August back-to-school period, the Urban Outfitters team in North America succeeded in improving women's and men's apparel comps, especially in stores. But unfortunately, the comp improvement fell short of our goals. In Q2, the apparel teams also improved full-price sales, lowered markdown rates and enhanced the IMU and MMU, but total brand comp sales remained disappointingly weak. We've made some progress, but the teams know there is still much work to be done to write the Urban ship. That work is underway, but could take longer than we originally expected. Let me now focus your attention on URBN's bottom line results. In Q2, we enjoyed the continued benefit of our pre-COVID like operating environment. Supply chain speed and reliability returned to pre-COVID levels. A speedier supply chain allowed the merchants to keep inventories tight, thus lowering markdowns. At the same time, our IMU improvement initiatives, especially the reduction in inbound freight costs, exceeded expectations. Combining better IMU with lower markdown rates resulted in a 400-plus basis point improvement in gross margins and led to the Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands posting very strong second quarter operating results. Total URBN operating income soared 54% versus the prior year to $132 million and earnings jumped 72% to $1.10 per share. All indicators currently point to a combination of the robust business we've seen in the first half. Our customer is favoring fashion over price, and she is responding nicely to our brand concepts, our assortment and our marketing. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tricia to discuss Anthropologie's second quarter. Tricia?\nTricia Smith: Thank you, Dick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to speak to you today about the Anthropologie Group's strong second quarter performance and our ongoing strategic growth initiatives. First, I'll start with the quarter. The Anthropologie Group delivered an 11% Retail segment comp, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of positive sales comps. The quarter's comps were driven by double-digit growth in both stores and digital. We exceeded pre-pandemic traffic, conversion and comps in stores and online. By product category, the team delivered exceptional growth in the apparel, accessories and shoe categories, delivering sales comps over 20%. Our top line performance was accompanied by an even more impressive growth in profit, driven by significant improvement in IMU and continued reductions in markdowns versus last year. This year, the brand is running significantly fewer promotional days than we have in the past, allowing us to deliver an impressive 22% growth in our regular price business and a 30% year-over-year increase in operating income. The strength across all apparel and accessory categories has continued in the month of August, which has us optimistic that Anthropologie can continue to drive strong comps in the third quarter. Our outstanding second quarter performance reflects the strategy we developed 2.5 years ago when I arrived at the brand. At that time, sales growth had slowed, particularly in apparel and accessories, and the brand had become too dependent on promotional activity. We knew we had an opportunity to attract more new and younger customers to the brand and offer them a wider range of products, enabling us to gain market share. The first course of action was aligning and empowering our leadership team around our strategy and goals to best serve our customers. Next, the team set four strategic priorities to recapture market share. These four priorities are modernize our product, enhance our selling environments both in stores and online, provide inspirational creative content, and grow our customer base across multiple age demographics. First, modernizing our product. It was essential that we developed the right mix of owned brand fashion, customer favorites and premium brands to help us return to full-price growth and offer more fashion forward product. Our focus has been to distort into core categories such as dresses and denim, introduce new concepts that appeal to different end uses such as an assortment that satisfies for vacation and casual needs, and elevate the edit of market brands to modernize the assortment to appeal to a younger customer. We began by improving and expanding the own brand assortment, concentrated on our Pilcro, Maeve and By Anthropologie labels. Today, our own brand product mix up over 60% of the apparel assortment. We have elevated our market brand assortment with the selection of premium brands that are aspirational for the younger customer such as Reformation, Favorite Daughter, Good American and On Running, and we are becoming a go-to destination for these premium brands. Additionally, we expanded apparel adjacent categories such as intimates, accessories and shoes to cater to the different end uses of our customer's life we were not fully servicing. Moving on to the second and third priorities of enhancing our selling environments and creating inspirational creative content with the goal of becoming an aspirational brand for new and existing customers. We knew the customer wanted to be inspired by complete look through digitally-enabled experiences and in-store styling. As the product teams distorted into key categories and pushed new fashion trends, the creative teams elevated the imagery and enhanced the store visual experience to properly support the brand message with an omni experience in mind. Today, our teams create some of the most aspirational imagery in our industry. We have invested in creating exceptional omni-channel experiences, and this has translated into the strong traffic and comp sales the brand is experiencing today. Our last priority was to grow our customer base. We wanted to introduce the brand to a new generation of customers while strengthening our relationship with our existing customer. We have invested in marketing to drive customer acquisition, conversion and retention. In North America, during the second quarter, new customer growth surpassed 10%, while active customer spend increased high-single digits. We designed New to Next marketing strategies that drive repeat purchases by new customers. In the past year, over 30% of new customers have returned to the brand to make a second purchase. Over 60% of the women's new customer growth enter via our enhanced own brand product available only at Anthropologie. These customers are 2.5 years younger than our existing core customer. I'll shift gears now to touch on our home performance. Much of today's call has centered on the opportunities the brand has in apparel and accessories. When I entered the business, these categories had the most opportunity to reignite growth, while Home had just delivered multiple years of outsized growth. Although Home was slightly negative this quarter, we see customers pivot from pandemic-driven furniture purchases to more hosting and entertaining focused categories. Customers are improving their homes with decorative layers, focusing on tabletop, glassware, decorative objects and textiles. As they refresh their spaces and prepare to entertain more, we have seen robust growth within our regular price business and gift and entertaining categories. We have hired a new President of our Anthropologie Home and we'll be deploying strategic priorities to drive outsized growth and brand awareness in our Home business. I'm confident in our growth opportunities and the team's ability to execute and look forward to sharing more on upcoming calls. In conclusion, the team's focus on our four priorities has transformed our business. Looking forward, our strategy is consistent with the work we've done to get here, and our focus remains on top line growth and bottom line expansion. We have plans to increase our apparel and accessories business to $2 billion, while building a foundation to double our Home business to $1 billion and will be strategically increasing our global store count to 270 over the next several years. We look forward to providing you with more updates in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Conforti: Thank you, Tricia, and congratulations to you and the team on a truly outstanding quarter. We are excited to support the brand's continued growth and help the team reach their goals. Now, I will discuss you URBN's total company results and then give some additional details on our brands. As Dick noted, the second quarter for URBN performed nicely ahead of our expectations from when we spoke on the May conference call. Total company sales grew by 8% to a second quarter record of $1.3 billion, driven by a total Retail segment comp increase of 5% and a Nuuly segment revenue increase of $27 million. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decline in the Wholesale segment. The growth in Retail segment comp sales was driven by a positive mid-single-digit comp in both the digital and store channels. Nuuly's robust increase in revenue was due to a significant increase in subscribers from the prior year. The Wholesale segment sales decline was due to a decrease at the Free People brand. Now moving on to gross profit. Gross profit dollars increased by 22%, while gross profit rate improved by 416 basis points. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily due to significantly improved initial margins and lower markdown rates at all brands. Improved initial margins in the quarter were driven by lower inbound freight costs as well as the early benefits on several of our URBN cross-functional initiatives. As Melanie will discuss in more detail, we believe we can continue to drive improved IMU as well as lower markdown rates for the remainder of the year. I cannot thank the teams enough for their continued focus and results in driving improved IMU and lower markdown rates. Next, I want to briefly touch on inventory. Total inventory was down 16%, with Retail segment comp inventory down 2% and Wholesale segment inventory down 32%. We have remained committed to managing inventory variances below our sales growth rates and we are delivering on our commitments. We believe our improved inventory to sales ratio is one of the primary drivers of our lower markdown rates. As a result of our Q2 record sales as well as significant improvement in gross margin, our operating profit increased 54% from the previous year to $132 million, with earnings per share increasing by 72% to $1.10 per share. Earnings per share growth was primarily driven by healthy operating profit growth and additionally benefited from a lower effective tax rate versus last year. Since Tricia has already provided an update on the Anthropologie, I will now provide more details for the remaining brands, starting with the Free People Group. This quarter, Free People delivered historically exceptional results, once again achieving record sales and profits in the second quarter. Retail segment comps at the Free People Group accelerated from the first quarter and finished the quarter at a robust 27% Retail segment comp increase. Within the group, the Free People brand produced a strong 22% comp and FP Movement brand produced an impressive 57% comp. Total Retail segment comp was driven by double-digit comps in the store and digital channels. These double-digit comps were driven by strong traffic growth in both channels, due in part to excellent marketing execution as well as average unit retail growth fueled by increased full-price selling across all major product categories. Total customer growth also reached double-digit increases for the quarter for both the Free People and FP Movement brands. The Free People Group's improvement in sales was only outdone by their impressive surge in profitability for the quarter. The strength of the Free People Group's assortments, marketing campaigns and store experience have continued into the early fall. We believe the Free People Group's Retail segment performance will continue to be nicely positive in the third quarter. Free People wholesale segment sales decreased 17% during the second quarter. The decrease in sales was the result of weakness in department store accounts partially offset by growth in specialty store accounts. Although wholesale sales remain challenged, profitability has returned to a healthy level. We believe Wholesale segment sales could decline for the remainder of the year due to continued focus on the right balance of account partners and doors for the brand, while the rate of profit could remain in a healthy low-double-digit range. Now moving on to Urban Outfitters. Urban recorded a negative 14% Retail segment comp in Q2. UO's negative comp was the result of disappointing performance in North America and a slightly negative comp in Europe. In North America, comp store sales were high-single-digit negative, while the digital channel comp sales were double-digit negative. In Europe, the weakness was concentrated in the UK, while the rest of Europe continued to see positive Retail segment comps. As Dick noted earlier, we did see improvement in North America's women's and men's apparel in the back-to-school season versus last year, but we still know we can execute better and we will need more time to drive the overall improvement we want. Next, I will touch on the Nuuly business. The brand continued to deliver strong year-over-year subscriber growth with active subs increasing 84% to last year. We continue to believe active subs could approach or possibly exceed 200,000 by year-end. In addition to strong revenue numbers, Nuuly continues to make fast and steady strides towards profitability and we continue to believe Nuuly will record its first profitable quarter later this year. Lastly, I want to congratulate the teams on the opening of our new state-of-the art distribution and fulfillment facility in Kansas City, Kansas. We believe this facility will improve our overall operating efficiency, reduce our average cost of consumer delivery expense as well as increase our delivery speed to our customers. I will now turn the call to Melanie Marein-Efron, our Chief Financial Officer.\nMelanie Marein-Efron: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. Now, I will discuss our thoughts on the third quarter and fiscal year '24 financial performance. We are pleased that overall consumer demand has remained strong to start the quarter and we're planning for this strength to continue throughout the third quarter. Right now, we believe third quarter total company sales growth could be in the high-single digits. Sales growth in Q3 could result from mid-single-digit growth in Retail segment comp sales and high-double-digit growth of Nuuly segment sales versus last year. Our growth in the Retail and Nuuly segments is likely to be partially offset by a sales decline in our Wholesale segment. Now on to gross profit margin. We believe URBN's gross margin rate for the third quarter could improve by more than 400 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter, similar to the improvement which we realized in Q2. The increase in gross profit margin could be driven by higher initial product margins from lower inbound freight cost as well as lower merchandise markdowns. An improved supply chain is allowing us to bring in product closer to demand. As a result of well-controlled inventory and a healthier supply chain, we believe that there could be lower markdowns in the third quarter compared to prior year third quarter. Now, moving on to SG&A expenses. Based on our current sales performance and plan, we believe SG&A growth for the third quarter will increase in the low-double digits. Our planned growth in SG&A could be primarily driven by higher overall payroll due to anticipated higher incentive pay from improved company performance, lower vacancy rates and higher payroll rates. In addition, we intend to increase marketing expense to drive incremental customer growth at Free People and Anthropologie. This could result in SG&A rate deleverage versus last year. As always, if sales performance fluctuates, we maintain a certain level of variable SG&A spending that we can adjust up and down depending on how our business is performing. While we believe SG&A growth could outpace sales growth in Q3, we also believe that SG&A expense growth in the fourth quarter will be more closely aligned with sales growth. We are currently planning our effective tax rate to be approximately 25% for the third quarter and full year. Now moving on to inventory. We have made significant progress this year controlling our inventory to sales ratio. We believe that inventory levels in the third quarter could grow at a rate below sales growth. The team continues to make progress speeding up inventory turns and are targeting product turns close to pre-pandemic levels at most of our brands by the end of fiscal year '24. Capital expenditures for the fiscal year are planned at approximately $230 million. The spend is primarily related to investments in additional distribution facilities. Earlier this month, we opened our highly-automated omni fulfillment facility in Kansas City, Kansas. In addition, we are investing in a new rental fulfillment facility in Missouri within the Kansas City region. We are targeting to open this facility at the beginning of fiscal year '25. Lastly, we'll be opening approximately 28 new stores and closing approximately 21 stores during fiscal year '24. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Dick.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you, Mel. In conclusion, as you've heard from Mel and Frank, we're confident about our prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We have four brands that are executing at rarefied levels and gaining market share. In addition to top line growth, we have significant margin recapture as demonstrated by our performance in the first two quarters. All this would not be possible without the hard work of our brand and shared service leaders, their merchant, creative and operating teams, and our 24,000 associates worldwide. With their amazing dedication and creativity, they produced a truly outstanding quarter, and I thank them. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. Finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I turn the call over for your questions, I remind you to please keep your questions to one per caller, so we have time to recognize more of your colleagues. Thank you, and now for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could just elaborate on your comments about the Urban Outfitters brand, turn kicking longer than expected. And then with that, talk to your comfort with the level of incoming receipts at the brand for the remainder of the year. Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Sheila, would you like to take that?\nSheila Harrington: Sure. I think at the last call we talked about apparel being the focus and it certainly was both the men's and women's apparel assortment has progressively got better throughout the quarter. And in August, we are sitting at a positive comp in our store with stronger MMU. And what's taking a little longer is, now what we did in apparel, it needs to be done to the accessories, shoe and home business. And then we need to get our DTC business rightsized. It's been heavily reliant on promotional activity, and we don't think this is a long-term strategy that the brand needs to progress forward. So that is what I'm referring to as the long-term opportunity to change the trajectory of the brand to health profile (ph). And I believe our inventory levels are with the speed model that we've been allowed to get back to you in apparel, we'll be able to hold the same rules of engagement that URBN is that sales should outpace inventory comps.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAdrienne Yih: Good afternoon. Congratulations. It's great to see all three brands kind of in various phases of repairs, and even UO. I guess my question is...\nRichard Hayne: Thank you, Adrienne.\nAdrienne Yih: You're welcome. It's on the merchandise margin cycles. So within each of those three brands, I'm wondering, maybe Frank or Melanie, if you can remind us sort of where each of the brand is in their kind of promotional cycle relative to normal. So for example, Anthropologie, while very clean, are they still at above average and still room to grow? And then, for example, like under -- Urban Outfitters, are they at new lows and so should we think about kind of low-hanging fruit in terms of their merchandise margin capture? Thank you very much.\nFrank Conforti: Adrienne, I can take a stab at that and then certainly, Tricia, and Sheila can correct me and add any more color, if they want. I think all of the brands, which is great to see, are driving healthy improvement in IMU and markdown rate. The IMU improvement across all brands is fairly consistent and is -- I want to say not quite at fiscal -- pre-pandemic levels, but certainly is approaching there. And you're seeing that benefit driven not just by lower inbound freight expenses now as those expenses have normalized. You're honestly starting to see several of our URBN cross-functional initiatives really start to take hold, and that's just that a credit to the sourcing teams and the brand for their execution there. We still believe that goal that we set almost two years ago of 500 basis points of improvement in IMU versus Q4 of fiscal '22, we will be able to achieve next year and we think we're actually going be pretty darn close when we get to Q4 of this year. Again, all of the brands on the markdown side as well are favorable on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, you've got the really strong sales performance at Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands, as well as better inventory control as the supply chain has improved across all three brands, which is benefiting the businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey. Thanks, guys. Can I just go back to the answer to Lorraine's question? I think you said something was running positive August to date. Were you talking about the Urban Outfitters brand specifically? Or are you referring to overall URBN? And then my question is, you had, I think, 21 closed stores to date. Curious what you're thinking about future store closing, specifically at Urban, and how that might break down between urban locations, meaning city locations, versus suburban or lifestyle versus mall? Thanks.\nSheila Harrington: I'll clarify the first part of the question around Urban Outfitters. Urban women's and men's apparel brands are sitting positive within our store businesses month to date. And this is a continuation of the improvement that we saw throughout Q2. And we still have a great deal of improvement to do within our accessories and home and shoe businesses. Accessories, we anticipate this turn happening in Q4, where home might take a little bit longer.\nRichard Hayne: Paul, and about the store closure and specifically with Urban, but it actually applies to all three brands. When stores come up for renewal, we look at them very closely and try to ascertain if we have an opportunity to make money at those stores over the next five years, that's typical renewal date. And if we do, then we sign up for them. If we don't, then we pass. And I think it's that simple. And your comment about city or non-city locations. A number of cities, as you might imagine, it's been a little bit more difficult in the last few years to make money. So we are closing more city locations than we are at mall locations, but -- on a percent basis. But we treat them equally. Some of the city locations are still doing quite well, and we won't close them. So I think that's basically how we look at it.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAlex Straton: Great. Congrats on a nice quarter, and thanks for taking my question. Just two from me. One is on Anthropologie and Free People. I'm just wondering how you think about the sustainability of the top line strength there. I think you said both continued at 2Q levels into the third quarter, so just wanted to confirm that. And then secondly, just on gross margin. I'm curious if you could outline kind of the levers or puts and takes there as you thought through the back half guide. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. I'm going to ask Tricia to talk about how she looks at sustainability of our results in Anthropologie.\nTricia Smith: Hey, Alex. We have a really incredible team that's really passionate about serving our customers, one of the best that I've worked with across the course of our (ph) career. And I think as we continue to introduce more customers to our brands, we're really focused on ensuring that they come back to shop with us with our new to next strategy. And we've been really consistently acquiring customers over the past two years and are confident in our strategy to continue that growth. So our teams stay incredibly close to our customers, they're very good at identifying new opportunities and we'll continue to leverage the strategic priorities that have contributed to the growth that we've had over the last couple of years and feel confident that we'll be able to continue that.\nRichard Hayne: Great. And gross margin, Frank?\nFrank Conforti: Yes, I can talk to gross profit margin and then maybe Sheila will talk about the confidence on Free People side. So as it relates to the leverage for the back half of the year, I think I'll start with IMU with which we've seen nice gains in the first half and we would basically anticipate to see very similar gains in the back half of the year, again that's being driven by lower inbound freight expenses as well as several of our URBN cross-functional initiatives. With a lot of our orders on and that trend in place, I think we feel pretty confident about the IMU improvement on the back half of the year. And then secondarily is the markdown rate improvement. And I think as Tricia and I know Sheila will speak to, the strength of the business at Anthropologie and Free People, that leaves us with, I think, a pretty high level of confidence that we'll see markdown rate improvement over the back half of the year at those brands as well as then contributing to lower inventory, better-positioned inventory and better inventory control across all brands. With the supply chain improving, I think that gives us confidence for markdown rate improvement as well across all brands. Sheila?\nSheila Harrington: Thanks. On Free People, we have continued to grow and similar to Anthropologie have been able to retain our core customer and add new customers. And so I feel pretty confident that the brand is going to be able to continue to gain market share. It has an initiative to gain market share within the denim and fashion-structured bottom business, which I think we're executing to at an accelerated level currently. And then we -- I would be remiss not to mention FP Movement as part of the total Free People brand lifestyle. This is at early stages of the growth, but robustly comping and we've laid out our $1 billion marker for go forward.\nRichard Hayne: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you.\nMatthew Boss: So, Dick, on the continued sales momentum in August, any notable categories or areas of the product assortment to really call out, maybe between occasion wear and casual where we stand with those two curves? And then just given the number of moving parts, is there any way you could just lay out quarter-to-date comps by banner or where we stand today in August so far?\nRichard Hayne: Sure. I'll do the first part. But if you'd sort of tell me in your question, do you want a specific brand? Are you talking about the Urban brand or are you talking about in general?\nMatthew Boss: The second part, if you could just lay out the three brands and where we stand...\nRichard Hayne: No, the first part.\nMatthew Boss: Quarter-to-date from a same-store sales. The first part, I think it would just be interesting in general, what you're seeing between occasion wear, return to work relative to the more casual categories.\nRichard Hayne: I got it. Well, when we look at the brands individually, the comps are very similar to what we experienced in Q2. Anthropologie is running just a tad ahead of where they -- they're Q2 comp came in. The Free People brand is essentially right on target to where they were in Q2, amazingly enough, because they were so elevated in Q2. And the Urban Outfitters brand, I've got to break down. Urban Outfitters in North America actually has seen benefits that Sheila discussed earlier, with comps in apparel getting better. However, Urban Outfitters in Europe has actually seen a decrease in comps and we attribute that to a very, very difficult environment. So we don't expect that to get too much better anytime real soon. So if you add all those up, stir them up, it's almost exactly where we were in Q2 within a couple of tens of basis points. So I think we're pretty confident that Q3 will look very similar to Q2. Now, I always have to talk about this by brand and I kind of hate to do that because the experts of the brand are sitting right next to me. But in Anthropologie, all of their categories performed very well, whether it was -- it's sort of what we usually talk about as their more polished look or whether it's the more casual look or even the vacation look. All of them have done well. When I look at the shoe assortment, as an example, heels, flats, sneakers, they're all -- boots, they're all doing well and they're are all driving double-digit comps. So I think all look seem to be doing well and I can't call out any one particular look as being overly strong. And I would say the same is true in Free People brand. All of their product and product categories delivered significant double-digit comps. So I can't really call out anything particular there. As Sheila did, their denim is performing quite well right now, but their knit tops are performing extremely well, as are sweaters. So I'm -- it is really across the board. With Free People Movement, the casual is doing slightly better than the performance, but they're both -- I mean, after all, their comps are 57%, so you can just imagine they're both incredibly strong.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker. Your line is open.\nMarni Shapiro: Hey, everybody. Congratulations on a great quarter and to the UO team for turning the corner there. Tricia, I wanted to dig -- I wanted to dig in a little bit at Anthropologie because of the increased marketing spend there and the fact that my for you page has been flooded with that amazing Falling for Anthro and all the post, it's amazing. So can you talk a little bit about it? Are you getting in -- and it sounds like you're getting a new younger customer. I'm curious if this customer is visiting more, are they spending about the same, because typically a younger customer might spend a little less. I'm also curious if the marketing push is global to put -- raise brand awareness as you open more stores, are you looking to open more stores internationally? And then I just have one follow-up on Anthropologie.\nTricia Smith: Sure. Thank you, Marni. I'll try to take them one at a time.\nRichard Hayne: Marni, that's quite a one...\nMarni Shapiro: And I'm not usually like that, but this campaign is so good [Multiple Speakers] the Free People Runsie, which is flooding my for you page as well and Roche.\nRichard Hayne: Okay.\nTricia Smith: No, we appreciate it. Yeah, our digital marketing team is really doing a fantastic job driving traffic with DTC and mid-double-digit traffic growth as far as high-single digit traffic. I think the -- that coupled with the improvements in our site experience and service in our stores, we're maintaining conversion, and so we're getting some real benefit. And the additional marketing spend, thank you for noticing. We just launched yesterday, our Falling for Anthro global. It is a global campaign starring actress Phoebe Tonkin. And the campaign is one of our largest marketing campaigns to date and our creative assets starring Phoebe will be amplified in a full 360 strategy that's inclusive of out-of-home advertising, billboards, Times Square in LA, Wildposting. So, a big push for us and it's one of our biggest. And it will also be our largest digital TV campaign to-date and really robust social media coverage, which is fun to see that you're seeing, and in-store events and more. And I think that the campaign itself is really intended for us to be able to build both connectivity and loyal community and while reaching this kind of new eager and excited audience. Our new customer, I think, through this kind of new to next strategy that our team has deployed around engaging a second purchase out of our new customers are younger, they're spending slightly less, but not as much less as I think you would think as our core customers. Really happy with the growth of our customer count, customer spend, and then our retained customer is spending more as well. So I think the marketing content is resonating kind of across multiple age demographics, both are retained and our new customers, and we're really, really pleased with the results.\nMarni Shapiro: That's amazing. And could I just follow up one quick one on Anthro because it sounds like the footwear is doing well. I'm curious if you see room to grow some of the other -- some high-margin categories like accessories, jewelry and handbags? They've all looked very good in the store. I'm curious if you still see room for growth in those categories?\nTricia Smith: Yeah. Thank you. We have really had a concerted effort in growing the accessories category and shoes. We, particularly in stores, have been testing some distorted category expansions to be able to see what that can do has proven incredibly successful. In some cases, it's driving a 1 basis point or 2 of comp for the entire box of the store with that expansion of accessories. So high margin in accessories, improving our total overall IMU as well as knit tops and a lot of high-margin kind of opening price point categories are allowing us, I think, to exceed our expectations on both customer acquisition as well as margin expansion. So we feel really good about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg (ph) with JJK Research Associates. Your line is open.\nJanet Kloppenburg: Hi, can you hear me?\nRichard Hayne: Yes, we can.\nJanet Kloppenburg: Okay. Congrats, everyone. Nice work. And Sheila, I really noticed the upgrade in the apparel at Urban. So I'm happy to hear that. I assume that the positive comps in apparel are at improved year-over-year margins. But as we look forward to the accessories turning positive in the third quarter, is there still hope that Urban could deliver flattish kind of fourth quarter comps? Or do you think we should be thinking down single digits for the second half of the year? And just for Melanie, I have been [indiscernible] by SG&A about plus mid-single for the back half. I think you had called for some moderation. I guess the incentive comp is pushing it up. But maybe you could help me there on how you think we should model it? Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. Let's start with, Sheila. And good news, right?\nSheila Harrington: Yeah. Good news. We've turned the corner in apparel. This is definitely happening first within stores. And so, I would like to say either we feel optimistic, but we're not ready to over-promise that that correction will happen in Q4, just based on how much promotional activity, Q4 normally lends to itself and what we're up against from last year's promotional activity. So we want to give ourselves time to really build our DTC strategy in a strong way for go forward. And that will take time to do well. That being said, the improvement in MMU is real and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement as we rectify our inventory levels with fresh newness.\nRichard Hayne: Yeah. Marni, I just will interject that we are definitely not ready to pass the champagne [Multiple Speakers] and we feel very good and positive about it. There's a lot of positive momentum, but there's a long way to go. And we do believe it's taken us longer than we had hoped, and we're not going to rush it, we're going to do it right. So Mel, you want to talk about...\nMelanie Marein-Efron: Yeah. And so, Janet, just to clarify, we are -- the remarks that I provided earlier are a bit of an update. Let me prop you through Q3 and Q4. So for Q3, based on our current plans, you are correct that SG&A could grow in the low-double-digit range as a result of higher incentive-based pay. In addition, we are incrementally increasing our marketing expenses for Free People, Anthro and Nuuly to increase customer acquisition and further drive our share gains. Given the top line strength of these businesses, it feels like the right time to make this investment distortion. And of course, if we do have some flexibility to reduce these planned increases should current sales momentum slow a little bit. Now with respect to Q4 and the remainder of the year after that, we believe that based on our current plans for sales and expenses, our Q4 SG&A expense growth could lag sales. So that's a bit of an update since the last quarter, I just wanted to clarify that for you.\nRichard Hayne: Yeah. And Janet, I think that the update Tricia gave about our marketing campaign -- the global marketing campaign is one good example of the investments that we're making in marketing in three of our four brands, but we're also doing that slightly in Urban as well. So we feel good about making those investments. And so far, we've seen a nice return wherever we have made them.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Congratulations on the nice results. As you mentioned...\nRichard Hayne: Thank you.\nDana Telsey: Hi. As you mentioned one of the remarks at the beginning, I think, customer favoring fashion over price. For each of the brands, what is happening with price? And what's changing this year as compared with last year? And then you gave a good update on Anthro with the potential for $2 billion in apparel and accessories sales, double Home to $1 billion and target 270 stores. As you think about Free People, any update on that and how you're thinking about what the long term could look like? Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: I'll take -- try to take the first question, because you ask about all the brands, although the focus on my right, please kick me if I misspeak. We think that in the Anthropologie, Free People and Free People Movement -- FP Movement brands, the customer is definitely favoring the fashion over price, and that's apparent to us. Fashion newness is what's most important. She responds when the product first comes in and she is less responsive to markdowns. It's not to say that price isn't at all important, but I do think it's secondary. At the Urban brand, I think it's a little bit different. I think that while she also, if the item is right, and I would call that jackets is a good example, if the item is right, she will spend a reasonable amount of money for the item. But we do see many of our opening price points over-indexing. And so I think that at the Urban brand, the price is probably equally important to the fashion. And secondarily, you wanted...\nSheila Harrington: Long-term Free People growth.\nRichard Hayne: Sure.\nSheila Harrington: Yeah. So I'm going to break it down into the two parts. FP Movement has been an incubated business for us, and we've started to grow this aggressively over the last several years. We think we'll be within $1 billion or more within the next five to six years. That's the goal that we've set for ourselves. And then with the Free People brand, we feel like there's tremendous opportunity for this to grow. I'm not going to quote that number, but our international business is growing and growing profitably, which we wanted to grow a global FP brand for quite some time, and we're feeling that traction take hold. That, along with some large market share classifications, I don't -- I think the sky is the limit for Free People.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you. Nice quarter. Wanted to ask about margins. Overall margins seem to be tracking in the mid-7% this year. Can you talk about the puts and takes to get to the 10% goal? You've made substantial progress in IMU, so I guess I'm wondering is the incremental improvement from here primarily a function of getting UO turning in the right direction? And then with the explosive growth you continue to achieve at Free People, how should we think about any step-up in reinvestment needs there in the near term beyond some of the incremental marketing investments you outlined? Thank you.\nFrank Conforti: Hey, Mark. This is Frank. I'll take that. So you are correct in that. Overall, we are still targeting. 10% operating profit rate as a company. I think we are feeling confident that we have the ability to do so and certainly our performance this year only increased our confidence. It's not just UO. I think each of the brands still have continued IMU improvement opportunity as you look into next year as well as the horizon. You are correct. Obviously, once we do turn the shift the way that we want to at Urban Outfitters, that can incrementally benefit our operating profitability as well. Lastly, I don't want to exclude Nuuly, one of our big growth initiatives and businesses that's performing well. We still remain committed to turning a profitable quarter over the back half of this year. And once Nuuly turns that quarter, I think that also can add to our overall operating profitability. So I think there are a lot of different drivers across the business between IMU, between improved markdown rates, between turning Urban around as well as Nuuly continuing to show their progress that that can help to contribute and leave us pretty confident that we can get to 10% and can continue to run at 10% operating profit.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby. And our last question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, guys. I was going to ask about the gross margin. So I guess is it -- relative to the 400 basis points in Q2 and the guide for Q3, can you maybe just contextualize like high level, how much of that is freight recapture, how much of that is better markdown? And then I just wanted to clarify, Frank, I think it was your comment about sustainability of that gross margin improvement through the end of the year. Should we believe that gross margins can continue to increase several hundred basis points into 4Q as well? Any color there would be great.\nFrank Conforti: Yeah, happy to take that, Ike. For the second quarter, IMU and markdown improvement was relatively even, maybe a little more shaded towards IMU. You asked about within IMU, how much is inbound transportation versus our initiatives? I would say inbound transportation cost savings right now are about two-thirds, and our cross-functional initiatives are driving about a-third of the benefit. And we think that those can continue for the back half of the year as well as into next year. As we're thinking about Q3 and Q4, we think about that opportunity in IMU could be fairly consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year, so about half of that 200 basis points of improvement. And we think there's roughly about that same type of improvement opportunity for, again, on a URBN basis, into Q3 as well as into Q4. Again, better inventory control. If you remember, there was a lot of inventory overhang at this time last year heading into the back half of the year that all three brands are now in a much better position on as well as the businesses at Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement performing at exceptional levels and Urban is starting to show improvement as well leaves us optimistic that we can drive that -- those increased benefits to markdown rates as well.\nIke Boruchow: Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. I think that concludes the call. Thank you very much for participating, and we hope to see you in a few months.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Now on to a review of Q1. We are delighted to report an excellent start to fiscal 2024. First quarter results topped our expectations discussed on the February call. Four of our five brands posted record first quarter revenues and total URBN delivered 6% revenue growth against a strong first quarter last year. Double-digit comp sales growth in both the store and digital channels at the Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands, more than offset a negative comp at the Urban Outfitters brand and drove total Retail segment comp sales up by 5%. Nuuly, our apparel rental service, continued to enjoy strong positive response to its business concept and product offering. Nuuly’s year-over-year revenues grew by 125% driven by a triple-digit gain in active subscribers, which totaled 167,000 at quarter’s end. Nuuly contributed $29 million in additional revenue versus last year’s first quarter. Wholesale revenue in the quarter declined by 11% as some of our larger partners sought to operate with leaner inventory levels and wrote smaller orders. Customer demand for fashion at the Anthropologie, Free People and FP Movement brands accelerated in Q1 versus last year and remained elevated throughout the quarter. The strength was driven by better fashion execution and stronger marketing, which created more customer traffic, including a double-digit increase in new customers in North America. Clearly, these brands are pleased in existing customers and capturing additional market share. We currently see no signs of change in customer behavior. No indication that customers are shopping less frequently, buying fewer items or trading down. Indeed, so far in May, total Retail segment comps are in line with the first quarter results and we believe that total Retail segment comps in Q2 could look very similar to Q1 print. Sales comps at the Urban Outfitters brand remain disappointed in Q1. That weakness has largely continued into May. We are planning for better women’s apparel comps during the back-to-school selling season beginning in July. Our recently reestablished speed-to-market capabilities that allow us to react faster to customer preferences, plus an adjustment in our pricing architecture that offers more opening price point items could help drive and maintain this improvement. Let me now turn your attention away from top line performance and focus on profitability. Here, the URBN achievement in Q1 was dramatic. The hostile operating environment over the last few years has finally abated. Freight rates have normalized, supply chain speed and reliability have returned, our IMU improvement initiatives have begun to bear fruit, and total inventories are down to last year and are once again growing at a slower rate than sales. All this resulted in a 260 basis point improvement in gross margins in Q1. In addition, Nuuly came within a whisker of reaching profitability in the quarter, and we remain confident that it will achieve that milestone in a future FY ‘24 quarter. In all, first quarter operating income soared 54% versus the prior year to $71.4 million, and earnings per share jumped 70% to a record $0.56. With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank to provide more details on our performance.\nFrank Conforti: Thank you, Dick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dick noted, the first quarter performed ahead of our expectations that we discussed on the February call. Total company sales grew by 6% to a first quarter record of $1.1 billion, driven by a total Retail segment comp increase of 5% and a Nuuly segment revenue increase of $29 million. These increases were partially offset by an 11% decline in Wholesale segment sales and close to 100 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The growth in Retail segment comp sales was driven by a high single-digit digital comp and a low single-digit positive store comp. Nuuly’s robust increase in revenue was due to a significant increase in subscribers from the prior year. Wholesale segment sales decline was due to a decrease at the Free People brand. Now moving to gross profit. Gross profit dollars increased by 15%, while gross profit rate improved by 260 basis points. The improvement in gross profit rate was primarily due to significantly improved initial margins. Each brand delivered improved initial margins in the quarter largely driven by lower inbound freight costs as well as several of our URBN cross-functional initiatives. Merchandise markdowns also improved in the quarter driven by the strong performance at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. As Melanie will discuss in more detail, we believe we can continue to drive improved IMU as well as lower markdown rates for the remainder of the year. As a result of our Q1 record sales as well as significant improvement in gross margin, our operating profit increased 54% from the previous year to $71 million, while earnings per share increased by 70% to a record Q1 of $0.56 per share. Next, I want to briefly touch on inventory. Over the second half of last year, we meaningfully improved our inventory to sales ratios, and we targeted fiscal ‘24 Q1 inventory levels at or below our sales growth rate. I am proud to say that is exactly what we delivered. I want to thank the brands, the sourcing team and shared partners for their fantastic execution. Total inventory versus last year is down 6% as of Q1 with Retail segment comp inventory up 4% and Wholesale segment inventory down 23%. Total company along with both segments, are below our sales variances. For the remainder of the year, we believe we can continue to manage inventory at or below sales growth, which should give us the opportunity to lower our overall markdown rate, increase our open to buy and allow us to chase into outperforming product. I will now provide more detail by brand. Starting with the Anthropologie Group, the Anthropologie team delivered an exceptionally strong 13% Retail segment comp in Q1. This increase was driven by double-digit positive store and digital comps. Both store and digital comps were driven by increased traffic, strong regular price sales and less promotions. Strong sales, improvements in IMU and record low first quarter markdown rates all led to a record first quarter in profit dollars for Anthropologie. The impressive quarterly performance was largely driven by apparel and accessories. Within apparel, the Anthropologie customer continues to respond favorably to fashion newness with strength across the brand’s more dressed-up categories such as pants, dresses, jackets and shoes with heels. As mentioned on the February call, the brand has started to see complementary growth of more casual and versatile product categories perform alongside the dresser occasion product. This trend continued throughout the quarter with all major apparel and accessory categories producing double-digit Reg price comps. In the quarter, new customer acquisition in North America increased by an impressive 11%, resulting in part from well-received marketing campaigns, great store experiences and of course, strong product execution. The strength across all apparel and accessory categories along with new customer acquisition has resulted in a nicely positive start to the second quarter, which has us optimistic that Anthropologie can continue to drive strong comps in the second quarter. Now I will call your attention to the Free People Group. Free People continue to deliver exceptional results, achieving record sales and profit dollars in the first quarter. Retail segment comps at the Free People Group were extraordinarily strong at 17% versus last year. Within the group, the Free People brand produced a 14% comp and FP Movement brand produced a robust 48% comp. Total Retail segment comp was driven by double-digit comps in the store and digital channels. These double-digit comps were driven by strong traffic growth in both channels, due in part to excellent marketing execution as well as average unit retail growth fueled by increased full price selling across all major product categories. Total customer growth also reached double-digit increases for the quarter at both the Free People and FP Movement brands. The customer response to the Free People Group spring and summer product trends, marketing campaigns and store experience have continued into May and we believe the Free People’s Group Retail segment performance could be nicely positive in Q2. Free People wholesale segment sales decreased 14% during the first quarter, which was in line with what we discussed on our last conference call in February. The decrease in sales was a result of weakness in department and specialty store accounts, partially offset by growth in closeout account partners. Wholesale segment profitability rebounded nicely from the lows recorded in the fourth quarter, but remained below the first quarter last year. With Q1 inventory levels now down 22% to last year, we believe we are in a much better position to further improve profitability as compared to the second half of last year. We believe wholesale segment sales will decline for the remainder of the year due to continued focus on the right balance of account partners and doors for the brand while the rate of profit could remain in a healthy low double-digit range. Now moving on to the Urban Outfitters brand. Urban recorded a 13%- Retail segment comp in Q1. UO’s negative comp was a result of disappointing performance in North America and a deceleration in the Urban business in Europe that had previously been delivering positive comps. In North America, both the stores and digital channel recorded negative double-digit comp sales. In Europe, the weakness was concentrated in the UK while the rest of Europe continued to see positive comps. As noted previously, we believe the macro environment in North America is having an outsized impact on the Urban Outfitters customer and has begun to weigh on the UK customer as well. While we know the macro environment for the Urban customer is not ideal, we also know we can execute better. The brand has done a good job in improving their inventory position. Total inventory is down 19%, while Retail segment comp inventory is down 15%. We believe the improved inventory to sales ratio will give the brand a better opportunity to chase into outperforming products as well as reduce their markdown rate. Finally, I will touch on the Nuuly business. Nuuly delivered an exceptionally strong Q1, beating our expectations for both top and bottom-line performance. Strong subscriber growth continued in the quarter with the current active subs now topping 167,000. We continue to believe active subs could approach or possibly exceed 200,000 by year-end. In addition to strong revenue numbers, Nuuly continues to make fast and steady strides towards profitability, nearly reaching break-even in Q1. We continue to believe Nuuly will record its first profitable quarter later this year. I will now turn the call to Melanie Marein-Efron, our Chief Financial Officer.\nMelanie Marein-Efron: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. Now I will discuss our thoughts on the second quarter and fiscal 2024 financial performance. We are pleased that overall consumer demand has remained strong to start the quarter, and we are planning for this strength to continue throughout the second quarter. Right now, we believe that second quarter total company sales growth could be mid-single digits. Sales growth in Q2 could result from mid-single-digit growth in Retail segment comp sales and high double-digit growth of Nuuly segment sales versus last year. Our growth in the Retail and Nuuly segments is likely to be partially offset by sales decline in our Wholesale segment. Additionally, similar to first quarter, we believe foreign exchange could negatively impact total sales growth by approximately 100 basis points. Now on to gross profit margin, we believe URBN’s gross margin rate for the second quarter could improve by nearly 300 basis points compared to the prior year second quarter. The increase in gross profit margin could be driven by higher initial product margins from lower inbound freight costs as well as lower merchandise markdowns. We have made significant progress over the past few quarters, controlling our inventory to sales ratio. In addition, an improved supply chain with faster speed and reliability versus last year, is allowing us to bring product in closer to demand. As a result of well-controlled inventory and healthier supply chain, we believe there could be lower markdowns in the second quarter compared to the prior year second quarter. Now moving on to SG&A expenses. Based on our current sales performance and plan, we believe SG&A growth for the second quarter will increase in the low double-digits. Our planned growth in SG&A could be primarily driven by higher overall payroll due to anticipated higher incentive pay from improved company performance, lower vacancy rates and higher payroll rates. In addition, we expect marketing expenses to support growth in customer and sales could be higher versus last year. This could result in SG&A rate deleveraged versus last year. As always, if sales performance fluctuates, we maintain a certain level of variable SG&A spending that we can adjust up and down depending on how business is performing. While we believe SG&A growth could outpace sales growth in Q2, we also believe that SG&A expense growth in the second half of the year will be more closely aligned with sales growth. We are currently planning our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for the second quarter and 25% for the full year. Now moving on to inventory. We believe that inventory levels in the second quarter could grow at a rate below sales growth. The team continues to be focused on speeding up inventory turns and managing inventory growth below sales for the remainder of the year as their target product turns closer to pre-pandemic levels. Capital expenditures for the fiscal year are planned at approximately $230 million. This spend is primarily related to investments in additional distribution facilities. In late summer, we will be opening our highly automated omni fulfillment facility in Kansas City, Kansas. In addition, we will be investing in a new rental fulfillment facility in Missouri within the Kansas City region. We are targeting to open this facility by the end of fiscal year ‘24. The new Missouri facility, along with our existing facility in Bristol, Pennsylvania, will support the growth and expansion of our Nuuly rental business in North America. Lastly, we will be opening approximately 33 new stores and closing approximately 24 stores during fiscal year 2024. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Now I am pleased to turn the call back over to Dick.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you, Mel, and thank you, Frank. In conclusion, as you have heard from Mel and Frank, we are confident about our prospects for the second quarter and optimistic for the entirety of fiscal 2024. We have 4 brands that are executing at rarefied levels and gaining market share. In addition to top line growth, we have significant margin recapture potential this year as demonstrated by our performance in the first quarter. This gives us additional opportunities to deliver improved profitability and EPS. All of this would not be possible without the hard work of our brand, and shared service leaders, their merchant, creative and operating teams and our 24,000 associates worldwide. Their amazing dedication and creativity produced a truly outstanding quarter and I thank them. I also recognize and thank our many partners around the world. Finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I turn the call over for your questions, I remind you to please keep your questions to one per caller, so we have time to recognize more of your colleagues. Thank you, and now for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Barclays.\nAdrienne Yih: Great. Okay. I am going to stick to one question, like the role say, Dick. One is on Urban Outfitters and negative double-digit comp. My question is what is the primary kind of you ranked three things or two things? What is the primary reason? Is it that the product is not correct or is it that you are holding back on the ability to kind of like put inventory out there because you don’t really believe that you are not buying behind it or is it the consumer?\nRichard Hayne: Okay, Adrienne. I am going to take a shot at starting this and then pass it on to Sheila, who is much closer to that than myself. I would say that there are 3 primary reasons, and I am not going to put them in any particular order of importance. Number one is the macro climate, which I think is working against the Urban Outfitters customer, as we have spoken about in the past, I think that – that has intensified somewhat as people’s take-home pay continues to erode from the inflationary pressures. So I think that is one. Number two, I think that the product is not where it should be. And we have made strides on that front, and Sheila will talk about that, particularly in the women’s area. And number three, I believe that when we planned the quarter, we planned inventory a little bit too lean, particularly in the women’s apparel area and sort of didn’t allow the women’s apparel sales to bloom as well as they may have if we have had a little bit more inventory. So those would be my three. Sheila, do you want to reinforce that, dispute that or add to it.\nSheila Harrington: I will add to it. I feel like from a product perspective and a flash inventory perspective, the brand did intentionally go into the quarter with controlled inventory levels. And like Dick said, maybe to controlled in some places, but to bring back the health of the business, I think that was really an important step and I commend the teams for that controlled inventory, it will set us in a good place from profitability, hopefully, in Q2. I do think we’re seeing some strong results from productivity within our women’s apparel business that we can continue to build on and react to because of our controlled inventory. So that feels very good. I feel like the teams are quite excited about their assortments and back-to-school where they have more of a range of sensibilities and are addressing what they feel like is more of the correct fashion for our consumer. And I would just add, we’re working on connecting and having customer insights into our consumer. And that’s an important piece of regrowth as we hired a Chief Customer Officer and want to get back to connecting to our core customer in a meaningful way and that’s part of our building blocks for the long term as well.\nAdrienne Yih: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Now that you’ve diagnosed the issues at Urban, can you discuss the drivers of your expectation for improved women’s apparel performance during back-to-school. And maybe just elaborate on how a more normal supply chain can help the Urban brand?\nSheila Harrington: So I think getting back to the speed model that Urban has been used to has been critical, and that’s why we feel like we have more confidence going into the back-to-school time frame, especially [indiscernible] August, end of July, as Dick said. I think there is a couple of things that are being forced corrected. One is the price architecture. I think over the last year, the brand has learned that it can sell the larger range of assortment up to a higher price point, but they have walked an opening price point value consumer. We feel very strongly that we’re seeing very good reads from Q1 into Q2 in key categories of which the team has already addressed this. So we feel very confident that, that will continue into back-to-school as we continue to chase into those correct products. And the other belief, I believe, is just understanding where the customer’s mindset is into fashion and the evolution of where the bottoms business is evolving to, I think we will be better – in better stock position than our bottoms assortment as well as price point going [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is open.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. Just to keep the Urban Outfitters team, UO. Can you talk about gross margin this quarter at UO and what you expect in 2Q? Just maybe anything else you could share about the overall path for profit improvement as we move through the year.\nFrank Conforti: Hey, Paul, this is Frank. I’ll take that one. And we really don’t give out specifics on – by brand, specific numbers by brand, from a gross profit margin perspective. With that being said, I can speak to urban as well as all of the URBN brands have made really healthy improvement in IMU and Urban certainly is not lagging where Free People and Anthropologie have from an execution standpoint there. And we think that, that continued – that IMU improvement will continue into the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. I would say additionally, as it relates to Urban, Sheila mentioned, inventory is in a much better position right now. So I think that gives them the opportunity with not being as heavy as we were last year to present a markdown rate improvement opportunity as the year progresses as well as they start to be able to chase into a product that’s performing well.\nPaul Lejuez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAlex Straton: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I want to make sure I understood kind of how you guys are positioning, how Urban panned out in the quarter. Does that mean that things strengthened throughout the quarter? Or did they stay the same? And maybe just the same question for Anthro and Free People is kind of if things got better, were more consistent or got worse in any case. Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Well, I will take the total brands to begin with, and then ask Sheila to talked about Urban. The quarter stayed pretty constant, a little bit stronger in February, but I would say, reasonably constant. And the good news is that sales to date in May have maintained the pace with the exception of Free People where we’ve actually seen a reasonably sharp increase in their digital business. So they are actually doing better. When you look at it overall across all brands, the Retail segment, we still believe that Q2 Retail segment comp will be in the mid-single-digit positive range, and we think that is very good news. Do you want to talk about the Urban?\nSheila Harrington: Urban. I think the performance of Urban as mentioned, is pretty steady between Q1 and Q2. It was pretty steady throughout the quarter as well. I think the inventory levels, like we said, have been controlled we are walking in speeding up as we see improvements in areas and especially the women’s area. We are up against a significant amount of markdown volume that we didn’t plan to anniversary going into May. So we’re hopeful that that’s where the hope is that we can produce a better profit for the company in Q2 by controlling the inventories and not buying into the markdowns again.\nAlex Straton: Alright.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks, and congrats on the nice quarter.\nRichard Hayne: Thank you.\nMatthew Boss: Dick, in what’s clearly a very dynamic macro backdrop, I guess, what do you believe is driving the sustained momentum or magnitude at Anthropologie and Free People. How best market share white space looking forward at these concepts? And just on the gross margin side, what – or how can you speak to overall visibility in terms of IMU recapture as we think about maybe the next 12 months? Just what’s the opportunity there?\nRichard Hayne: Well, I’ll let Frank talk about that. I’ll talk about what’s driving Anthro and Free People. I look at it as four factors: First and foremost is fashion execution. I think the brands, the creative people and the merchants have done an outstanding job calling the fashion. And obviously, the customers are responding. It has we said on the call earlier, it’s hitting more fashion silhouette and sensibilities and a couple of examples of that is Anthropologie’s Water Edge and what Free People call Free Us, which are different sensibilities than we had last year at this time. The second thing is all categories are working. So it’s oftentimes when one category like apparel is working, either intimates or accessories or shoes aren’t working right now at both Anthropologie and Free People. All categories are seeing that comp success. And so it plays on each category plays on the other. The third is the product mix is a little bit different this year. And in some cases, it’s creating higher AUR that with – along with lower markdowns are pushing the AUR so that same number of transactions will yield higher sales and higher comps. And then last and never least, I think we have better marketing across both of those brands. The marketing at Free People and Anthropologie is just outstanding. It’s cross-functional coordination and planning around the marketing campaigns has been terrific, and it just led to better customer engagement, better customer acquisition and higher traffic online and in stores.\nFrank Conforti: And then, Matt, as it relates to the visibility on IMU, I would call it the visibility high. And there are really two main things driving our IMU improvement across all of the brands. One is the recovery of cost of inbound freight. And as we sit here today, we have essentially recovered back to pre-pandemic levels. And obviously, that hasn’t been where we’ve been trading over the last few years. So we feel pretty comfortable about those gains and that opportunity for improvement for the remainder of the year. But I certainly also don’t want to discount the incremental work that’s being done by the brand sourcing and shared service teams, honestly, to drive even further value. It was about 1.5 years ago, we set out with a 500-basis-point improvement initiative across over URBN. And as Dick mentioned on our previous call, we believe by the time we reach the fourth quarter of this year, which would mark 2 years from the time that we stated that goal that we would have achieved approximately two-thirds of that goal. As we sit here today, it looks like we will probably be at that two-thirds, if not even closer, which is just great news. And the second part that’s not just the inbound freight cost that’s driving that relative to these initiatives is utilizing a greater rate of ocean versus air, which is enabled by several of the initiatives that the brands and sourcing teams have put into play, increasing our own brand penetration whereas I think right now as a company we’re at the highest rate of owned brand penetration we’ve ever had at URBN. We’re increasing our depth of product buys. As Sheila mentioned at the Urban Outfitters brand, as she’s seeing a higher rate of productivity per style. We’re also leveraging earlier and deeper fabric positioning across more styles, which is enabling favorable pricing as well as speed. And last but not least is a further utilization of our 3D product design program, which is enabled to gives us speed. It gives us cost and operational efficiencies across each of our brands.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Hi, Nice to see the progress. As you think about the real estate portion of your expansion this year, any difference even by brand where you’re expanding, what type of returns you’re looking for a change in square footage, certainly seems like the physical footprint has even more relevant. How are you adjusting or enhancing your box and the returns? Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Okay. Dana, I’ll take it and then maybe Frank wants to add something to it. When we look for new store locations, we’re looking pretty much in the areas that are producing the best results right now. And that tends to be the Southeast, the Southwest and the Midwest in places that we are, what I believe, is under-penetrated, prime example of that would be Florida. And we would anticipate opening more Anthropologie stores, more Free People stores and more Urban stores in Florida over the coming year or 2. And when we do that, the stores will probably be slightly smaller than what we currently have in the – in our portfolio because we see the smaller stores oftentimes have a higher return, and they will be perhaps in malls, but perhaps in centers, but most of the time, not stand-alone.\nFrank Conforti: And I think just to add to that, I know Dick taking the brand leaders leaving this as well. I think as you said, where we see the largest opportunity from an expanding perspective, not just from a geographical conversation, but from a brand conversation, the first thing that comes to my mind is really FP Movement. Those stores have performed exceptionally well. I think we’re in the mid-30s right now in stand-alone stores seeing productivity at really close to where the legacy Free People brand performs and for a brand that’s really in its early days and relatively low awareness still to have that level of productivity really leaves us excited about the number of stores where we can get to. And Sheila is going to look at me and sort of shift right here. And I think Dick and I talked – we’ve always talked in North America about our bigger brands being in that 200 to 250 opportunity type range. And I don’t think that, that’s an outlandish opportunity for the FP Movement brand. And if you think about where they are today and how well they are performing, I think that’s where I think from a brand perspective, our biggest door opportunity set.\nDana Telsey: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tracker. Your line is open.\nMarni Shapiro: Hi, everybody. Congratulations. The stores really have looked fantastic. Frank, I actually want to talk to you a little bit about – or find that – dig a little bit into the 10% operating margin goal because some of that should come back from the freight, some of that should come back from the improvement of Urban, could you just dive into a little bit like how much is Urban, how much is freight? And like what the other pieces are as we look forward.\nFrank Conforti: Yes, absolutely, Marni. Happy to answer that. So you’re absolutely correct. We are still targeting 10% operating profit rate. And honestly, I think as we sit here today, we feel confident that we have the ability to do so. We’re obviously – and happy to be delivering a healthy operating profit improvement this year. And right now, and unless a large macro event occurs, I think our first quarter gains will continue for the remainder of the year. I think as you spoke to some of the opportunities beyond this year, we still believe we have gross profit margin improvement from our IMU initiative. I think we believe across all three brands, we will be about two-thirds, it’s not a little bit more of the way by the time we hit the fourth quarter of this year, with additional IMU opportunity across all three brands next year. And I think there is also some markdown opportunity, and that’s largely going to be coming probably from the Urban Outfitters brand. I think obviously, Urban is not operating as we would like right now. And when that business recovers, it will contribute incrementally to our profitability. Lastly, I also don’t want to leave out Nuuly. I think we believe Nuuly has the opportunity to turn its first quarter of profit in the back half of this year, and we don’t think that that’s going to be a one-time event. As we enter into next year, we think that, that brand will be able to contribute to our overall profitability growth as well. So we’ve got a lot of different drivers across all of URBN that we believe gives us a real opportunity to hit 10% operating profit rate and it’s something that we certainly have targeted as a leadership team, and we talk about the time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Janet Joseph Kloppenburg from JJK Research Associates. Your line is open.\nJanet Kloppenburg: Hi, everybody and congratulations on a really nice performance. Just to go back to Urban Outfitters for a minute. It sounds like you’re really encouraged that the active school business especially in women’s could be great. And I’m just wondering if you’re still committed to the comps turning positive in the back-to-school season or how we should think about the sequential improvement expected at Urban Outfitters. And then I wondered across the three brands, what’s going on with pricing year-over-year and how we should think about price elevation opportunity for the remainder of the year? Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Sure, Janet. I don’t think we want to get ahead of ourselves here. First of all, we’re talking about women’s apparel category, which while it’s the biggest portion of the Urban brand, and it is the leader of the Urban brand, it’s certainly not the only category within it. And we expect that we have an opportunity to get back to, I will call flattish comps sometimes in the third quarter or even perhaps before that. So yes, we’re excited about some of the early reads that we’re seeing. We do believe when we deliver the additional inventory that I think the stores, particularly are requesting and make some other changes that we’ve discussed already that we can see some nice improvements. But I don’t want to overpromise that, that would be a very bad thing for us to do. And I think that once we get the urban women’s area, a little bit more under control, then we can spread that into accessories, shoes and intimates right now actually is doing very well. So some of the other categories. And what else was – price. Happy to talk about price. Basically, the price that we have – at prices that we are commanding have gone up in low double – low single digits. And some of that is being driven by the receipt pricing and some of it is being driven by lower markdowns and some of it is being driven by mix. So those things in combination have driven very nice AUR increases at the Anthropologie and Free People brands. And we believe that there is opportunity for us to continue to do that by even lower markdowns, but we’re not – we’re really not seeing or forecasting really higher initial retail prices.\nFrank Conforti: And Janet, I just want to add here because I think it’s a really important point that both Anthropologie and Free People brands are doing a great job, obviously, from a product and a marketing perspective. They are increasing their overall customer file and their traffic in stores are up nicely. They are sessions on the digital platforms are up nicely as well. So incremental to some of the AUR improvement, we are seeing increased transactions across both brands. And fortunately, I think that we’re probably gaining some market share because of the high level of the brands are operating at right now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our last question will come from the line of Jay Sole from UBS. Your line is open.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. I was just hoping maybe you could elaborate on SG&A a little bit. I think you talked about SG&A dollars up low double digit in Q2. Is the payroll and the marketing, is that sort of one-time? And then I guess on the comments on the second half of the year, would you expect like a normal seasonality for SG&A dollars for like Q3 SG&A dollars to be above Q2? If you could just give us a little bit more color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Hayne: Hi, Jay. Okay, I’m going to ask Melanie to take that question?\nMelanie Marein-Efron: Hi, Jay, just wanted to give you a perspective on the year. We do believe that the full year SG&A expense growth will be a few hundred basis points ahead of sales growth but it’s going to be a bit bumpy by quarter, and that’s really due to the level of bonus accrual in the prior year by quarter. So similar for the full year as the growth in SG&A in the quarter, it’s being driven by those compensation costs and marketing and creative to drive increased sales and customer growth. But specifically in Q2, we’re guiding the growth rate for SG&A to be in the low double digit, and that’s a result of our expectation for higher incentive-based compensation due to better business performance versus prior year.\nJay Sole: Got it. Understood. Thank you so much.\nRichard Hayne: I believe that ends the call. Thank you very much for joining us, and we will see you in a few months.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
