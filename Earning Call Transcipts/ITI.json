We open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Todd Kehrli of MKR Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTodd Kehrli: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss Iteris' financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ending on December 31, 2023. Joining us today are Iteris' President and CEO, Mr. Joe Bergera; and the company's CFO, Mr. Kerry Shiba. Following their remarks, we'll open the call for questions from the company's covering sell-side analysts. Then we will answer investor questions, if any that were submitted to the company in advance of the call, per the instructions in our press release dated January 25, 2024. Before we continue, we'd like to remind all participants that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events of the future performance of the company, which statements are based on current information, are subject to change and are not guarantees of future performance. Iteris is not undertaking an obligation to provide updates to these forward-looking statements in the future. Actual results may differ substantially from what is discussed today, and no one should assume that at a later date, the company's comments from today will still be valid. Iteris refers you to the documents that the company files from time to time with the SEC, specifically the company's most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, which contain and identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that are contained in any of the forward-looking statements. As always, you'll find a webcast replay of today's call on the Investors section of the company's website at www.iteris.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Iteris' President and CEO, Mr. Joe Bergera. Joe, please proceed.\nJoe Bergera: Great. Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon to everyone. I appreciate all of you joining us today to learn more about the company's significant progress. As a reminder, the concentration of holidays and inclement weather depressed third and fourth quarter sales relative to our first and second quarters. However, in fiscal 2023, supply chain constraints pushed product shipments from our fiscal 2023 first half to our fiscal 2023 second half, inverting normal seasonality and creating unusual prior period comparisons. Therefore, I'll reference both our third quarter and our nine-month results throughout today's prepared remarks to adjust for some distortions in the prior period comparisons. Iteris reported total revenue in our fiscal 2024 third quarter of $42.1 million in first nine months of $129.2 million, representing an increase of 4% and 14% year-over-year respectively. Due to the improvement in our supply chain position and the higher volume, we also experienced an increase in gross margin in the fiscal 2024 third quarter and nine months of 780 basis points and 1,250 basis points year-over-year respectively. In turn, our fiscal third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 million and nine-month adjusted EBITDA of $10 million improved $3.5 million and $18.1 million year-over-year respectively. In addition to the significant improvements in our income statement for the fiscal year-to-date, we continue to experience strong demand for our clear mobility platform. For example, our total qualified sales pipeline now exceeds $650 million and our third quarter and year-to-date win rates were 66% and 67% respectively. As context, a win rate of 66% to 67% is exceptional given there are often three or more bidders in any competitive procurement. Despite the high level of demand for our clear mobility platform, we did experience some bookings lumpiness, which is common in our industry during our third quarter. These delays included an almost $10 million signal timing order originally expected to occur in the third quarter that pushed to the right. Last week, we did receive official notice from the agency of its intent to award this contract to Iteris, but the order and associated booking is now not expected to occur until late in our fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of our next fiscal year. Due to these customer delays, we recorded fiscal 2024 third quarter total net bookings of $31.4 million, resulting in total ending backlog of $113.3 million, which was up 1% year-over-year. Based on our expected fourth quarter bookings forecast, that includes some orders that were previously forecast to occur in our fiscal 2024 third quarter, we expect fiscal 2024 fourth quarter bookings to reflect significant sequential and year-over-year bookings growth. In turn, this will drive further improvements in our total ending backlog. As a reminder, our reported net bookings are comprised of firm customer orders, meaning net bookings represent only a portion of the total value of all contracts in hand. Historically, total contract value averages about 200% of our total ending backlog. Based on this math, total contract value as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $225 million, despite the softness in third quarter net bookings. To help you better understand our consolidated results, I'd like to share some details about the performance of our product portfolio. As noted previously, product revenue includes sales of our sensors, as well as certain third party hardware.  In fiscal 2024, third quarter product revenue was $23.1 million, and nine month product revenue was $70.2 million, representing a 1% and 17% increase year-over-year respectively. As a reminder, these year-over-year comparisons are distorted by unusual prior period shipping patterns. In addition to our continued product revenue growth, we realize significant improvements in product gross margin as we move beyond last year's global supply chain issues. Our product gross margin in the fiscal 2024 third quarter was 43.9% and first nine months was 45.6%, representing a 1,380 and 2,500 basis point improvement year-over-year respectively. Despite some customer delays that occurred across our industry, we continue to win virtually every large-scale intersection modernization initiative in the market. Leverage our leadership and video detection to penetrate adjacent categories, including the emerging cellular vehicle to everything or CV2X category, and attach annual recurring revenue to our vantage and spectra connected vehicle sensors. To maintain this market leadership, we released important new capabilities in the fiscal 2024 third quarter that will continue to expand our qualified sales pipeline and drive above market growth rates going forward. For example, on December 6, 2024, we announced that VantageCare is available with all Vantage sensors as a managed service. VantageCare is a comprehensive program that helps transportation agencies optimize their Iteris' traffic detection technology to improve overall intersection performance. We believe this program will help agencies better maximize their traffic detection investments and ensure more efficient, safe, and reliable travel through intersections. Then on December 13, 2024, we launched Vantage CV, which is an integrated detection and connected vehicle system for safe intersections. Vantage CV combines traffic detection, cellular vehicle to everything communication, and connected vehicle safety applications into a single system. With this release, our Vantage Next and Vantage Apex product families will now support certain sensor fusion capabilities we developed in partnership with Continental AG, in which we've talked about previously. Vantage Next and Vantage Apex will inherit additional sensor fusion capabilities in our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. Now I'd like to provide some more color on our services portfolio, which includes our consulting services, managed services, software as a service, and data the service offers. We reported fiscal 2024 third quarter service revenue of $19 million and nine month service revenue of $59 million, representing a 7% and 10% increase year-over-year respectively. Due to an improvement in our internal labor capacity in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, we also realized the 60 basis points improvement in our services gross margin. However, our nine month services gross margin was 210 basis points below the same prior year period due to a particularly high mix of subcontract labor in our fiscal 2024 first half. As with our product portfolio, the demand for our services portfolio remains very strong, whether measured by our historic sales pipeline, or nine month services net bookings of $70.6 million, which are up 19% year-over-year, despite the bookings delays encountered in our fiscal 2024 third quarter. To sustain strong demand for our services portfolio, we continued to introduce important new enhancements to our clear mobility platform and extend the platform's ecosystem. For example, in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, we released VantageARGUS CV, the next generation travel time and connected vehicle data collection and presentation system. We also announced the new partnership with Arity, which is a mobility and data analytics company owned by the Allstate Corporation. This partnership further enriches our mobility data sets and improves our ability to address various new end markets. As a result of our significant traction in North America, we continue to experience inbound demand from various international markets, which will continue to evaluate opportunistically. For example, in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, we signed a contract to develop an intelligent transportation systems master plan for the metropolitan area of Cebu, which is a major domestic and international port in the Philippines. In summary, we're pleased with our fiscal 2024 third quarter and first nine month revenue, our gross margin and adjusted EBITDA improvement. We continue to deliver against our ClearMobility platform roadmap and our commercial execution remain very strong, especially as measured by our qualified sales pipeline and competitive win rate. Therefore, we continue to believe our platform strategy will drive significant customer value, resulting in sustained above market growth rates going forward. So on that note, I'm going to pass the mic to Kerry to provide more color on our fiscal '24 third quarter and nine month financial results, after which I'm going to come back and I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year.\nKerry Shiba: Thanks Joe, and good afternoon everyone. As you review our third quarter results, I encourage you to consider Joe's comments regarding our nine month revenue results when assessing the overall momentum of the business. You may recall that I talked about the seasonality dynamic on last quarter's call, because Joe provided this context already on this call. I'll focus my current comments primarily on third quarter results. As Joe also described, we continue to make exciting commercial progress. I only want to underscore that our strength in the market continues to be demonstrated by strong double digit revenue growth for the first nine months, a significant sales pipeline, and an expectation for strong fourth quarter bookings. Because Joe already addressed revenue results, I will move down the income statement to the gross profit line and expand some on the commentary Joe provided. As Joe noted, the impact of improved supply chain dynamics was reflected in our gross profit performance. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, i.e. last year, we expensed about $3.9 million of negative purchase price variance, which compares to only 400,000 in the current year third quarter. As you may recall, last year's negative purchase price variance resulted from aftermarket purchases of semiconductors and other electronics components. On a consolidated basis, fiscal 2024 third quarter consolidated gross profit reached $15.5 million, an improvement of 32% over last year. Products gross profit drove about 88% of the total improvement, increasing 48%, while our services gross profit grew 9%. The products gross profit growth basically reflects supply chain improvement with the benefit of a 1% revenue growth offset by a slightly weaker product mix. The services gross profit improvement reflects higher sales, as well as a stronger labor mix resulting from increased internal labor capacity when compared to last year. Looking at gross margins, the third quarter of this year improved by 780 basis points in the aggregate, reaching 36.9% in total, the increase was driven by a 1380 basis point improvement for products, which was augmented by a 60 basis point increase for services. Product gross margin was 43.9% for the current year third quarter, and as I just mentioned, the benefit of having last year's negative cost impact from supply chain issues clearly behind us was offset slightly by a weaker product mix. Gross margin for services was 28.4% for the third quarter this year, with the increase due to the improvement in labor mix relative to the same period last year. Operating expenses in aggregate were 8% higher in the current year third quarter when compared to the same period last year, and 162 basis points higher measured as a percent of revenue. In general, prior year cost levels reflect very tight spending controls imposed in the midst of the supply chain crisis. The current year increase was most significant in the research and development category, and reflects increased activity focused on improving our software products. Sales and marketing expense also was higher due to increased commissions and G&A expense decline when compared to last year as lower salaries and wages cost and professional services cost declines were offset partially by higher litigation costs. The factors just discussed related to revenue, gross profit, and operating expense fundamentally explain the major comparisons in operating income, net income, and adjusted EBITDA. As Joe mentioned, adjusted EBITDA was $3.1 million for the third quarter and improvement of $3.5 million compared to the same period last year. This brings adjusted EBITDA to $10.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, a turnaround of $18.1 million over last year. Total cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter this year was $21.2 million which was $11 million above the balance at the same time last year, and $1 million higher than the balance at the end of last quarter. Cash flow for this year's third quarter included a variety of items, including $200,000 for share repurchases and $900,000 for capital investments, primarily in new software development, as well as $800,000 in fees related to a non-routine legal matter that we discussed on our prior earnings call, and finally a $700,000 increase in inventories. The improvement from last year continues to reflect the combination of higher income and strong balance sheet management, while cash trajectory can always be affected in the short term around balance sheet cutoffs. Future earnings improvement and good balance sheet management provide the foundation for continued liquidity improvement going forward. I now will turn the call back over to Joe who will discuss our fiscal 2024 guidance update and provide closing comments.\nJoe Bergera: Great. Thank you, Kerry. The smart mobility infrastructure management market, in our opinion, represents a significant long-term opportunity due to historic federal funding that's been committed by Congress through 2026, but should have a multi-year funding tail as state and local agencies will continue to spend obligated funds well past the legislation statutory end date. Additionally, technology trends that include the adoption of cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and connected and autonomous vehicles will continue to drive significant investments from state and local agencies, as well as various private sector entities. Given the breadth of our platform capabilities, significant brand equity, and extensive customer reach, we're very optimistic about Iteris's ability to capture a disproportionate share of this revenue stream. Iteris will continue to deliver against an aggressive fiscal 2024 roadmap with the following major releases in our fourth quarter. The release of a new state-of-the-industry software as a service solution will use both probe and infrastructure-based data sets to characterize and optimize the performance of individual intersections and entire transportation corridors. We believe this new solution, which can be provisioned dynamically, will further expand our addressable market. Second, the introduction of an integrated communication module to facilitate more efficient communication between our Vantage sensors and our clear mobility cloud, which we expect to drive more VantageCare up-sale revenue and accelerate the attach rate of ARR to our sensor install base. And third, the application of additional artificial intelligence capabilities at various levels of the ClearMobility platform will further enhance our ability to identify, verify, and predict certain transportation events. As noted on previous calls, we believe our fiscal 2024 release plan will continue to drive further adoption of the ClearMobility platform, increase our wallet share among existing customers, and improve the monetization of our expanding mobility data sets. Over the long term, we believe these dynamics will support an above-market rate of growth in our total bookings, as well as continue to increase the average size of individual bookings. In addition to focusing on our solutions portfolio, in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we'll continue to pursue key operational priorities, including the productivity of our distributor network, the maturity of our customer success function, and internal labor capacity of our consulting teams. As a reminder, the tactics outlined on our prior earnings call are already producing a measurable improvement year-to-date in our internal labor capacity. Based on recent market feedback, we've also made an operational decision to continue to reduce our lead times to ship certain sensor product lines, which we determined to be a significant point of competitive differentiation. Before I address our guidance, I want to reiterate that supply chain constraints in fiscal 2023 push product shipments from our fiscal 2023 first half for our fiscal 2023 second half, inverting normal seasonality, and creating unusual prior period comparisons. Additionally, the fiscal 2024 third quarter bookings delays, which are only temporary, may shift some revenue recognition from our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter to subsequent periods. With this context, we're tightening our full-year revenue guidance to a range of $171 million to $173 million, representing organic revenue growth of 10% at the midpoint of our range. We're reiterating our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 79%, representing a significant improvement year-over-year, and we're adjusting our full-year net cash flow guidance to a range of $8 million and $12 million. This adjustment is due largely to a recent operational decision to build and maintain higher inventory to further reduce lead times to ship certain sensors, and also due to the timing of expenses for the unplanned litigation that we referenced on our prior earnings call. Despite the adjustment to our net cash flow guidance, the new range would represent a $17.1 million increase year-over-year at the midpoint. Looking beyond fiscal 2024, we believe Iteris remains on track to achieve our vision 2027 targets. In other words, we continue to estimate fiscal 2027 revenue in the range of $245 million to $265 million before any additional acquisitions. This represents a 5-year organic revenue CAGR of 13.7% at the midpoint, which I would point out is consistent with the average of our fiscal 2023 actual growth rate in the midpoint of our fiscal 2024 revenue range. With this substantial increase in revenue over the five-year period, we anticipate progressive benefits from economies of scale to result in fiscal 2027 adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 16% to 19%. Additionally, we anticipate that further improvements in our liquidity will enable Iteris to resume our acquisition program, which would be additive to our organic vision 2027 targets. So with that in mind, I would be delighted to respond to any questions and comments. And so, I'll pass it back to you, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Jeff Van Sinderen from B Riley. Jeff, your line is live.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Hi, everyone. Joe, the numbers you just gave, those were the FY '27 targets. Did I get that right, the 245 to 265 in revenues in the 16 to 19 in EBITDA, is that right?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, correct.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Okay. Just want to clarify that. And then maybe just kind of shifting and realize there can always be things that kind of move around in bookings and so forth, just kind of nature of the beast. But just kind of best guess you have at this point as far as business mix in Q4, and then I don't know if Kerry wants to weigh in on this, but consolidated gross margin that we might expect for Q4. And then I guess any guidance you could give us for Q4 on OpEx and realize you're not giving guidance on this, but maybe early thoughts on revenue growth, the gross margin OpEx for the fiscal year that's about to begin? Realize there's a lot of questions packed in there.\nJoe Bergera: It's like hard to keep track of all those questions within questions there. But I guess I'll just start off and I'm going to pass it to Kerry. But I would say that we -- as I already mentioned, in our industry, bookings tend to be very lumpy. Actually, as you'll recall, for the last several quarters, our bookings have fallen within a fairly small range, which has actually been very unusual. So the experience that we had in the third quarter is much more typical of what we'd expect to see across the industry. And there were a couple large bookings, which we didn't recognize, we didn't receive and didn't record in the December 31 period that will fall into the fourth quarter, one or two in the mail, so fall into the first quarter of our new fiscal year. So again, we're not going to provide any guidance, but we expect to have very strong bookings in both the fourth and the first quarter. And I think it's just talk at a really high level regarding mix. We would expect to see healthy bookings of both, you know, a service's nature, and then also a product nature. And I'd further add that we would expect to see a lot of the service's bookings to have high annual recurring revenue content to them. But anyway, with that, I'm going to, Kerry, if you don't mind, I'm going to pass it to you to respond to Jeff's kind of more specific financial questions.\nKerry Shiba: Sorry, come off mute. Hi, Jeff. And I may have missed some of them. So repeat if I don't respond to something. With regard to the gross margin expectation for the fourth quarter, it should be stronger than what we saw in Q3. And I would say somewhere in the range of a couple hundred basis points improvement. And I think we would expect for that to be primarily product mix driven and then continued improvement of our labor utilization and labor capacity and utilization in contrast to, you know, some contractor labor where we don't really get a markup on it. I think you asked about some expense guidance. And in the G&A category, I'd expect us to be -- by the time we finish the year, we ought to be in the 13% to 15% of revenues range. This would be primarily normal inflationary increases. And then that's the line item where the litigation, the unique litigation cost comes through. Also, by the time we finished the year, we'd expect sales and marketing to be in the range of 14% to 15% of revenues. And then R&D, again, would be in the 5% to 7% of revenues range for the entire year. Kind of you'd have to come back and back calculate the fourth quarter itself, but that's how we would look at the year finishing out.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Okay, great. And then, sorry, go ahead.\nJoe Bergera: Jeff, I was also just going to say before you leave us, I was just reflecting on your initial question about our vision 2027 targets. And I just wanted to confirm that expected revenue range in our fiscal '27 would be between $245 million and $365 million revenue. And that's on a strictly organic basis. But I think you also made a reference to EBITDA. And I wanted to make sure that I was clear that our expectation would be EBITDA margins in the range of 16% to 19% as opposed to absolute EBITDA in the range of $16 million to $19 million. I just want to make sure that that was very clear.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Yes.\nJoe Bergera: Okay, thank you.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Good point. I'm glad you clarified that. And then just any early thoughts, and again, I realize you're not giving guidance on this, but any early thoughts on the fiscal year that's about to begin in terms of, I know you spoke to sort of above industry growth rates, is the next fiscal year, a year in which you think you would be running an above industry growth rate? And then maybe, you know, should we anticipate gross margin improvement further incremental gross margin improvement in the New Year, and then leverage on OpEx to get to substantially higher adjusted EBITDA margins?\nJoe Bergera: So Jeff, we go through this every year, and I appreciate your tenacity, but you know, we obviously don't want to provide fiscal '25 guidance at this point. We'll certainly do that on our next earnings call. But with respect to just kind of base lining on kind of industry growth rates, I do want to remind everybody that, we believe that historic average growth rates in our industry are in the range of about 8% to 9%. And so, I just want to be clear that even at the midpoint of our current guidance, which is 10%, we would be growing above growth rates. And again, the average growth rate between last, if you consider last year's actuals, and the midpoint of our current range, over the two years, we're averaging about 13.5, 13.6 rate of revenue growth, which is more than 50% higher than the historical average growth rate. So I want to be very, very clear about that. But anyway, I think your bigger -- the other part of your question is, do you expect to see some kind of a step up in your rate of growth in FY '25? And again, we'll go through our guidance on our next call. But overall, we feel very optimistic about our fourth quarter and first quarter bookings, which should set us up for some kind of a step up year-over-year in terms of our annual growth rate.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Okay, great. That's really helpful. Appreciate you taking all my questions. I'll take the rest offline. Thanks.\nJoe Bergera: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Latimore from Northland Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Latimore: All right. Thanks. Yes. Good to see the strong profits here. I guess on the fourth quarter bookings, it sounds like you're expecting strong bookings there. If this $10 million deal ends up in the first quarter, will you still see strong sequential booking?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, we would expect to have strong bookings in the fourth quarter, regardless.\nMike Latimore: Okay.\nJoe Bergera: And to be clear, it wasn't only that one order that slipped from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. There were actually a handful of relatively large ones. That particular one is not only large, but we wanted to offer that additional commentary, because it's very clear that we'd expected originally to receive that order in December 31 period, and subsequently, we got the notice of intent to award even just last week. So I just thought it was a very specific thing that we could reference to help people understand how some of these things tend to slip even a few weeks makes a big difference. But again, I want to be clear that was not the only order that pushed from the third quarter into the fourth.\nMike Latimore: Yes. Got it. The pipeline sounds strong. I don't have a number from last year. Do you know, like, is that up materially from last year, that $650 million pipeline?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, it'd be up substantially.\nMike Latimore: Okay. And then on the service attach rate on the sensor deals, how is that trending? What are you seeing there?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, it continues to be really strong. I don't have that number at hand. I'll be happy to get it to you following the call. But my expectation is that it would be consistent with what we've been experiencing in the last couple quarters, which has been in the 20% to 30% range.\nMike Latimore: Yes. And then is the labor availability -- is labor availability loosening generally? It sounds like you guys are at least being able to hire internally, but what about just kind of among your subcontractors and customers and so on?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, that's a good question. So, as I talked about on our last call, our impression is a generally the labor market does seem to be loosening. We had for some period of time had a very difficult time hiring like software developers, for example. There have been a lot of publicized stories about big tech and small and medium-sized technology companies. In some cases, some reorganization, which has resulted in some job elimination, and also just kind of reducing their hiring plans. And that's certainly benefited us. We've definitely seen the availability of that kind of talent improve. The area where things still remain tight is traffic engineers, which is something we've talked about previously. And if you look at the US DOT's research, there's still no particular shortage of talent broadly in the transportation market, and then more specifically with respect to traffic engineers and civil engineers, because we're just simply not seeing as many people graduating from those programs today as we did five and 10 and 15 years ago. So, you have more people, you know, competing for a relatively small pool. But one of the things that we've introduced, we talked about on a prior call, was its various activities to try to source that kind of talent from international markets. And we're definitely finding that to be successful. And as I mentioned, I didn't go into a lot of detail, but we did see an improvement in our labor capacity in the December 31 period. And we have a very healthy pipeline of applicants with, you know, we have obviously internal expectations in terms of how many of those we're going to be able to convert to new employees. And so our expectation is we'll continue to see an improvement in our labor capacity in our fourth and our first quarter and even beyond. So, to answer your question, in some respects, we see the market loosening. In other respects, we actually just think it's, you know, certain tactics that we've undertaken are starting to bear fruit and that's improving our position, even though I do think that the availability of traffic engineering talent in particular remains very tight.\nMike Latimore: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question is coming from Ryan Sigdahl from Craig Holland Capital Group. Ryan, your line is live.\nRyan Sigdahl: Hey guys, good afternoon. Not to beat a dead horse here, but on the deferrals with the bookings, I guess, what's the underlying reasons for the delays? Because I just went back many, many years and kind of skipped COVID years, but it seems like there's always kind of some that slips, some that come in, and it's usually pretty consistent from a booking standpoint quarter-to-quarter. So I guess here's the underlying reasons. And then second to that, any impact from kind of uncertainty with federal government funding bill and getting the stopgap, but not, not a real permanent one yet?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, so the -- I think that's kind of interesting, Ryan, because I don't think that we've historically reported enterprise level bookings. I think that if you went back through prior periods, we did talk about our services bookings, but I'm not sure whether we provided a combined, a consolidated bookings figure. So I think it might be hard for you to compare those things, but perhaps I'm wrong. But anyway, our internal view is that particularly we've seen a high degree of variability in, like, our products bookings, it's associated with our sensor bookings and some of our third-party products. And so our experience in the December 31 period wasn't really different than what we saw pre-COVID. But anyway, as I said, there were a couple of large bookings that were delayed for various reasons. And, you know, because of their relative size, it had a big impact on the total bookings number. And there are very specific things that I won't belabor regarding each of those individual bookings. But I think to your broader point is that some degree of budget uncertainty, has that had any sort of an impact? And I would say that probably at the margins it has. I mean, if I were to go -- I could walk you through each individual, you know, instance, there are, like, again, particular things that occurred. But if you try to distill that down to sort of what's happening, I'd say that, you know, at the margins there's a slight degree of hesitation at the state and local level as they're trying to understand what the federal budget landscape looks like. Again, if you look at the total amount of spending in the country, over 80% of it is coming from state and local revenue sources. So it's not like the federal government represents the majority of the funding. But that being said, some of these state and local agencies not knowing what the status is of some of these federal funds, that can cause at the margins some hesitation. And so we did see that. But I think that the bigger issue is it really goes back to the staffing point that, you know, we talked about previously. It's simply there's a shortage, generally, of transportation labor, and then more specifically, traffic engineering, civil engineering, talent, some of which would logically be playing program management roles for these various state and local agencies. And so what's kind of broadly happened is the federal government's increased the amount of federal funding substantially by 50, in some cases, depending on the specific category as much as 100% for what the historical level has been. But, state and local agencies were not able to increase their employee base by 50% to 100% in order to be able to move all those funds through the pipeline. And so, there are delays. And to some degree, it has to do with the uncertainty. But I think the bigger factor is like right now, there just aren't enough program management staff, most of whom would typically have traffic engineering backgrounds to be able to program that funding and then distribute it to third parties like Iteris. And so, as much as the agencies are attempting to do that, we do continue to see that there are delays and they sometimes are not able to deliver against their best, their best estimates that they provide us in terms of when to expect orders.\nKerry Shiba: Joe, one other thing for Ryan, as far as the unevenness or the lumpiness in the bookings, I think over time, the company has focused more and more on the large contract opportunities. And so, as a result of just having a population of collection of all smaller deals, there's bound to be more volatility based on the timing of these specific large projects. And as the company continues its focus on that end of the opportunity scale, it's also going to result in some of the volatility quarter-to-quarter.\nJoe Bergera: Agreed. Kerry, I appreciate bringing that up. And Ryan, that is something that we have, I think, talked about routinely on these calls, that as we focus more and more on some of these large deals, and we have more exposure to a relatively small number of very large transactions, it is, we've tried to tell people that they should expect to see some degree of lumpiness, which is what occurred in the December 31 period.\nRyan Sigdahl: Yes, makes a lot of sense, just hadn't been as evident until this quarter, but makes sense. Switching over, curious on some of the Philippines, I guess, how that contract culminated and what the international strategy is going forward for Iteris?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, sure. So we've -- as I mentioned, it kind of has to do broadly with just the amount of market visibility that we have in the North American market. And so to be clear, there isn't somebody in like Cebu, Philippines that necessarily knew about us. But what is happening is international development banks and global construction firms that operate on a worldwide basis, and obviously like the World Bank, which is based in Washington, DC, and other global construction firms that have a big presence in North America, we're on their radar screen. And so those entities that are bringing us into these kinds of opportunities, the most with respect to the Cebu opportunity that is partially funded by the World Bank. And that there's someone in Washington, DC, aware of the work that we've been doing in North America that approached us about this opportunity and we thought it made strategic sense. And also we're glad to help the Philippines.\nRyan Sigdahl: Good. Last one for me. The Allstate partnership, anything you can comment from, I guess, financials or impact to Iteris?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, so that's an interesting partnership. We're obviously super excited about it. So in the initial phase, what we're doing is we're getting access to certain data sets that the Allstate company has. We use that to enhance our analytics, supplement our own existing data sets. And actually, some of that data is critical to the probe-based SPM product. That's a product release that I mentioned is going to be available this quarter, actually, we're introducing to the market, and so that the Allstate relationship was essential to being able to launch that on time. Additionally, this relationship and the underlying data sets we think is going to provide access to other markets beyond the public sector. And as we've mentioned previously, some of those markets include the insurance sector. And we do believe that the combination of these various data sets, including the Allstate or Arity data, in combination with some of our data science expertise and other domain knowledge, will allow us to be able to package some of this data and produce insights that we think will have value, again, to various markets beyond the public sector, including the insurance market.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nJoe Bergera: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Tim Moore from EF Hutton. Tim, your line is live.\nTim Moore: Thanks. And half my prepared question is already answered. But I really kind of want to just delve in a little bit more to what you're maybe noticing with customer conversion timing and their behavior and implementation. I'm just wondering, do you think of the slower start to this calendar year? Or do you think its maybe because some of the agencies are taking longer because you're cross-selling them a larger ticket order value than a few years ago?\nJoe Bergera: Those are great questions. I do think and we've tried to kind of make this point maybe not very well. But as we do pursue more and more of these large transactions, by definition, they're more complex. And to your point, Tim, you're right. Being more complex, the evaluation process gets extended. And so that is a phenomenon that's occurring and it is impacting the business. So I think that that point is correct.\nTim Moore: Good. That's helpful. And I know Kerry started addressing some of my next question earlier. And I know, Joe, you mentioned the traffic engineer's shortage. But something I've always kind of watched you in just having been on the buy side, knowing that outsourced labor and subcontractors are usually a margin drag. But you guys have been making great progress on that with the consulting labor capacity. I know it was a drag last winter, then even the spring this year on your gross margin. But anyway, to just ballpark or give us a rough estimate of maybe what inning you're in or percentage wise, maybe getting fulfilled with the internal consultants, you know, talented element they've been working on, you know, you're always going to have some contractor work every quarter, but just maybe are you like two thirds of the way there to be pretty happy and fulfilled on that? Or you think it's another quarter or two to kind of nail that down and not need to be as reliant on the subcontractors?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, so I'll start and then Kerry maybe you can talk about it. And I guess the two points that I want to make. One is that, we expect our consulting business to continue to grow. And as a result, we not only need to solve for the current labor capacity requirements, but for future labor capacity requirements, right, as the business continues to scale. So, therefore, this effort is going to continue for probably at least the next two to four quarters until I think we do get to a point where hopefully there'll be some broader loosening in the labor market. And it will get a little bit easier. So, just to sort of manage expectations, I think we'll continue to talk about this for at least the next four quarters. But the other bigger point that I want to make is when you look at our services gross margin, the bigger opportunity for material improvement is actually going to be as our software as a service and our data as a service revenue increases, because the fixed costs for those services are fixed. And we expect to see significant cost leverage as we add every sort of incremental million dollars in SaaS and DaaS revenue. And so that's what's going to really drive a change in our services gross margins. Kerry I don't know if you want to add anything additional.\nKerry Shiba: I don't think so. I think your comment that you just offered on the SaaS business is probably the most important one with regard to future trajectory of margin growth on the services business. The labor capacity, internal labor capacity, I would agree with Joe, this is going to be an ongoing effort. And I think it's going to be an effort that continues throughout probably at least the next four quarters before we could say we've reached a point where we're more satisfied with the staffing level. There's going to be some investment in these people up front also, Tim, so they're not going to hit the ground with as much productivity as they will be after they've had a little bit of time under their belt with us. But nonetheless, is that even at the beginning as you're displacing subcontractor labor, that's still going to be some urgent upside force there.\nTim Moore: Thanks for that timing update on the talent development. That's really good. I know I've asked about that a couple quarters ago, but this is a really helpful update. And it's a great reminder on the incremental staff margin mix. I mean, because it's such a step up incremental margin, almost a hockey stick as you get to the operating scale and revenues there. So my last question is really around the acquisitions update and the funnel update and just related to the international growth comments kind of gave earlier today in the Philippines. Do you think that the targets for doing the acquisitions are still going to be solely in the United States near term?\nJoe Bergera: So I'll start off by saying we're only looking at international opportunities opportunistically, you know, as I said, or situationally. It's not to say that we would never do an international acquisition, but the opportunity in front of us in the North America market is so substantial that that's really what we're focused on. And most all the acquisition opportunities that we're -- you know, they're currently on our radar in North America. Kerry, I don't know if you want to offer any additional comments with respect to the status of our acquisition activities.\nA – Kerry Shiba: Well, I think, and this is really a continuation, I think, of comments last quarter to the pipeline of opportunities continues to be fairly rich. And so I think that our view of kind of overall of the business accomplishing or closing a transaction kind of once every 12 to 18 months is probably still a fair target. I think we've talked about kind of the mix of businesses that are out there and some of the challenges the SaaS businesses still have a challenge with regard to valuation or pricing relative to what our multiples are at. So we have to be very cognizant of that. And they tend to be much smaller and therefore time consuming. And even if they can augment our IP in some way, it's still pretty typical. These are small, typically kind of venture capital-back businesses, pre-revenue or early revenue stages, and therefore still relying some cash portal on the way. So we're still focused on trying to ensure that whatever deals we do that they will be immediately accretive. And the marketplace of potential opportunities really hasn't changed a whole lot from that perspective. But nonetheless, the pipeline of possibles continues to be, I think, pretty full. And so we're actively looking at things as we sit here today.\nTim Moore: Great. Well, thanks, Joe and Kerry. And that's it for my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back to Joe Bergera for pre-submitted investor questions.\nJoe Bergera: Super. Thank you, operator. Yes, I'd like to address two questions, sort of, that we received prior to today's call. The first question from an investor was, what steps Iteris taking to assure and show meaningful progress towards achieving the company's vision 2027 target of 16% to 19% adjusted EBITDA margins? And in response to that question, I want to reconfirm that management, we are extremely focused on delivering EBITDA margins and improvements. And of course, we just announced that our nine-month adjusted EBITDA represents an $18.1 million improvement year-over-year. As we looked 2027, we're pursuing many initiatives to expand our adjusted EBITDA margins. But I want to share some specific color on four drivers that in our opinion represent meaningful levers for adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Some of these we've already talked to in response to some of the analyst questions. But first, one area for improvement is related to cloud infrastructure and data acquisition costs for our software as a service and data as a service solution. As I noted just a moment ago, those costs are largely fixed, resulting in gross margins that are currently suboptimal because we've got the fixed costs on relatively low revenue. But as that revenue steps up, every million dollars would expect to realize significant cost leverage and associated margin expansion, which will flow through and you'll begin to see in the income statement. Second, as we mentioned on various calls, including today's, and even just a couple seconds ago, our current project-based services gross margin, our consulting gross margin has been depressed by the fact that our internal labor capacity is not at the level that we'd like. We're continuing to make progress on that, and that's going to bear some fruit, obviously not to the same degree as we'll see with respect to the SaaS and DaaS solutions for the reasons I mentioned. But then the third driver that I did want to also note we previously talked about, we didn't discuss yet on this call, is that, our Vantage Apex product, which is our newest sensor product line, is still relatively new, and the volume on it is relatively low. And that's because it takes agencies time to review and qualify these new products before they can be installed within their respective jurisdiction. And as the volume of the Apex shipments continues to climb, we'll realize various internal efficiencies and begin to capture better volume pricing for certain electronics components that we only use on our Vantage Apex's product line. And then there are also process benefits that we'll realize with respect to assembly, test, and shipping of that product line. And then, fourthly, just broadly, an increase in revenue from various other service and product lines will, of course, improve our overhead absorption and yield operating expense leverage. So, all four of those factors are going to drive significant improvements in EBITDA margins through the 2027 horizon. I'm not going to go into all the specific actions that we're taking to improve our adjusted EBITDA margins, but I do hope that that'll give you a view of some of the structural dynamics that we expect to benefit us over the next couple of years. The second question, as I said, I'm going to kind of address that was, you know, can you provide some general comments on Iteris's thinking on M&A, especially given Iteris has a clean balance sheet. And I feel that, we kind of address that in responding to Tim's question, so I'm not going to belabor that. Anyway, having addressed those two investor questions, and I do want to provide some brief comments about our overall investor relations program. So on that front, before we wrap up, I wanted to just make sure everyone knows that we'll be engaged in various investor outreach activities over the next few months. For example, we will participate in a fireside chat hosted by SumZero on February 14, 2024. Thank you, SumZero, for inviting us. If you're a member of the SumZero community, we hope that you will attend. And then on March 14, we'll be traveling to New York City for a non-deal roadshow hosted by B. Riley. And on March 2024, we'll participate in a fireside chat hosted by EF Hutton. And if any of you would like to join us in either of those venues, please contact your B. Riley or EF Hutton representative. And then on May 15, 2024, we'll participate in the EF Hutton Annual Global Conference in New York City. And on May 22, and 23, 2024, we'll participate in the B. Riley 24th Annual Institutional Investor Conference in Beverly Hills. And obviously, if you plan to attend either of those conferences, we hope you'll schedule time to meet with us. We'd love the opportunity to talk to you in person. So anyway, one other thing I wanted to share with you if you didn't already see it, is that on January 10, 2024, we published a white paper on the use of AI and transportation. And if you'd like a copy of that white paper, you don't already have it. It's available for download from our investor site, or you can also contact Todd Kehrli at Todd@mkir.com for a copy. So anyway, with that, I wanted to just say that we're always available to speak with investors if you do have any follow-up questions after today's call? And if not, we look forward to updating you again on our continued progress when we report our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and our full year results. So with that, we'll conclude today's call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Iteris Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Todd Kehrli of MKR Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nTodd Kehrli: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss Iteris' financial results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter ending on September 30, 2023. Joining us today are Iteris' President and CEO, Mr. Joe Bergera; and the company's CFO, Mr. Kerry Shiba. Following their remarks, we'll open the call for questions from the company's covering sell-side analysts. Then we will answer investor questions that were submitted to the company in advance of the call, per the instructions in our press release dated October 26, 2023. Before we continue, we'd like to remind all participants that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events of the future performance of the company, which statements are based on current information, are subject to change and are not guarantees of future performance. Iteris is not undertaking an obligation to provide updates to these forward-looking statements in the future. Actual results may differ substantially from what is discussed today, and no one should assume that at a later date, the company's comments from today will still be valid. Iteris refers you to the documents that the company files from time to time with the SEC, specifically the company's most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, which contain and identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that are contained in any of the forward-looking statements. As always, you'll find a webcast replay of today's call on the Investors section of the company's website at www.iteris.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Iteris' President and CEO, Mr. Joe Bergera. Joe, please proceed.\nJoe Bergera: Great. Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon to everyone. I appreciate all of you joining us today. Iteris reported record fiscal 2024 second quarter total revenue of $43.6 million and fiscal 2024 first half total revenue of $87.1 million, representing an increase of 11% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. We attribute the strong rate of growth to a high level of demand for our products and services, and we also benefited from a handful of large consulting projects, which were previously delayed due to dependencies on subcontractor deliverables, achieving key revenue milestones in our second quarter and our first half. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter gross margins increased 2,060 basis points, and our fiscal 2024 first half gross margins increased 1,510 basis points on a year-over-year basis, respectively. The gross margin improvement further demonstrates that our supply chain issues are behind us. Due to significant gross margin improvement and our continued focus on operating efficiency, we reported fiscal 2024 second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million and first half adjusted EBITDA of $6.9 million, representing an $8.1 million and $14.6 million improvement year-over-year, respectively. In a few minutes, Kerry will address our profitability dynamics in more detail. Customer adoption of the ClearMobility Platform remains very strong. We reported fiscal 2024 second quarter total net bookings of $43.8 million and first half total net bookings of $96.9 million, representing an increase of 4% and 14% year-over-year, respectively. Due to our strong bookings results, we ended that September 30, 2023 period with a record total ending backlog of $124 million, representing an 11% increase year-over-year. As always, our ending backlog and our net bookings figures reflect firm customer orders rather than total contract value. The total value of customer contracts, which will vary from quarter-to-quarter, averages on a historical basis about 200% of our total ending backlog. At this point, I'd like to share some details about the performance of our product portfolio. For our sensors and third-party hardware, which we refer to collectively as products, we reported fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue of $23.4 million and first half revenue of $47.1 million, representing a 13% and 27% increase year-over-year, respectively. When compared to a 6% to 8% average historical growth rate for the related market categories, our sensors continue to take significant market share, growing more than 3x the average market rate of growth. The strong rate of growth is due both to continued solid commercial execution and also the superior product features and performance. Indeed, in the fiscal 2024 second quarter and first half, our product teams continue to make solid progress against key business priorities. These priorities include winning a disproportionate share of large-scale modernization initiatives, leveraging our leadership in intersection detection to penetrate adjacent categories, including the emerging cellular vehicle to everything or CV2X category, and attaching annual recurring revenue to our Vantage and our Spectra connected vehicle sensors. For example, some fiscal 2024 second quarter notable customer commitments include: a new master purchase agreement with Maricopa County in Arizona, which is the fourth most populous county in the nation, to use our Vantage Next detection system, our [Bluetooth] travel time sensors and our Vantage Live and ClearGuide signal software for a multiyear comprehensive arterial modernization initiative, which will be executed over the next several years; a new purchase agreement with the City of Cedar Park, Texas to deploy our Vantage Apex detection system, connected vehicle sensors and Vantage Live and ClearGuide signal software for a comprehensive citywide intersection modernization initiative; a purchase order for our Vantage Apex detection system and Vantage Live software from the Coachella Valley Association of Governments in California for the second phase of a region-wide intersection modernization initiative. You may recall me speaking about the first phase award recently. A purchase order from Richardson, Texas for the second phase of a citywide deployment of our Vantage Apex system, and purchase orders from the New York State Department of Transportation for the first deployments in districts one and two of our [VantageRadius Plus] detection system. As a reminder, the State of New York represents a new geographic market for Iteris, as our VantageRadius product was first added to the state's qualified product list only last year. Now I want to review the performance of our services portfolio, which includes our various consulting services, managed services, Software as a Service and Data as a Service offers. We reported record fiscal 2024 second quarter service revenue of $20.2 million and first half service revenue of $40.1 million, representing a 9% and 12% increase year-over-year, respectively. As noted earlier, our strong service revenue growth is attributable largely to strong customer demand, with some timing benefit from a couple of large consulting projects with subcontractor dependencies that finally achieved revenue recognition milestones. During our fiscal 2024 second quarter and first half, we continue to make progress on initiatives to improve our internal consulting labor capacity. We also improved our labor utilization, increasing average revenue per headcount. While the pace of improvement remains difficult to predict, we expect the growth in labor capacity to contribute to revenue growth while also improving our labor mix and our gross margins in the future. As with our product portfolio, the level of demand for our services portfolio remains very strong. We reported net service bookings in our fiscal 2024 second quarter of $22.8 million and first half of $57.1 million, representing an 8% and a 32% increase year-over-year, respectively. In the second quarter alone, we recorded the following notable service bookings: a new $9.5 million contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation to drive the development of the nation's architecture reference for cooperative and intelligent transportation, including the definition of standards for infrastructure to vehicle communication and for vehicle electrification; the $2.2 million task order to provide integrated corridor management services for District 5 or the Florida Department of Transportation; a $1 million-plus Data as a Service and data analytics agreement with Ventura County in California; more than $1 million in Software as a Service agreements with various state and local agencies for the use of our ClearGuide software; and a new consulting agreement to develop a North American Intelligent Transportation Systems market assessment for a confidential global automotive OEM. These bookings illustrate the unique ability of our ecosystem to not only enable collaboration among mobility infrastructure owner operators, or in other words, various public agencies, but between mobility infrastructure owner operators and mobility infrastructure users, including the traveling public and various commercial entities. To sustain strong customer adoption of our ClearMobility platform, we continue to introduce important new solutions and feature enhancements. For example, in our fiscal 2024 second quarter and first half, we released the Alpha version of a next-generation travel time and connected vehicle data collection and presentation system, as well as new transit signal prioritization features and ClearGuide signals. In summary, we're very pleased with our fiscal 2024 second quarter and our first half revenue, adjusted EBITDA, net bookings and ending backlog. Additionally, we continue to make significant progress evolving to a platform-based business model, which will enhance solution repeatability, collaboration, scalability and growth. Due to the very high degree of fragmentation and complexity in our end market, we continue to believe the progress of our platform strategy will bolster our position as a superior source of value in this industry. On that note, I'll pass the mic to Kerry to provide more color on our fiscal 2024 second quarter and first half financial results, after which I'll come back to further discuss our expectations for the third quarter and for the full year.\nKerry Shiba: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon or evening, everyone. Because Joe already has described our exciting commercial progress in some detail, I only want to underscore that our strength in the market continues to be demonstrated by double-digit revenue growth and a record backlog fed by strong bookings. Also, as I noted last quarter, I want to remind you that when you view our progress compared to last year, the shape of our fiscal 2023 revenue curve was especially impacted by supply chain shortages occurring in the first half of that year, which resulted in a back-end loading of revenues. This anomaly was especially evident in our first quarter year-to-year comparisons, but also was evident when looking at first half results. In fiscal 2023, a only about 47% of total year revenue occurred in the first half, with 53% occurring in the second half. Normally, our revenue is split roughly 50-50 between the two halves. The prior year also did not exhibit typical seasonality, where a usual sequential design - I'm sorry, decline in the third quarter revenue did not occur in fiscal 2023. And Joe will address this point again later when he discusses guidance. Moving down the income statement to the gross profit line. I would like to expand some on the  commentary Joe provided. As Joe noted, the impact of supply chain dynamics was reflected in our gross profit performance last fiscal year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expensed about $7.8 million of negative purchase price variance from aftermarket purchases of semiconductors and other electronics components, which by far was the largest negative quarterly impact last year and was $7.6 million worse than for the same quarter this year. Just to reiterate what Joe said, the negative cost and operational impacts of the fiscal 2023 supply chain issues are now behind us. From a year-over-year perspective, fiscal 2024 second quarter consolidated gross profit increased $9.7 million, which is 148% higher than in the prior year. Products gross profit improved by 1,253%, with approximately 80% of the improvement driven by supply chain improvement and the remainder reflective of higher volume. Services gross profit improved 2.8% overall, increasing about $200,000 due to higher revenue. Looking at gross margins. The second quarter of this year improved 2,060 basis points in the aggregate, reaching 37.3% in total. The increase was driven by a 4,040 basis point improvement for products, which more than offset a 180 basis point decline for services. Products gross margin reached 44.1% for the current year second quarter. And with last year's negative cost impact from supply chain issues clearly behind us, ongoing fluctuations would be expected to reflect changes in product mix. Gross margin for services was 29.5% for the second quarter of this year, with the decline resulting primarily from a higher subcontractor labor mix than experienced in the same prior year period. Operating expenses in aggregate were 17.2% higher in the current year's second quarter when compared to the same period last year and 200 basis points higher measured as a percentage of revenue. In general, prior year cost levels reflect very tight spending controls imposed in the midst of the supply chain crisis. The current year increase was most significant in the G&A category, with 44% of the G&A increase due to litigation costs for a contract dispute with a competitor, which is trying to relitigate some particular terms of a settlement agreement executed between the two companies nearly nine years ago. In addition to the litigation costs, we experienced a temporary increase in contractor expenses and some adjustments to equity compensation costs. Increased revenues were the primary driver for higher sales and marketing costs, while we also increased investment in R&D for software development. The factors just discussed related to revenue, gross profit and operating expense, fundamentally explain the major comparison in operating income, net income and adjusted EBITDA. As Joe mentioned, adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 million for the second quarter, an improvement of $8.1 million when compared to the prior - the same period last year. This brings adjusted EBITDA to $6.9 million for the first half of fiscal 2024, a turnaround of $14.6 million over last year. Total cash at the end of the second quarter this year was $20.2 million, which was $12.2 million above the balance at the same time last year and slightly higher than the balance at the end of last quarter, which was right at $20 million. Cash flow for this year's second quarter included $3.8 million in payments for annual performance bonuses normally paid out in the fiscal second quarter and a $1 million payment to a prime contractor for a product return that we discussed initially in the last quarter's Form 10-Q. The improvement from last year continues to reflect a combination of higher income and strong balance sheet management. While cash trajectory can always be affected in the short term around balance sheet cutoffs, future earnings improvement and good balance sheet management provide the foundation for continued liquidity improvement going forward. With that, I now will turn the call back over to Joe, who will discuss our fiscal 2024 guidance update and then provide some closing comments.\nJoe Bergera: Great. Thank you, Kerry. The smart mobility infrastructure management market represents a significant long-term opportunity due to the historic federal funding that's been committed by Congress through 2026, as well as positive technology trends that include the adoption of cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence and connected and autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the market is characterized by high switching costs and customer stickiness, benefiting established companies with a broad portfolio of superior products and services. Therefore, given the breadth of our platform capabilities, significant brand equity and extensive customer reach, we remain extremely optimistic about the long-term opportunity in front of Iteris. Over the balance of fiscal 2024, Iteris will continue to deliver against an aggressive solutions road map that includes the following major releases: a next-generation connected vehicle data collection and data presentation system that includes a suite of connected vehicle applications powered by ClearMobility cloud APIs; a state-of-the-industry cloud-based international registration planning and international fuel tax administration system for commercial vehicles, which in addition to significant benefits for fleet operators and public agencies, will capture valuable new data sets for our ClearMobility Cloud; the introduction of Vantage Fusion features in our Vantage Apex sensor line, which will streamline our sensor portfolio and accelerate our connected vehicle strategy; and the application of additional artificial intelligence at the edge and in our cloud that will enhance our ability to identify, verify and predict certain transportation events. We expect our fiscal 2024 release plan to drive further adoption of the ClearMobility Platform, increase our wallet share among existing customers and improve the monetization of our expanding mobility data sets. Among other benefits, these dynamics should support an above-market rate of growth in our total bookings as well as continue to increase the average size of individual bookings. In addition to focusing on our solutions portfolio, we'll continue to pursue key operational priorities, including the productivity of our distributor network, the maturity of our customer success function and internal labor capacity of our consulting teams. As a reminder, the tactics outlined on our prior earnings call have already produced a measurable improvement year-to-date in our internal labor capacity. Before I address our guidance, I want to emphasize two important dynamics. And also which build on some of the points that Kerry has made. First, our prior year's revenue curve did not reflect normal seasonality since supply chain constraints in the fiscal 2023 first half pushed some product shipments into the second half, making our second half year-over-year comparisons tougher than normal. Second, some service revenue that was anticipated to occur in the fiscal 2024 second half moved forward into our first quarter of this year. And additionally, we're applying a degree of conservatism to our guidance due to some temporary federal budget uncertainty, but is unlikely to change long-range funding levels but certainly could cause some near-term delays. With this context, we're providing guidance for fiscal 2024 third quarter total revenue in the range of $41 million to $43 million, representing growth of 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. We're also providing guidance for third quarter adjusted EBITDA in the range of 4% to 6%, which continues to represent a significant year-over-year improvement and reflects normal seasonality, product mix and related revenue expectations. With respect to our fiscal 2024 full year revenue, we're raising the low end of our revenue range by $3 million, bringing our new range to $171 million to $175 million, which represents organic growth of 11% at the midpoint. We're maintaining our guidance for an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 7% to 9% of fiscal 2024 revenue as well as our fiscal 2024 net cash flow guidance in the range of $12 million to $16 million. Looking beyond fiscal 2024, we believe Iteris remains on track to achieve our Vision 2027 target. In other words, we continue to estimate fiscal 2027 revenue in the range of $245 million to $265 million before any additional acquisitions, representing a 5-year organic revenue CAGR of 14% at the midpoint. With a substantial increase in annual revenue, we anticipate progressive benefits from scale to result in fiscal 2027 adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 16% to 19%. Additionally, we anticipate improvements in our liquidity will enable Iteris to resume our acquisition program, which would be additive to our organic Vision 2027 targets. With that, we would be delighted to respond to any questions and comments. Operator, could you open up the line for that, please?\nOperator: Yes, indeed. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Your line is live.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Yes, hi everyone. Joe, maybe we could just circle back to the federal budget uncertainty? And I guess, how are you seeing that manifest in your business and customer activity or customer bookings and when projects actually start or continue?\nJoe Bergera: Sure. So to be clear, as we said, overall, the environment remains really strong, and we're extremely bullish about our marketplace. But I will say that in the second quarter, in anticipation of a federal government shutdown, we did see some delays in some task order execution. And as a result, some projects did slip to the right. In light of the fact that we've yet to reach an agreement regarding the annual budget and it's unclear whether there will be - or exactly what the nature of a continuing resolution might look like to extend funding, we would anticipate that, again, the Biden administration will advise federal agencies to begin to slow down processing certain activities in order to conserve budget. And so that's likely to result in a couple of things, as we experienced in the second half, slowing down and probably shifting to the right. But again, Congress has already approved the IIJA, which allows for funding over a 5-year period. And as a result of that and then strong revenue collection at the state and local level, we remain overall really positive about our environment, but we would expect that there could be some slowdowns, which at the margin could have a slight negative effect in the second quarter - I'm sorry, in the third quarter, I apologize.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Okay. That's helpful. And then I mean, hopefully, we're through that as we get into the fourth quarter. Knock on wood. So I guess my question would be - and I know you gave guidance for the year, but just sort of thinking about growth reacceleration, what you feel needs to happen for that to manifest other than what we just talked about as far as the federal budget?\nJoe Bergera: Yes. So again, for the year, based on our current guidance at the midpoint, we're anticipating 11% growth. And as I said, through 2027, we're anticipating an average rate of growth of about 14%, again, at the midpoint of our Vision 2027 target. Now that clearly hasn't changed. What is impacting the comparisons - if you look at the rate of growth in the first half of this year to the second half of this year, I'm talking about year-over-year comparisons, it's the unusual prior year comps, right? And so I want to, first of all, just make very clear that we are not anticipating any kind of deceleration in the second half. Although if you look at the year-over-year rate of growth, it's not going to be as strong. But again, that was due to the unusual prior year revenue curve. But looking ahead, again, we think the market is going to remain extremely robust. We continue to make what we think are smart investments in building out our ClearMobility Platform, which has already met with really strong market acceptance, and we'd expect that to continue and even accelerate with some of the new capabilities that we're launching. And we also continue to think that we have by far the most productive sales force or sales channel in the marketplace. So absent any like particularly unusual externality, we think we really just need to execute in order to continue to grow at the rate that we have over the last couple of years and the rates that we're projecting through 2027.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Okay. And then you just mentioned product capabilities. So maybe we can touch on that for a second. The new sensors that you have and that you're developing, maybe you can just speak to the capabilities there.\nJoe Bergera: Yes, sure. So one major focus for us across really all of our products, both our sensors and our software, is an increasing focus on safety. And there are a variety of things that we're doing. But at some level, a lot of it is exploiting the capabilities of artificial intelligence. And again, we're using that both at the edge and our sensors as well as in the cloud. And so that's something we're going to be talking about a lot. And then additionally, something that we also discussed and we remain focused positioning the company to capitalize on the increasing availability of connected vehicles and also over the longer-term horizon, the expectation that the increasing levels of autonomy will become increasingly prevalent. And that creates an opportunity and, frankly, a need for infrastructure to vehicle communication. And because of our position in the infrastructure already, we think we're in a really unique position to be able to capitalize on that. So again, safety generally and connected autonomous vehicle activity broadly are two important themes for both our software and our sensors road map. And we'll be talking more about some of the specific capabilities that we'll be enabling with respect to both of those themes as we launch some of the products that I referred to in my script.\nJeff Van Sinderen: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll take the rest offline.\nJoe Bergera: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, good evening guys. This is [Matthew Robb] on for Ryan. I got a question on the gross margin. Just on the product side. It's a little weaker quarter-over-quarter, nicely improved on the service side, but how do we think about gross margin for the rest of the year?\nJoe Bergera: Kerry, do you want to talk to that?\nKerry Shiba: Sure. I think that the slight downtick in the second quarter sequentially was again basically product mix-driven. And I think we still may see some fluctuation going forward. I don't think the second quarter is exhibiting anything that is unexpected or unusual. And I think it's a fair baseline going forward. A couple of things hitting the mix that happened episodically would be certainly the amount of third-party products that go through the system. We tend to be, oftentimes, contractually in an intersection kind of integrator positions. So we buy and sell certain products that we don't manufacture, and those have a very, very small, if any, markup on them. And then secondarily, we are introducing a new line of our sensors, our Apex sensors. And they're still at relatively low volumes, so we still have not achieved the economy of scale that we would expect to see in the medium and longer term. So depending on how the mix goes between some of our sensor products, some of our in-line higher-value products and then these third-party items, it will get affected. Not going to be big changes quarter-to-quarter as a result of that, but some relatively small fluctuations will occur.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the labor capacity side, I know last quarter, you guys talked about kind of exiting the year closer to that mid-teens growth in capacity. Is that still kind of the target that we're looking at? Or is there kind of more subcontractor issue going on? I know you guys called that out in the call, too. So...\nJoe Bergera: Yes, for sure. So the labor market continues to be tight, particularly for highly technical transportation-related disciplines. And so we continue to put a lot of energy against it. As I mentioned, on a year-to-date basis, we actually saw a pretty nice increase in our labor capacity, which probably got us about 1/3 of the way to where we need. So I'd say that we're more or less on track against the original expectation. But to be clear, there is more work that needs to be done in the second half. And while overall, probably labor market conditions are probably a little bit easier than maybe they were a year ago, I can't say the same thing about the transportation market and some of these very specific technical disciplines. It does remain tight, and it's something that we'll remain focused on. But I would say that we're not overly concerned. I think we feel good about the plan that we outlined. And I think we're making progress against that plan more or less as we had expected.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Latimore with Northland. Your line is live.\nAditya Dagaonkar: Hi. This is Aditya on behalf of Mike Latimore. Would you give some color on what percentage of your revenue and bookings were recurring?\nJoe Bergera: Yes. Kerry, do you want to talk to that?\nKerry Shiba: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question again?\nJoe Bergera: What percent of revenue and bookings was recurring?\nKerry Shiba: Let's see. On a recurring revenue basis, we ended up at roughly about 25%. We're growing our recurring revenues nominally, but as a percentage of total, the very, very high growth rate we've been seeing in products tends to mask that when you look at it from that - from a percent of revenues overall.\nJoe Bergera: And then also, bookings were - I believe that recurring bookings growth was I think, in the high 20%, maybe the low 30% for the quarter. But as a reminder, they were exceptionally high. I think it was like 65% to 70% growth in the first quarter. So overall, for the first half, I believe that our - the bookings for recurring revenue was well above the current 25% of total revenue, meaning that we are on track to continue to increase the contribution of recurring revenue to total revenue through 2027.\nAditya Dagaonkar: Got it. Any color on the pipeline growth?\nJoe Bergera: Yes. The overall, the sales pipeline, yes, so the demand environment remains extremely strong. And as I've said before, we think that market interest, market adoption of ClearMobility Platform is consistent with our original expectations, perhaps even exceeding that. So when we look at our overall pipeline, it continues to grow, remains overall extremely healthy. Our win rates remain exceptionally high. I would say that they're probably best in class in our industry. All that being said, as I've said before, as we continue to pursue more and more large transactions, that does make us more susceptible to the impacts of timing on any one or two of those big transactions. The first quarter was a perfect example for us, where we had a couple of extremely large transactions that closed in that period and we had historic bookings growth. In the second quarter, we again had very strong bookings growth, but we actually pulled some bookings that we had anticipated to occur in the second quarter into the first. And as a result, the rate of bookings growth in the second quarter was lower than it was in the first. But I think you should expect, overall, there will continue to be some degree of lumpiness, especially as we continue to pursue more and more of these large transactions. But again, on a medium-term to long-term basis, we feel very, very confident about our continued bookings growth being in excess of overall market growth rates. And of course, that will drive continued backlog growth and ultimately, superior revenue growth in our market.\nAditya Dagaonkar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tim Moore with E.F. Hutton. Your line is live.\nTim Moore: Thanks, and congratulations on the top line, beat both products and service sales and the strong half of the year. I mean, a lot of companies, not just you, are facing a difficult lapping period of comps in the next six months. So you're not an only boat. And I just want to follow up first maybe on a thread from a prior question. Maybe another one for Kerry. From an operational perspective, - when you start - now that you're pretty much done with the supply chain constraints and really not much of a headwind anymore. You've got the in-house circuit boards. And eventually, the subcontractors' usage margin drag is be mostly maybe minimalized as you finish this internal hiring expansion and training. So I know you're not giving next year guidance, but do you think a 40% gross margin is not an unrealistic stretch goal when you kind of look out to next summer or June quarter, September quarter after you lapped a tough comp?\nKerry Shiba: Yes. Tim, I think, certainly, we'll continue to see progression. And for basically, the factors that you mentioned, first off, obviously, the - when you think about the EBITDA margin progression, the continued revenue growth is going to help us get better leverage on OpEx, number one. Number two, we're continuing to work in our manufacturing and supply chain area to improve our leverage in that area also. And I do think that there are some things that are in the works operationally, which should contribute to improvement in margin progressively on the sensor side of our business. And then as we continue to, I think, improve our labor mix, obviously, that's going to that's going to point to a positive also. So I think that there's wind in the sails clearly directionally with respect to what we would see going forward.\nTim Moore: Good. That's helpful color. I appreciate it, Kerry. And maybe for Joe, I mean, how would you kind of rate your internal labor hiring and less need for more expensive subcontractors when you kind of get to January or February? Are you - do you think by then, you'll be 65%, 2/3 of the way accomplished?\nJoe Bergera: Yes, I would expect that at that point. We've actually begun to see like a higher level of impact, if you will, from the initiatives that we began to introduce in the first quarter because as you would expect, there's some kind of a lag effect. And so yes, it would be my expectation that we'd be about 2/3 of the way there by January. And this is, of course, just to be clear, it's something we're going to have to continue to focus on going forward. We'd expect for the foreseeable future that the labor markets will remain relatively tight. But I don't - I want to make sure this is not lost on people. Iteris has a fantastic employee brand reputation. And so as we make an effort to engage with more candidates and basically extend our funnel, we're finding really, really strong interest by those candidates in working with Iteris. And again, I want to make sure everyone understands that we have probably unusually high attrition rates, generally speaking, and certainly within our industry, especially given what a tight labor market it is. So once we get people here, we keep them around because we've been doing a lot of exciting things, and a lot of employees want to be part of our story.\nTim Moore: That's really helpful color. Next question I have is you - if you and Kerry kind of think back and maybe - I've been watching the contract wins and recording them. In the last nine months or so, it's been very good, even the last 12 months. I think a topic investors are really curious about is when you reached that scale, maybe that $10 million more of recurring revenue you need from cloud-based solutions or process virtualization to really get the gross margin step up given that I think Software as a Service side is at least 65% gross margin. So do you think you can maybe get to that kind of inflection point? Maybe December next year, you may be still on track for that?\nJoe Bergera: Well, I'll offer some comments and then Kerry, I'd like you to chime in. Tim, to be totally transparent, we will continue to make progress between now and next December. And I think it will be notable. I think it will flow through the financial statements. So you guys will be able to see the progress that we're making. But I'm not sure whether we will hit that critical inflection point as early as next December. I think it's more likely to be in the beginning of the subsequent fiscal year, which would be the first half of that subsequent fiscal year. So I'd say sometime probably between April and September of the following year.\nKerry Shiba: I don't think I have anything to add to that or any more color to add to that, Tim.\nJoe Bergera: I do want to make sure, Tim, though, you understand, I don't want people to think like, well, you're not going to see any benefit, then until you get there, which is not the case. You will continue to see step improvements along the way.\nTim Moore: No, no. I totally get it. That's something we talked about. And yes, it's just another step on the ladder if you're seeing incremental gross margin improvement and then maybe a little bit more of a hockey stick push then. And then lastly, for you and Kerry, I mean, any update on the tuck-in acquisition appetite? Your funnel is asking valuations of targets have become more reasonable over the last few months?\nJoe Bergera: Kerry, do you want to take a crack at that?\nKerry Shiba: Well, yes, I'm not sure if there's anything new to report right now. Tim, obviously, we're in a position from a liquidity perspective where we can start to actively search again. We are still in the process of trying to find candidates that are a good fit for - for all the things that anybody looks for in acquisition, technology, culture, fit cost leverage. But as you know, we want to be careful because we want our acquisitions to be accretive. We have not had discussions as of late that would indicate that the valuation expectations have significantly changed from, I think, the last time we talked. But I would expect that to continue to start to exhibit itself, but I think there's probably still a little bit more lag in I guess the reality - wake up in the - from the sell side with these smaller companies. So I think we remain on the - with the same focus and the same expectations overall. But I would just reiterate that we're going to be careful not to overpay also.\nJoe Bergera: And Tim, I guess the one thing that I would add to that is that we - I think it's probably accurate to say that we are seeing more interest from like sort of a certain profile of potential targets who are beginning to exhibit like more realistic expectations. But as you might expect, some of those companies that kind of reached that point are not necessarily the most attractive targets. Those companies that are in a stronger financial position and, therefore, able to kind of wait it out are probably the ones we're more interested in. So there's a little bit of like some tug and pull going on there. But to Kerry's point, I think that we certainly continue to expand our funnel and to have increasingly more substantive conversations with various targets. So I do believe that we're going to get there probably before too terribly long. But I do want to just be really clear about the fact that the opportunities that are arguably more actionable right now are not necessarily those that would be of greatest interest to us.\nTim Moore: That makes sense. I'm starting to hear that across the industry. So thanks a lot, Joe and Kerry, thanks for those insights. That's it for my questions.\nJoe Bergera: Great. Thanks, Tim.\nKerry Shiba: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Mr. Bergera, there are no more questions from covering analysts. Would you like to answer any investor questions before making your closing remarks?\nJoe Bergera: Yes. Thank you. I would like to do that. We actually have two investor questions that I wanted to answer, and then I will make some very brief closing remarks. So the first question from investors, whether Iteris has seen an increase in the number or the size of sales opportunities since formula funding has begun to flow to state and local agencies. And the answer is that, in general, we have started to see an increase in state and local transportation infrastructure budgets due to the IIJA formula funding that did start flowing into the system over the last four quarters. In turn, that's resulted in an overall increase in the number and size of opportunities in our sales pipeline, which is consistent with some of the questions that we just discussed. That said, however, the labor market remains really tight. And that's not just impacting us. It's also impacting many agencies that have not been able to add the internal resources necessary for them to program and then disperse the entire increase in the funding. So as a result, we've seen contract awards sort of come in waves rather than a steady flow. And due to the delay agencies are experiencing and dispensing IIJA funding, it's not really our expectation that there's going to be a pretty long tail as state and local agencies continue to deploy IIJA funding even beyond the last 5-year statutory length, right? So to be clear, they're going to be able to disperse money or transfer money to state and local agencies, but formula funding is nonspecific. It's highly fungible. And so state and local agencies will be able to continue to spend that after the term of the [IIJANs]. And we're - that is our expectation that that's going to occur because there has been some difficulty that we've seen by certain agencies in order to push all these funds through the system as fast as they otherwise would have liked to do. So the second question is whether Iteris could provide an update on the development of Safe Streets For All initiatives. And so for those of you who don't know, the Safe Streets For All or also call it, SS4A grant program supports the U.S. DoT's National Roadway Safety Strategy, and that strategy is a goal of zero deaths and zero injuries on our nation's roadways. U.S. DoT has defined two types of SS4A grants. One type of grant is referred to as action or planning grants. And the other type of grant is referred to as implementation grants. U.S. DoT has announced the first tranche of SS4A grants in the first quarter of calendar year 2022. And the initial tranche included 474 action or planning grants for a sum total of $212 million, which represents an average grant size of $447,000. And then arguably more importantly, it included 37 implementation grants for a sum total of $519 million, representing an average grant size of $14 million. Obviously, the implementation grants are substantially larger than the planning grants. After reviewing the details of the initial awards because now that they're out there in the public domain, we're talking to agencies about these grants. Iteris has determined that about 70% of the implementation grants focused on improvement to physical infrastructure, meaning that about 30% of the money that was awarded is going to be used for advanced technology to improve safety. So as we noted in our IIJA white paper published in September, it can take 12 to 24 months from U.S. DoT's notice of a grant award for an action or planning grant before a local agency receives the federal funding and then issues the task order to a contractor. And it can take even longer, 24 to 36 months before a local agency will be able to issue a task order under an implementation grant. And that's due to the fact that because of the nature of the work, there's some additional programming requirements that need to be executed. So anyway, as discussed in our white paper, contractors who perform work under an action or a planning task order may be precluded from performing work under an associated implementation task order. So in general, it's not always the case, but in general, Iteris prioritizes task orders related to implementation grants over task orders related to actual planning grants because implementation grants are larger, and we don't want to be precluded from pursuing those. So anyway, although we're very early in this process with local agencies just beginning to issue assets for a task orders, I can say that Iteris has already executed two action grant task orders and been awarded an additional four task orders that are pending final contract execution. And then additionally, as I mentioned, 30% of all the implementation grant funding went to technology. Iteris has already been specified on four of those implementation grants, and the total value - the sum total of those grants is $75 million. And that represents 48% of the total technology funding for all the SS4A implementation grants awarded in the first tranche of such grants. And that is those grants that had a focus on technology as opposed to physical infrastructure. So anyway, we feel like we're doing extremely well with these SS4A grants. And we expect to continue to receive more task orders from SS4A and from other grant programs as competitive grant funding is finally beginning to move through the system. So anyway, having addressed those two investor questions - and I hope we've done so fully and completely - I did want to offer a couple of closing remarks. And specifically, I wanted to mention that in addition to the infrastructure investment and Jobs Act white paper, which we published recently, we've also published a recent update to our annual environment, social and governance presentation. And both of those documents are available on our investor site. Additionally, we're going to be participating in an artificial intelligence virtual conference hosted by Northland Securities on December 14 and 15. And if you're interested in attending, we hope you'll contact Northland Security. I'm sure they would be delighted to have you join. And in the meantime, I want to say that we look forward to updating all of you again on our continued progress when we report our fiscal 2024 third quarter results. And so with that, we're going to conclude today's call. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Iteris's Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Todd Kehrli of MKR Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTodd Kehrli : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss Iteris's financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended June 30, 2023.  Joining us today, are Iteris's President and CEO Mr. Joe Bergera, and the company's CFO, Mr. Kerry Shiba. Following the remarks, we'll open the call for questions from the companies covering sell-side analysts. Then we will answer investor questions that were submitted to the company in advance of the call for the instructions in our press release dated July 25, 2023.  Before we continue, we'd like to remind all participants that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future performance of the company, which statements are based on current information are subject to change and are not guarantees of future performance. Iteris does not undertaking an obligation to provide update to these forward-looking statements in the future. Actual results may differ substantially from what is discussed today, and no one should assume that at a later date, the company's comments from today will still be valid. Iteris refers you to the documents of the company files from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically the company's most recent Forms 10-k 10-Q and 8-K, which contain and identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that are contained in any forward-looking statements.  As always, you'll find a webcast replay of today's call on the Investor section of the company's website www.iteris.com.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Iteris's President and CEO, Mr. Joe Bergera Sir, please proceed.\nJoe Bergera : Great. Thank you, Todd. And good afternoon to everyone. I appreciate all of you joining us today.  Iteris reported record total revenue of $43.5 million in our fiscal 2024 first quarter, representing an increase of 29% year-over-year. We attributed the strong rate of growth to a high level of demand for our products and services. And we also had some consulting projects which had been delayed due to dependencies on subcontractor deliverables achieved key revenue milestones. As of our last earnings call, we were not expecting these subcontractors to be able to achieve these revenue milestones until our fiscal 2024 second half.  Our fiscal 2024 first quarter gross margins rose 840 basis points on a year-over-year basis and 680 basis points on a sequential basis, demonstrating that the high purchase price variance associated with our prior supply chain issues are now behind us. As a result of the gross margin improvement and our continued focus on operating efficiency, we reported record adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million, representing a $6.1 million improvement year-over-year. In a few minutes, Kerry will address our profitability dynamics in more detail.  Customer adoption of the ClearMobility platform remains very strong. In our fiscal 2024 first quarter, we reported record total net bookings of $53.1 million representing an increase of 25% year-over-year. Due to strong bookings results, we ended the June 30, 2023 period, with a record total ending backlog of $123.8 million, representing a 14% increase year-over-year. As always, our ending backlog and net bookings figures reflect firm customer orders rather than total contract value. The total contract value, which varies from quarter-to-quarter, averages on an historical basis about 200% of our total ending backlog.  Also keep in mind that our backlog excludes a portion, which varies from period-to-period of our sensor bookings since these orders often convert to shipments within a single quarter.  At this point, I'd like to share some details about the performance of our product portfolio. For our sensors and third-party hardware, which are referred to collectively as products, we reported fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue of $23.7 million, representing 44% increase year-over-year. The strong year-over-year comparison is due both to continued solid commercial execution and a relatively soft prior year comparison that was impacted by limited component availability resulting from last year's supply chain issues.  As you look at product performance on a trailing 12-month basis to adjust for the prior year comparison, product revenue is still up 38%, compared to the same prior period. Given the weighted average historical growth rate for the associated market categories is in the range of 6% to 8%, our sensors continue to take significant market share growing more than four times the average market rate of growth.  Additionally, our commercial teams continue to make solid progress against key commercial priorities that include winning a disproportionate share of large-scale modernization initiatives, leveraging our leadership and intersection detection to penetrate adjacent categories, including the emerging cellular CV2X category and attaching annual recurring revenue to our Vantage Inspector [ph] Vector CV sensors. In the fiscal 2024 first quarter, we attached annual recurring revenue to 29% of Vantage Next sensor units sold, which represents another record for Iteris.  Now, I want to review the performance of our services portfolio, which includes our various consulting service, managed service, software-as-a-service and data-as-a-service offerings. We reported record service revenue of $19.9 million in our fiscal 2024 first quarter, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. As noted earlier, this growth is attributable to continued strong demand, as well as some previously delayed consulting projects with subcontractor dependencies, which occurred ahead of the revised completion date.  During our fiscal 2024 first quarter, we also experienced some improvement in our internal labor capacity due to the initiatives that we discussed on last quarter's earnings call. While additional labor capacity had only a nominal impact on first quarter revenue, and the pace of improvement is still difficult to predict, we expect to realize both revenue and gross margin benefits from the additional labor capacity in future quarters.  The level of demand for our service offerings continues to hit new record levels. In our fiscal 2024 first quarter, we reported net service bookings of $34.3 million representing a 55% increase relative to the same prior year period. We estimate that roughly $24.4 million or 71% of our first quarter net service bookings will be recognized in the future as annual recurring revenue.  In the first quarter, a more notable service bookings included, a four-year data-as-a-service agreement with a total value of more than $15 million provide ClearData to a confidential private sector entity; and almost $4 million data-as-a-service agreements provides ClearData to an undisclosed media company; a combined $3.6 million in task orders provide hosted software and related services to the Virginia Department of Transportation; a combined $3.5 million in task orders provide managed services to operate high occupancy vehicle toll lanes for the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission; a $1.2 million task order with the City of Yorba Linda, California, to develop and implement a traffic signal synchronization plan; and $1 million dollar cloud-enabled managed services task order with the City of San Mateo, California for smart cord or network monitoring.  To sustain strong customer adoption of our ClearMobility platform, we continue to introduce important new solutions and feature enhancements. For example, in the first quarter, we released the alpha version of a next generation travel time and connected vehicle data collection and presentation system, as well as new transit signal prioritization features in ClearGuide Signals.  In summary, we are very pleased with our fiscal 2024 first quarter record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA, record net bookings and record ending backlog. Additionally, we believe Iteris continues to demonstrate significant progress evolving to a platform-based business model associated with improvements in solution repeatability, collaboration, scalability, and growth. In light of the very high degree of fragmentation and complexity in our end market, we believe this progress is both notable and superior to other companies trying to pursue a similar strategy.  So on that note, I'm going to pass the mic to Karry, to provide more color on our fiscal 2024 first quarter financial results, after which I'll come back and further discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year. \nKerry Shiba : Thanks, Joe. And good afternoon to everyone. Joe already described our commercial progress. And I want to avoid being repetitive. However, I want to underscore that our strength in the market is reflected in both the rate of growth and nominal value of our revenue, backlog and bookings, all of which were at record levels.  Also, keep in mind that when you view progress compared to last year, the shape of our fiscal 2023 revenue curve was especially impacted by supply shortages occurring in the first half of that year, which resulted in a degree of back-end loading of revenues. This also is reflected in the ratio of products revenue when compared to total company revenue.  In the first quarter of this year, products revenue was approximately 54% of total company revenue, versus only 49% in total -- up total in Q1 of last year. Joe is going to address this point again later when he discuss his guidance.  Moving down the income statement to the gross profit line, I would like to expand some on the commentary Joe provided, particularly related to the impact of supply chain dynamics on our gross profit performance. In the first quarter of fiscal '23, we experienced about $2.4 million of negative purchase price variance from aftermarket purchases of semiconductors and other electronics components, which was $1.7 million worse, than the $656,000 expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, demonstrating the high component costs that we incurred in fiscal 2023, have largely flushed through from the balance sheet to the income statement.  To give you a further sense of the state of the supplier market last year, the negative price variance incurred on purchases coming in the door in Q1 of fiscal 2023 was $5.8 million, as part shortages escalated dramatically, reaching its apex in Q2 of fiscal 2023 at $7.8 million of negative price variance. As I just noted, this pattern tends to also reflect excuse me, the degree of parts shortages that constrains sensor revenue in the first half of fiscal 2023.  From a year-over-year perspective, fiscal 2024 first quarter consolidated gross profit increased $6.6 million or 65%. Products gross profit improved by about 145%, bolstered primarily by the significant sensor volume growth, low unit product cost and the benefit of prior price increases implemented last year. Services gross profit was down slightly overall, falling about $200,000 or 3.5%. As Joe indicated, much of the revenue increase in the first quarter of this year was driven by subcontractor expenses, which carry very little associated margin.  Aggregate gross profit improved 840 basis points, driven by a 2,000 basis point improvement for products, which more than offset 500 basis point decline for services due to the product mix and higher third-party costs. I believe the principal drivers of the overall gross profit change are reflected in my previous comments regarding gross profit. Products revenue typically will carry a higher gross margin than the overall aggregate, now that the high cost impact of the supply chain issues of last year are behind us.  The sequential gross margin trend also continues to improve, increasing 600 basis points overall in the first quarter of this year. The principal drivers of this improvement reflect lower sensor product costs due to lower negative purchase price variance and the positive impact of sensor price increases. Operating expenses in aggregate were 2% lower in the current year first quarter, when compared to the same period last year, reflecting about $700,000 in restructuring costs that we incurred in the prior year. Excluding the prior year's restructuring costs, operating expenses up approximately $400,000 or 3% nominally. However, as a percentage of revenue, current year operating expenses declined 10.8 percentage points as reported, and were down 8.7 percentage points excluding the impact of restructuring costs in the prior year.  So you are aware, year-over-year line item comparisons for the quarter are affected by a reorganization implemented at the end of the first quarter of last year. The reorganization fundamentally established a more focused functional base structure, which resulted in about $900,000 of cost being recategorized and move from G&A expense to sales and marketing costs beginning in Q2 of last year.  As a result, it's more straightforward to look at cost changes more broadly. The most significant item driving the overall cost increase would be year-to-year wage inflation with numerous other pluses and minuses occurring in the detail.  The factors just discussed related to revenue, gross profit and operating expense, fundamentally explain the major comparisons in operating income, net income and adjusted EBITDA. For adjusted EBITDA, we delivered $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2024, which represents a $2.3 million sequential and a $6.1 million year-over-year improvement. The sequential improvement further underscores the trend of improvement that began in Q3 of last year.  Total cash at the end of the first quarter was $20 million, which was $3.4 million higher sequentially, and $5.2 million above the balance at the same time last year. These improvements continued to reflect the combination of higher income and strong balance sheet management. While cash trajectory can always be affected in the short term around balance sheet cutoffs, future earnings improvement, and good balance sheet management provide the foundation for continued liquidity improvement going forward.  I now will turn the call back over to Joe, who will discuss our fiscal 2024 guidance and provide closing comments. \nJoe Bergera : Super. Thank you, Kerry. The smart mobility infrastructure management market is highly fragmented, and is complex. However, it represents significant long-term opportunities due to favorable secular trends and historic federal funding that's been committed by Congress through 2026.  Additionally, the market is characterized by high switching costs and customer stickiness, benefiting established companies. Therefore, given the breadth of our platform, brand equity and customer reach, we remain extremely optimistic about the long-term opportunity in front of Iteris.  Over the balance of fiscal 2024, Iteris will continue to deliver against an aggressive solutions roadmap that includes the following major releases: a next generation connected vehicle data collection and data presentation system that includes a suite of connected vehicle applications powered by ClearMobility Cloud API's; a state of the industry cloud-based international registration planning, and International Fuel Tax Administration System for commercial vehicles, which among other benefits would capture valuable new datasets for ClearMobility Cloud; the introduction of Vantage Fusion features in our Vantage Apex sensor line, which will streamline our sensor portfolio and accelerate our connected vehicle strategy, and the application of artificial intelligence to identify, verify and predict certain transportation events.  We expect our fiscal 2024 release plan to drive further adoption of the ClearMobility platform, increase our customer penetration and improve the monetization of our expanding mobility datasets. Among other benefits, these dynamics should sustain and above market rate of growth in our total bookings, as well as continue to increase the average size of individual bookings.  Given this trend, I do want to remind everyone, that the timing of one or two large orders may cause some bookings lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter.  In addition to the focus on our solutions portfolio, will continue to pursue key operational priorities, including the productivity of our distributor network, the maturity of our customer success function, and internal labor capacity of our consulting teams. As a reminder, the tactics outlined on our prior earnings call have already produced a measurable improvement in our internal labor capacity.  Next, I want to address our guidance. Our first quarter results demonstrate the significant progress of our product roadmap and operational initiatives. However, I want to emphasize two important dynamics that Kerry also touched on. First, our prior year revenue curve does not reflect normal seasonality, since supply chain issues in the first half of fiscal 2023 push some product shipments into the second half of the fiscal year. And second, as I mentioned earlier, some service revenue that was anticipated to occur in the fiscal 2024 second half moved forward into our first quarter.  Therefore, at this time, we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal 2024 revenue in the range of $168 million to $175 million representing organic growth 10% at the midpoint. And we are maintaining our guidance of an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 7% to 9% of fiscal 2024 revenue and fiscal 2024 net cash flow in the range of $12 million to $16 million.  For similar reasons, we're also providing second quarter total revenue guidance. That guidance is in the range of $41 million to $42 million on a revenue basis. This revenue represent growth of 6% year-over-year at the midpoint and accounts for some customers' deployment and revenue recognition moving forward into our first quarter.  We're also providing guidance for second quarter adjusted EBITDA in the range of 5% to 7%, which continues to represent a significant year-over-year improvement. Our combined first quarter results and the second quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance point to a very strong fiscal 2024 first half.  Looking beyond fiscal 2024, we believe Iteris remains on track to achieve our Vision 2027 targets. In other words, we continue to estimate fiscal 2027 revenue in the range of $245 million to $265 million before any additional acquisitions, representing a five-year organic revenue CAGR of 14% at the midpoint.  With a substantial increase in annual revenue, we anticipate progressive benefits from scale to result in fiscal 2027 adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 17% to 19%. And additionally, we anticipate improvements in our liquidity to enable Iteris to resume our acquisition program, which would of course be additive to our organic Vision 2027 targets.  So with that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks. And we'd be delighted to respond to any questions and comments. Operator, do we have any questions at this point?\nOperator: Yes, we do. We are opening the floor up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay, our first question is coming in from Mike Latimore of Northland Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Latimore: Hey, thank you. Congrats on all the records here. So the data-as-a-service wins were interesting. Sounds like they might be confidential customers. But can you give a little more clarity on the use case there, and maybe also just the pipeline for data-as-a-service?\nJoe Bergera : Yeah. Mike, unfortunately, it's hard to provide too much commentary on the use cases because of the confidentiality of the agreements. However, I would say that we have a unique, highly curated mobility dataset. And, obviously various entities, both public sector and private sector entities see a lot of value in that data. But unfortunately, I'm not really able to find any additional liberty on those particular contracts at this time.\nMike Latimore: I'd imagine the gross margins pretty good there. Is it above or below corporate?\nJoe Bergera : Yes, we would expect the gross margins on the data-as-a-service contracts to be better than our overall average gross margins. And obviously, as we continue to grow our software-as-a-service and our data-as-a-service revenue, you'll continue to see progress and improvements in our gross margins.\nMike Latimore: Yeah. I see great bookings in backlog. Have you seen the -- is this reflect the benefit of the Infrastructure Act yet or is that still -- is that benefit still really going to be in the future sometime?\nJoe Bergera : Yeah, great question. So as we've said in the past, it's really important for people to understand that IJA funding, that's the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act funding will flow through the system, through at least three different mechanisms.  The first mechanism which represents the majority of the total funding, will be formula grants or what mandatory spending. That is already in the system. It is not specific to any particular projects and therefore, that funding gets mixed in with other revenue sources that state and local agencies utilize. And therefore, it's difficult for us to tie any particular bookings back that we may have received back specifically IJA funding.  The other form of funding is going to be competitive or discretionary grant money. That is awarded on a project-by-project basis and represents substantially less than the formula funding. As we've mentioned on prior calls, the U.S. DoT has begun to announce various awards. We'll be publishing White Paper explaining the mechanics in more detail later this month. However, what you'll see is foreshadow that [ph] when you get the White Paper, we'll walk you through all the steps that need to transpire from the time U.S. DoT award and the grant to the time that the agency, state or local agency actually received the funds is able to begin dispersing that to vendors.  And in general, that's going to be at least 12 months from the time of the initial grant award. And it can be as long as 36 months. So to answer your question, Mike, we're definitely seeing benefits from the formula and the mandatory spending, which is already in the system. But we're not yet seeing any benefit in terms of bookings or revenue from any of the discretionary or competitive grants. And we would not expect that for at least another six to 12 months.\nMike Latimore: Excellent. Thanks. Congrats, again.\nJoe Bergera : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Tim Moore from EF Hutton. Tim, your line is live.\nTim Moore : Thanks, and congratulations on the very strong sales growth and very impressive gross margin expansion. I'm just kind of wondering, investors have been salivating and patiently waiting for strong adjusted EBITDA margin, and you delivered 8.4% in the quarter. And I know, there's some caveats to that. Also, supply chain shortages. So maybe, maybe for Kerry, I'm just trying to think, you've given your guidance for the second fiscal quarter and for the year.  How should we think about maybe the gross margin magnitude, for the December and March quarter as services began to grow more, I mean, they're lower margin than products and there going to be a mix shift then. Is there anything that you can see as terms of projects and deployment visibility that could be pretty different magnitudes of gross margin in the December and March quarters?\nKerry Shiba : I expect some progression to occur. I wouldn't say that there is a single lightning rod. Tim. I think you've latched on to some of the keys, which would be continued growth in the software platform, which will provide greater leverage for us as we go forward. And, as always, the sensors mix versus the services mix will have an impact on our aggregate gross margins and EBITDA margins. But based on what we're seeing right now, we would expect some progression. But again, not a single lightning rod standing up that's going to cause any kind of spike, if you will along the way.\nTim Moore : No, fair enough.\nKerry Shiba : And, again, I just wanted to reiterate that we still have a high level of confidence in achieving our Vision 2027 target, which would be 17% to 19% EBITDA margins by 2027. A lot of that's going to be driven by improvements in gross margins.\nTim Moore : Good. No, I think you've added extra credibility to that with the 8.4% already in the June quarter. You still have plenty of years left.  So maybe just switching gears. I know you spent a lot of commentary in June, the subcontractors headwinds and how it was drag on margins. And then you were doing internal labor hiring and training. That seemed like that would have been a near term headwind. But are you seeing an inflection point now that you have enough internal developments and training on that could actually become a tailwind, as you get out to maybe October-November and everyone's up to see there, and you don't have to rely as much on subcontractors?\nJoe Bergera : Yeah, so that's a great question. So as I mentioned, we did see an improvement in our internal labor capacity, it actually grew by 7%. Now, just to be clear, that does not mean our total headcount is 7%. What we're talking about is our consulting labor capacity that grew 7% sequentially in the quarter, which was certainly helpful.  We still have farther to go. We'd like to see that get to something more in the mid to see -- by the end of the year, growth and sort of the ranges like mid-teens, so about halfway there. So there's more work to be done. But we definitely feel good about the initial tactics that we introduced, and we're starting to see benefits from those already.\nTim Moore : Great. It's helpful Joe. And then my last question, to completely change the subject. You've accomplished so much the last year, Kerry came on board. I enjoyed meeting him in person in May and he seems to have a very good grip on the operations. As the circuit boards going and supply chains better, and that all subcontractors getting better. I mean, you're checking a lot of the boxes on things that were impediments for you 12 months ago.  Now that you're kind of at that point and seeing the margin expansion come through. And there's a lot of confidence in your EBITDA down margin guidance. Do you think acquisitions are back on the radar? They might have been backburner? I mean, is there, do you have any time to look at them? And how's that pipeline?\nJoe Bergera : Absolutely. You want to talk to that Kerry?\nKerry Shiba : Sure. Yeah. I think clearly, we're able to refocus on our acquisition strategy. Now, Tim, first off, liquidity has improved substantially compared to the low point of last year. And we would project it probably sometime in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter liquidity would reach a point where we would be comfortable in executing some tuck-in acquisition along the way, as to what we actually execute.  We have the pipeline filling up again, we're looking at opportunities that are out there. And we are seeing opportunities. Tim as you know, it's always, at the end of the day a matter of, of valuation, and what the profile of any single potential target looks like. But I think all the factors that would affect the outcome are pointing in the positive direction right now. Liquidity, the pipeline's out there, there's interest, there's candidates. We just got to make sure we can get the right valuation.\nTim Moore : Great. Well thanks for those insights, Kerry and the color earlier, Joe. It may really feels like Version 2.0 is underway for the business model and well on track again. So that's it for my questions. And thanks again.\nJoe Bergera : Yeah. Thank you, Tim. \nKerry Shiba : Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Okay, Mr. Bergera, there are no more questions from covering analysts. Would you like to address any investor questions prior to your closing remarks?\nJoe Bergera : Yes. Great. Thank you, operator, I would. We actually received three questions, some of which were partially, perhaps answered already. But I want to go through each of these three questions. Because I appreciate that time and effort and then investors tick to submit these specific questions.  The first investor question relates to our share repurchase program. And specifically, the investor asked how much of the $10 million which has been authorized for repurchase has been repurchased today?  And the answer that question is, first of all, by way of background, I want to remind everyone that on May 12, 2022, the board approved a plan to repurchase up to $10 million of our outstanding common stock for an unspecified amount of time. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, so right after the program was approved, we repurchased 300,000 shares for an aggregate price of approximately $900,000 at an average price of $2.90 per share.  Subsequently we obviously experienced a severe increase in purchase price variances, which you're all familiar with and Kerry talked to. That was of course, due to global supply chain constraints, which impacted virtually every company with any kind of exposure to electronics components.  And because of that impact, it certainly began to consume a significant amount of our own cash. And as a result, we decided not repurchase any stock since July 1, 2022.  Now obviously, our cash position continues to improve, it provides for optionality. And we will certainly reevaluate whether and when to resume any repurchasing activity. But obviously, look at that in the context of a broader capital allocation strategy.  The second investor question relates to our Vantage Fusion product line. And specifically, the investor asked the company to provide an update on the status of the Vantage Fusion program.  So in response, I want to remind everyone that on December 7, 2021, we announced a joint development effort with Continental AG to introduce a vehicle to everything or V2X-enabled sensor branded as Vantage Fusion. At the time we did that, because we intended to differentiate the Vantage Fusion system from our other sensor or systems such as Vantage Apex to a large degree to minimize various roadmap dependencies.  And then subsequently, we've received valuable market feedback regarding the benefits of this capability. But we've also implemented various measures as part of our supply chain improvement program to rationalize our circuit board design and our manufacturing processes.  And so, as a matter of all those lessons learned, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we'll be merging the Vantage Fusion feature set into our Vantage Apex sensor line this fiscal year. And this has a number of benefits. First, it will simplify and streamline our sensor portfolio that we also believe because of some other moves that we'll be making, which we have not -- we're not prepared to disclose at this point, but we believe that it is -- will be helpful as a step for broader strategy in accelerating our overall connected vehicle strategy.  So again, the answer is, that we're working to incorporate the Vantage Fusion feature set into Vantage Apex. And that those features should be in market by the end of the current fiscal year.  So the third question relates to internal labor capacity, which was a question that Tim asked. And like Tim, investor asked us to comment on the activity, the progress and the results of our efforts to increase internal labor capacity.  And in response, I want to reiterate that, in our first quarter, our consulting teams, as we talked about experienced some improvement, more specifically about a 7% improvement in internal labor capacity. And we attribute that improvement through general increase in our recruiting activity, as well as also to some enhancements in our processes our capabilities to source international job candidates.  Looking ahead, we expect to continue those activities in the second quarter. And then as students get back to campus, in the third quarter, we'll be initiating our expanded on-campus recruiting activity, which I touched on our last call.  So anyway, I hope that those responses were helpful to the investors who submitted their questions. And as always, we appreciate the questions from all of our covering analysts, as well as from individual investors. And we hope you'll continue to submit your questions to us.  So anyway, before we wrap up, I want to share that we'll be participating in the Sidoti Microcap Virtual Conference, on August 17, 2023 and the Northland Capital Markets Institutional Investor Conference in Minneapolis on September 19, 2023. If you'd like to meet with us, in either those venues, please request some time on our schedule. We would love the opportunity to speak with you.  Additionally, we'll be conducting various investor outreach activities. And as always, we're available to speak with investors if you have any follow-up questions. In the meantime, we look forward to updating you again on our continued progress when we report our fiscal 2024 second quarter results.  And so with that, we'll conclude today's call. Thank you, everyone. \nOperator: Thank you very much. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."
