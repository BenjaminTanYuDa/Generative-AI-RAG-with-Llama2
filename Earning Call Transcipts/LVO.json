Now I would like to turn the call over to LiveOne's CEO, Rob Ellin.\nRob Ellin: Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. It's a really exciting time at LiveOne, and I'm extremely pleased on how all areas of our business are performing. It was truly a spectacular quarter and one that illustrates the power of our creative first model focused on super fans which rewards the talent and enriching the shareholders. As we near the close of fiscal 2024, we conservatively guided consolidated revenues to $115 million to $120 million, and we raised our guidance for fiscal 2025 to $145 million to $155 million. Of note, our Audio Division contributing revenues of $130 million to $140 million and $20 million to $25 million of EBITDA with over $17 million of positive cash flow. I'm so proud of our Audio team considering the time of the acquisitions of Slacker Radio and PodcastOne, the combined pro forma revenue was around $40 million with 400,000 members losing $15 million a year. Today's Slacker Radio has proudly passed 3.5 million members. This past quarter, added over 300,000 members and close to 700,000 year-over-year. We are guiding this year over 1 million new members. This past quarter, we onboarded 24 new podcasts signed to long-term contract, and we signed almost every one of our current podcast shows. We have a pipeline of over 100 existing podcasts that's 10 times the amount that any in history shows that we believe and many will join our network. We focus on great creators with amazing stories that can benefit and the increased engagement by joining our family. These shows are averaging about $350,000 annual in revenues to over $7 million adding. This gives us a unique clarity and strong comparability to achieve our 2025 financial guidance. Also as we expand our podcast roster in our sponsorship, we now have over 600 advertisers and partners in growing as well as over 10 podcasts as potential acquisitions, very similar to what we did with Cash Media. Kit, Sue, Eli and the rest of the podcasting have done an amazing job, and you will have an opportunity to listen to kit presenting at 11:30 call. I'm excited to announce this past quarter, we closed our first ever $20-plus million B2B deal with one of the largest streaming platforms in the world, a Fortune 500 company. This combined with our extension of our 10-year partnership with Tesla, extending their contract for at least another 18 months ensures increasing monthly revenues, which provides us with full confidence and our business plan will provide more and more of these B2B deals, we now have over 42 potential B2B partnerships in our pipeline across 8 verticals. In my 30-plus year history of high-level involvement in media and technology companies, anytime our companies have passed surpassed that $100 million in revenues with most of this almost guaranteed recurring next year. It has always provided both myself and my management team the confidence in the runway and the ability to drive further revenues and sizable EBITDA for our shareholders. This is the LiveOne Flywheel. It starts with creative first, focused on super fans, driving traffic and engagement and producing multiple revenue streams from the same piece of content. This quarter, our only negative EBITDA division, our merchandise CPS has cut over $5 million of costs and will continue to cut up to $7.5 million to $10 million of cost and use that cost saving to accelerate our celebrity brands. We will launch between 8 to 12 celebrity brands, starting with birthday with Geremia and Russell Devon. We sold out in our first few weeks of the first round of product. This past year, proudly our publishing division was nominated for 3 Grammies and took home 2. In the award to just the beginning, we created sounds productions platform to compete with splice where producers upload their beats and sound to a storefront for other creators to purchase them. Like Slice, this is a subscription-based service. But the big difference is our company and the creative only IP and receive royalty payments. There is nothing better for our young artists than receiving mailbox money every month. This model motivates and attracts creative talent to our platform, driving traffic, audience engagement, again, with very little cost to us in unlimited revenue potential, revenues increased over 300% in our first year. I'd also like to highlight, we created a subsidiary of podcast on Pulp Studio 1, focused on ownership of scripted IP, more specifically focused on second windows of selling to television and film. This quarter, we proudly announced the acquisition and launch of 4 shows, Opportunist, Lost in Panama, Vigilante and [indiscernible], which has already partnered with a major streaming platform and is waiting to be greenlit as a scripted TV show. Another one of those has partnered with a different platform and is already sold as a documentary. Our supply is deep and our possibilities are endless. I really hope everyone had an opportunity to listen to our newest podcast Town, hosted by, is a great example of the type of podcasts. We are targeting which have the traction to be major studio productions. We believe we currently have to current podcasts have the potential to turn it to scripted shows and more on the horizon, either creating our own or acquiring existing podcasts and the promoting within our community. Once again, only more and more IP license and merchandise in coming years, the division could become the most profitable division within the company. Given the current strength and future potential of our business, we believe our stock remains extremely undervalued. We increased our buyback from $4 million to $10 million, leaving approximately $6 million of capacity. Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention, and I'd like to hand it back to our CFO, Aaron Sullivan for Q3 results.\nAaron Sullivan: Thanks, Rob. I'll spend just a few minutes providing a very brief overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Consolidated revenue for the 3-month period ended December 31, '23, was $31.2 million. Slacker posted record revenue for Q3 of $16.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million. PodcastOne posted revenue of $10.4 million and adjusted EBITDA loss of $400,000. For the third quarter of fiscal '24, revenue consists of 54% membership and 46% advertising sponsorship merchandise and others compared to 49% membership and 51% advertising sponsorship and merchandise and other in the prior year period. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for Q3 fiscal '24 was $3.3 million. On a U.S. GAAP basis, consolidated net loss of $2.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share for Q3 fiscal '24. Rob, I'll turn it back to you.\nRob Ellin: Great. Thank you, Aaron. Again, a spectacular quarter for the company, huge growth again in conclusion. I just want to reiterate as each of my prior companies has broken that $100 million mark in revenues, whether it was Digital Turbine, in JAKs, THQ, Forward Industries, Grand toys, each have had substantial 5 times to 100 times runs for their shareholders. . I'm confident and cited because I believe this is the biggest opportunity in my career. I personally invested over $18 million in this company and increased our company's stock buyback to $10 million because I see where we're headed and strongly believe our stock is valued. We've said we were going to achieve hitting 10 million subscribers is over a 5-year period. We're well on that way and super compare going to hit there. If we do, we'll be over $1 billion in revenues and this will be -- the stock will be substantially higher. I want to thank everyone for their support and look forward to any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Alliance Global Partners. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Kinstlinger: Congrats on your 8-figure sponsorship deal with PodcastOne. First, is this a new sponsor or a larger agreement from an existing sponsor? I guess I'm trying to understand that this is all incremental revenue to podcasts current run rate?\nRob Ellin: Yes. So this is a brand-new partner. It started at the end of last year when we announced it. It will continue to grow. And it's way more than 8 figures. It's well over $20 million, and you'll start to see that incremental growth in this quarter and substantially higher as each quarter goes forward. This gives us a streaming partner, one of the biggest in the world, the Fortune 500 company and gives us a massive audience to reach content.\nBrian Kinstlinger: And then more broadly, we in the Googles and Facebooks of the world that the ad market is finally beginning to strengthen. And then we also have an election year ahead, which usually helps the ad market. First, are you seeing the same signs in the market where pricing might begin to strengthen and then will podcast benefit from political ad trends?\nRob Ellin: The answer to both is yes. We're already seeing that. And we're seeing telltale signs that this is going to be a fantastic year. As you can see by the numbers we announced this morning in PodcastOne. We almost matched last year, right? We did $32 million last year. We're at $31 million and change already with a quarter to go, and obviously, our fourth quarter, especially with this new contract is going to be quarter ever in the history of the company. So we're seeing telltale signs it's strong. Politics does work in advertising. But I think the biggest thing, Brian, to look at is the trends in podcasting. The usage, the number of people that are moving the podcast demographics that are moving, it's getting younger and younger as well and also the number of sponsors that are moving into podcasting. It's really a maturing business and what I've told everyone is this business was going to grow when we bought podcast from $4 million to eventually $5 million to $7 million. What I would tell you now, it's going to be way more like $7 million to $10 million by 2030. So there's a big market developing. And this is really a unique time for our advertising and podcast business.\nBrian Kinstlinger: The heart of the question, clear PodcastOne revenue is growing. Growth is a function of downloads versus price. I think you grew download 15%, if I read an article correctly, or unique visitors. So I guess I'm wondering what the pricing trends as I speak to the ad market is pricing generally been flat and you expect to increase? Has it been increasing? Just speak to pricing on the ad side, if you could.\nRob Ellin: Yes. I mean I can talk from the overall market, right, is increasing somewhat, right? But really what's happening for us is because we built this community, right, we're able to sell across the community and part of the excitement, and you'll see when you see podcast at Brendan and Schwab move over and Brendan moved over and doing -- he's already doing 2x what he was doing before because of our community, we're able to upsell and sell very different CPA with CPMs and some of the bigger guys are who are mostly doing programmatic advertising. So as a trend, the trend is our friend, the industry itself is going up. But for us, we're going up even higher because our community continues to grow.\nBrian Kinstlinger: I have a couple more, if you don't mind. First, and I ask this every quarter, I may have missed it. Can you speak to the number of podcasts that are pending on boarding and speak to the expected time frame? I could be wrong, but I think last quarter, you had 6 to the 27 from cast might be reading my notes wrong. So if I'm wrong, sorry. And then there's probably other spending. So just maybe, I guess, through what's pending a time frame.\nRob Ellin: We announced we added 24 this year. That's by far a record for the company, right? We're now up to 180 podcasts. What we said is, for the first time in history, we have over 100 podcasts on our pipeline. And the reason that's happened is if you read the announcement on Spotify, they hired a mid-team with very talented team of creators and they just got rid of them, and they woke up and realized they're the best at distribution, right? And we're a great partner for the distribution. But they're really managing these small podcasts does not make sense for him. So a lot of these contracts, there was $28 billion back in the industry. The industry was -- the trend was it was a seller's market for podcasts, both podcast networks as well as podcasters right now is a buyer's market. You're going to see from Amazon and Spotify and Apple and Sirius, a lot of these podcasts that do $250,000 to $5 million in revenues. The contracts are coming up and they really need a place that can't hold them and support them right in this market. And it's really not going to happen in these big companies. It's not really the right place in the base. So just the biggest pipeline we've ever had, and I fully expect to beat that 24 number. We'll have still a lot more coming in this fourth quarter, and I expect to beat that number of, call it, 27 to 30 this year. I fully expect to beat that next year. And just looking at our pipeline and how close we are on many of these. I think you'll see some really exciting announcements. You'll see some major, major podcasters moving over to our platform like Brendan did. It's rare that you see those kind of moves, but you're going to see them in a unique way. And the big guys they're going to control distribution which is wonderful that we have these partnerships with Spotify and Apple and Samsung and so on, right? But they're also going to be focused on the of the world decided $250 million contract, right? And the show just moved over from Amazon, $100 million a year for SmartList, right? There's more and more money pouring into the system, but the big guys are going to focus on how it stars and Joe Rogan. And we're going to have an unbelievable opportunity to acquire existing podcasts with traffic and audience as well as like we did with Cash Media. I fully expect we said we have 10 acquisitions in the pipeline. I fully expect additional acquisitions in the podcast space as well this year that are hugely accretive to our bottom line.\nBrian Kinstlinger: Last question I have, I think -- I don't think you discussed it, but I think it's a really important point that you and I have discussed in the past. So maybe you can share any stats for recently onboarded podcast how they perform compared to when they were on other platforms, not on the PodcastOne platform in the first 6 months or so, I think that we've had a good discussion and then I think it would be helpful if you could share some stats.\nRob Ellin: And I think this is a credit to Kit Eli and, and they've got 65 years of history in doing billions of dollars of revenues in radio, right? Sue Ran sales for Howard Stern and all 3 of them being on the who was a pioneer radio and created one of the great public companies and radio with this company previously with Westwood One. Our team has been able to move over podcast and without giving names, we moved over on podcast that literally had 20,000 downloads. It's making it a couple of dollars, very talented, 2 women, very talented from a small town. We moved them onto our platform. We put a mom with the Vanderpump, we put them on to all the house-wide which we're most powerful and they've now grown to 150,000 downloads and they're doing millions of dollars of revenues. So -- and there's multiple stories like that. And very few companies are left that can do that when they have a community that they're really working on the sales, the marketing, the PR, the production, all of it in one and working with that talent to deliver a way better CPAs and way more traffic, way more audience. You also put them on -- good morning America and put them on TV and did all the work of PR firm that really grow them and I couldn't be more proud of it. Brendan’s show has exploded since it came on a network. It's up 2.5 times since it from being over a cash media.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Hickman from Ladenburg. Jon, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJon Hickman: Rob, could you walk through like how podcast becomes a streaming or television-type asset? And what the revenues what your portion of the revenues could be?\nRob Ellin: Thanks, Jon. I mean, you and I go back a long way. I think I met you when I owned atmosphere films, and I had a slate of television and moment. I was very fortunate, those films turned out to be one or turned out to the move the movie 300, and the other 1 turned out to be. And we did well over $1 billion of revenues. Here's the beauty of this model. You take a podcast like Barnam Town. My partner and Board member, Patrick Waxberger, one of the great creatives of content Maven the Street, just won an Academy work for, created Twilight, Lala Land, came to us with a show called Town, okay? An amazing story, right? I'll make it really brief, but 300 people little town for any of you old enough to know this band called, a plan at in this little town of 300 people out Carolina, and all of a sudden, everybody explodes and becomes rich. Much coming out of the little money is coming out of their pockets. So how much money is created system. And of course, what happens and CIA and FBI and drug enforcement and tax authorities and so on. There's a little counter 300 people. That show I highly believe it's going to become the bidding work for the streaming networks. It's the story of Pablo Escobar infiltrating in little town in North Carolina. And for anyone who has an opportunity to listen to it, I think you got to really enjoy it. You've seen the shale seeing any of these true Triumph type shows. This is one of the best I've ever seen. And I think that's 1 of our 4 shows we've announced so far. Stay tuned because there's going to be a lot more announced any minute now. These 4 are all in this quarter, right? Opportunists, Digilanthia has already sold to a major studio. They just wired a $70,000 just to start with. So John, when you look at these things, you're going to start to get production money, you're going to start to get back-end money. And as we grow it, we expect to do 10 to 12 of those shows a year, which we're doing anyway, right? They're on our platform. Make some money of the podcast, but then sell to that second window where there's no risk in Netflix or Apple or Amazon or HBO buys the rights to it. And we sit there with the catchers met and collect money for the rest of our lives. I'm very fortunate when I did 300, it's now almost 20 years. Those royalty checks come into life. And so this really exciting next generation of where podcast is going.\nJon Hickman: So is there any cost to you to do that?\nRob Ellin: In fact.\nJon Hickman: Where is 100% margin.\nRob Ellin: Correct. Once we -- yes. So as an example, right, on Vigilant, we just got a 70,000 check, right? We get that check, right? It's already handed off, right? They've already hired the writers, the right. We're executive producers on it, and we'll continue to get paid as producers on it. We'll continue to get paid back and is successful. And literally, if it makes it, you make it the first year, you're going to get paid a lot of money. In mid second and third year, this becomes mailbox money for life.\nJon Hickman: Who in your shop is shepherding that initiative?\nRob Ellin: Yes. So there's a team of people. So remember, it starts as a podcast, right? Podcast audio. Imagine that now you can go instead of scripts and book sell for $1 million, $2 million, right? Then you get a high re-orientate here you already have proof that the shows you're already up the traffic sorry, there, the audience is already there. And now you're selling to Netflix and you own, okay, the show is already #4 on Apple, right? It's already had 100,000 downloads in the first week. They've got proof of concept. They've got proof of customer base. It's a very unique model. And I'm really excited about this. I think it's going to be a real winner for us. And it will take a little bit of time, but just as the small bits of money coming in, come next year to be very substantial, one coming in and growing every year.\nJon Hickman: Real quick. Can you remind the 4 that you've already announced Jilani, Barmentown, what are the other two?\nRob Ellin: Yes. So opportunist, which amazingly just we want just launched of doing 100,000 downloads. We're making a lot of money just off the reruns already, right? So that first 3 years of it, we acquired that from Cash Media. This already sold to a major network guy. Opportunities is partnered with a network to do a documentary up just 1 season of it. Guy, we're out with 2 other seasons to the networks and the other one is called loss in Panama. Will add another one almost -- we'll probably add another one every couple of weeks, Jon right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sam Lee. It appears that Sam has disconnected. I'll move on to our next question. Our next question is from Sean McGowan from ROTH MKM. Sean, please go ahead your line is open.\nSean McGowan: Are you able to hear me? Let me start with Aaron. First of all, congratulations, Aaron, on the recent promotions. But second, can you give us an idea exactly when the 10-Q will be out?\nAaron Sullivan: So we are looking at so it will be early next week. Deadline is Wednesday, the 14th. We hope to get it out maybe a day or 2 sooner.\nSean McGowan: Would you mind repeating those percentage breakdowns on the revenue between subscription and ad? And any kind of color you could provide on revenue outside of those 2 categories?\nAaron Sullivan: Yes, sure. So let's see. I think we mentioned that Slacker revenue was $16.8 million for the quarter and PodcastOne was $10.4 million. So that's 2 big buckets there. And then in terms of the percentage, it's 54% membership and then 46% advertising sponsorship, merchandise and other for the current quarter and then the prior year quarter was 49% membership and 51% advertising sponsorship merchandising and other.\nSean McGowan: That's just within audio, but can you just give me any color on revenue outside of that? Just any meaningful trends going on there?\nAaron Sullivan: So the outside of that, you've got basically merchandise revenue make up the remainder.\nSean McGowan: And then on the $20 million deal, if you could provide a little bit more color on that, for example, what time frame does that cover? And is all of that revenue going to be booked in kind of in 1 bucket? Or will it be spread around?\nAaron Sullivan: That will be -- that's over the course of the calendar '24. So you should see it in a relatively straight line manner over that period. And that will be in the advertising category. .\nSean McGowan: Okay. So it's all podcast?\nAaron Sullivan: Correct.\nSean McGowan: Then back to Slacker for a second. Any updates or color on expanded relationship with Tesla or with any other equipment manufacturers in it in the past that there could be some additional partners, audio streaming, anything there?\nRob Ellin: Yes. So let me jump in on that, Sean. So what we just announced is that we expanded our pipe from 35 to 42 partners, right, -- streaming partners, the first of many of these B2B deals. And we fully expect that at those 42, somewhere in the 5% to 10% of those will close this year. So anywhere from 2 to 4 of those. And each of those are with $1 billion to multitrillion dollar companies. Very similar to this type of deal. And so we can't be more excited about the pipeline. We brought a great team out of Microsoft, who's done billions of dollars of B2B deals and as you know, Sean, my entire business and digital turbine was built off the backs of B2B deals. That was just with carriers and hardware companies. We have 8 verticals here. So we fully expect to expand our auto business. We fully expect to expand our carrier business. And historically, Slacker has had partnerships with everybody from Samsung to Verizon to T-Mobile and as interest rates rise, and you're going to hear this theme exactly as I described in Digital Turbine for 7 years. The same trend is here as interest rates are going up, those commodity businesses must have a closer relationship and must own the data of their customers, and you're seeing more and more of those partners now lining up with content and owning their own content and having their own content deals versus giving it to Apple and Android and just allowing them to own all that data. So really exciting pipeline, the biggest by far in the history of the company. It's the one area that we're adding people. We're now at the 4 people in B2B. We'll continue to add to that group. And you'll probably see some announcements around that and expanding that B2B as we announce the next deal.\nSean McGowan: And when you talk about those 35 to 42 partners, is that all within Slacker or does that include partnerships that would be in podcast?\nRob Ellin: Auto partnerships, right? So even though this first deal is a podcast, that doesn't mean it can't expand to radio, right? So it doesn't mean it can't expand to our live streaming all of our paper view. We have these mass libraries of video. So don't be surprised if you start to see an asset cross over both of them.\nSean McGowan: And then last thing, Rob, could you give us a little bit more color on what we should expect to see in other products coming soon in celebrity? Is there any -- can you give us a little peak there? I mean the --its off to a great site, but what other things should we expect to see in the coming quarters?\nRob Ellin: I mean, be patient because it's coming any minute now, right? What I said is you're going to see another 2 or 3 products launched. So we have 2 lines already that are being launched -- you're going to see us across big spaces, things like coffee, right, cosmetics. So when you think about what's happened in the industry, the social media stars, which we live with every day, when they're podcasts with the musicians with social media so, we work with all of them, right? You think of Logan Paul and Prime and how it's now doing $1.5 billion in revenues, right? And think you think of Kim Kardashian and $700 million of revenues in 2 years and what she's done for the cosmetic industry and think of go back to Avion right inside of being created inside of it. We see this great opportunity with very little to no cost to us to be able to partner with our creators with already having the rev shares built and be able to launch products and find out if the social media drives it. If their social media drives it, you're going to have a great brand if it doesn't drive it. There's a pretty good chance that's going to be one you're going to pass on. So we expect to launch 10 to 12 -- I'm sorry, 12 this year, and we'll expand it 10 to 12 a year after and further the year after it. These will all be with very little cost to us. It's really just an extension of our content and new revenue streams that come out of it. And I can't wait to do the ones with podcasters because with podcasters, just think about it, right? 50% of the business is direct response. So they have proven records that you're selling products, right, directly off that podcast because these podcasts have super fans. So they don't have to be massive businesses, but they could be hugely accretive and usually grow our business overnight.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Brian Kinstlinger. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Kinstlinger: I have two. The first one, I just want -- I'm sure lots of people are thinking this about this $20 million deal. So I'm going to ask it to make sure we're all thinking about it the right way. If I look at PodcastOne's revenues, you've been at about $10.5 million for each of the 3 quarters plus or minus. Is the way to think about it that you could do $42 million-ish this year, whatever it is, plus or minus? And next year is you're already off the $20 million higher, so 50% growth based on that $20 million deal? Or is there something I'm not thinking about the right way there?\nRob Ellin: Yes. We'll come out, Brian. We can't go any deeper than we publicly announced. What we said is we expect to be on a run rate of $45 million to $50 million. We're going to have to update that shortly and give us a minute to do that, but we haven't publicly announced anything deeper there, but you're certainly thinking the right way, right? And one of the exciting things here is you have -- you now have your advertising business growing almost as fast as your Audio business is, right? So this is the first time we have 2 moonshots happening at the same time.\nBrian Kinstlinger: The second one, I just -- maybe for Aaron on the cost side. The pros and cons, if you could just walk me through what the first. On the OpEx side, it's substantially down in the December quarter to September quarter. I assume that's your cost-cutting efforts. I want to make sure there's nothing onetime and this is kind of indicative of the near term or lower as you've talked about in the past. And on the gross margin side, I'm not sure what impacted the mix. It was a little bit lower than it's been for the last many quarters. So just if you could just take me through the dynamics on the cost side and how we should think about them going forward?\nAaron Sullivan: Yes. Thanks, Brian. So the OpEx question, I think we're -- this does not -- overall, there's not any onetime -- significant onetime matters in here. It came down a little bit from last quarter, simply because we had substantial costs related to spinning off PodcastOne. So you had accounting and legal costs, et cetera, public filing costs in previous quarters. So you don't have that noise kind of going forward. So that's -- that's that. And then on the margin side, there's about 3 percentage points of additional spend in the current quarter where we're out acquiring content. We expect that to kind of normalize in the coming quarters. So you should see an increase of about 2%, 3% there. And I think that's kind of the runway we've been on previously. So should drop. Sorry, it dropped down this quarter should pick back up in coming quarters.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Thierry Willard from Water Tower Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nThierry Willard: Yes. And you've already covered a lot of ground. So I just have just 1 question. You're guiding to a very substantial jump in EBITDA for the fourth quarter. And I was wondering if you could give us some color how much of that is seasonal? Is it driven by a onetime deal? Or is it and what part of it is maybe leverage in the model?\nAaron Sullivan: So I'll take Rob, and then you can jump in. So for Q4, as I mentioned earlier, we had a lot of kind of onetime noise in kind of Q2, Q1 -- Q2 with a little bit leading into the current quarter on our efforts to spin out PodcastOne. So that's behind us. So we're expecting to see some cost savings there. As the audio business continues to grow into Q4, we just see additional contribution down to the down to the bottom line there. And that's really kind of the 2 driving trends there in the EBITDA for our expected for Q4. I don't know, Rob, if you have anything else to add?\nRob Ellin: Yes. I mean I would just say not PodcastOne. we had also filed a public offering for a Slack Radio to emerging to a Slacker, which we subsequently pulled because the market was so terrible, but also because the company is growing so fast, right, revenues and EBITDA. So we had the cost of 3 audits legal fees and so on is very expensive. And Aaron, who has just made CFO, he's just done a great job of that, and a great job of managing it. And you'll see -- I think you'll see those margins come back through this coming quarter.\nThierry Willard: So I mean if I summarize that, the EBITDA level you're forecasting for the fourth quarter is maybe a sustainable level going forward and in kind of a new quarterly basis?\nAaron Sullivan: Yes. I mean our EBITDA, as you can see, and we don't break down by quarter, but we did put out guidance for next year where we said our Audio business, we're just going to do $130 million to $140 million, right, with $20 million to $25 million of EBITDA, right? So you're starting to see some real traction and real move towards cash flow and bottom line.\nOperator: We have no further questions. So I'd like to hand back to Rob Ellin for any closing or further remarks.\nRob Ellin: I just want to thank everyone and appreciate your time in a difficult market like this. This is a great time for our company and growth. We're going to continue to buy stock. We'll be able to buy stock in the next couple of days. Now if the earnings are often we'll continue to buy stock. And if we're going to trade down at these low levels, we'll expand that buyback again if we need to. So I want to thank everyone and thank you for spending the time, and we appreciate your support in a tough market. .\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a lovely day."

Now I would like to turn the call over to LiveOne's CEO, Rob Ellin.\nRob Ellin: Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. Investor appetite demand for micro-cap stocks began to decline and soften almost two years ago. We made major strategic decisions then to protect our shareholders' capital, take aggressive cost cutting measures, and solely put on predictable growth units with the highest profit margins in an effort to strengthen our balance sheet, drive profits, and be a desirable place for investors when the market cycles change. We have used almost all of our resources to expand our audio division consisting of Slacker Radio and PodcastOne. This is the largest divergence disconnect that I've seen in 40 years in the public markets between large and micro caps. Growth at any cost is not the way right now. Over the past two years, I'm thrilled to announce that we have done a remarkable job of delivering $32 million in consolidated cost savings, and are looking at another $3 million to $5 million over the next few months. We have purchased over 3.5 million shares in the buyback and have left room to acquire another 5 million shares. Our balance sheet is the best in company's history with $0 debt and over $28 million in short-term assets. On our audio business, we acquired Slacker and PodcastOne to combined companies produced about $40 million in revenues and $15 million annually. And need a lot of work to clean up. This morning, I'm proud to announce that our management teams have reported a combined audio business now delivering $52.6 million, a record number and $10.3 million of EBITDA just for the first six months. We raised our EBITDA and cash flow guidance on the audio business $18.5 million to $21 million of EBITDA. That combined effort has been a $35 million swing from the time of these acquisitions. To clearly articulate and simplify why our hockey stick growth is coming from these two key revenue streams. One is subscription, and two is sponsorship. Our subscribers have grown eight times from 400,000 to over 3.3 million in the 5-year period. Our sponsorship has grown 2.5 times with over 700 blue-chip sponsors on our platform this year. In September this year, LiveOne completed the spin out of PodcastOne as a separately traded public company on December, symbol PODC. Management commitment to increase shareholder value issued a dividend of 18% to our shareholders. The spin out made PodcastOne, the first stand-alone podcast network to list and trade on a national exchange. And so far for the first time, investors now have the opportunity to invest directly in that fast-growing podcast business. Trading between $60 million and 100 million valuation since it started trading on Nasdaq, LiveOne owns 80%, leaving wide ones remaining for subsidiaries trading at nominal valuation. PodcastOne is doubling the number of top creators on its platform in the three-year period, adding 18 already this year. At an average about $350,000 in revenues per podcast. We have increased revenues to $21 million for the six months and growing up from the $20 million when we acquired the business. We currently have over 100 podcasts in the pipeline. This is about 7x our normal pipelines and over 10 potential acquisitions; the largest opportunity in the history of PodcastOne. I encourage everyone to listen to the separate PodcastOne earnings and business update call at 1:30 Eastern today. Now to Slacker Radio, we just extended our Tesla partnership for the 10th straight year. Every Tesla car sold in North America comes with a paid membership to LiveOne. These members are paid directly to LiveOne by Tesla. Expanding our management team with a clear focus on B2B partnerships, we identified five verticals and have now over 27 blue-chip billion-dollar-plus companies in our pipeline. This combined efforts -- combined opportunities almost guarantee another huge growth year for next year already in place before we even finished our 9th month of this year. I indicated last year we'll pass over 10 million members within five years and over $1 billion in revenues. Over the past 12 months, we've added a record 679,000 new paid members, an average of over $3 ARPU. And now passed 3.3 million total members, 2.4 million paid members. We expect to pass over 4 million total members by the end of next year and over 3 million paid members. To better understand these metrics, Goldman Sachs issued a report that the industry will hit 1.7 billion paying subscribers by 2027. LiveOne would only need 1% of that addressable market to easily surpass that number. Given the strength in the business, we believe our stock is extremely undervalued. So we recently expanded our buyback program to $8.5 million, leaving almost $5 million of additional buying. Now I'd like to hand it off to Aaron Sullivan, our CFO. Thank you, Aaron.\nAaron Sullivan: Thanks, Rob. I'll spend just a few minutes providing a very brief overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which is ended September 30. Consolidated revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, '23, was $28.5 million. Slacker posted record revenue for Q2 of $16.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $5 million. And PodcastOne posted revenue of $10.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $100,000. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, revenue consists of 58% membership and 42% sponsorship, advertising, merchandising, and other compared to 64% membership and 46% advertising, sponsorship, and merchandise in the prior year period. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for Q2 FY24 is $2.8 million. On a US GAAP basis, LiveOne posted a consolidated net loss of $6.5 million or fiscal '24. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 2.4 million paid members, a net increase of 697,000 or 38% compared to the prior year. Total members, which include free members were approximately 3.3 million as of September 30. Note that included in the total members or certain members who are currently subject to a contractual dispute for which we are not currently recognizing revenue. Rob, I'll turn it back to you. We may have lost Rob. Operator, do you want to open it up for questions?\nRob Ellin: Sorry, guys. So just to wrap it up before we go to Q&A. Balance sheet, the strongest it's have been in history of the company, $28 million of short-term assets with $0 debt. $15 million of debt was converted at $2.10 and another $8 million of debt was converted into PodcastOne stock at $3, well above both of those markets. Record subscriber growth, record listenership, largest pipeline in the history of the company, a record EBITDA, record cash flows, and a largest pipeline of acquisitions in the hopper as well. So with that, I'd like to open it up to Q&A. Thank you, everyone, for joining.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Alliance Global Partners.\nUnidentified Analyst: And this is on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, could you share any updates on ? More specifically, how many podcasts from cast have you onboarded and how many more do you expect to onboard and over what timeframe?\nRob Ellin: It's a great question. Thank you. So on cast, they had about 27 podcasts. We've onboarded around 6 or 7 at this point. It took a little longer than we expected because of the timing of the uplisting, which took us almost five months longer than we expected, but we're seeing great telltale signs. We'll continue to add podcasts. And I think you should see an additional update over the next few days with substantial podcasts added to the network.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. And then outside of cast, can you talk about what the reasonable goals are for a number of titles you hope to onboard annually?\nRob Ellin: Yeah. So this is going to be a really special year and that we've onboarded 18 podcasts already this year. We have over 100 in our pipeline that we're bidding on today. And these are existing -- almost all of are existing podcasts that are moving from other networks that the doors have open. That right now it has been --. For the last three years, this has been a seller's market for podcasters. Right now, it's a buyer's market for podcast networks. And so there's great opportunities and way better deals and economics for the networks than they were previously. And actually the floodgates opening. This should be -- the second half of year should be very similar to the first half of the year. And I could see us adding well over 30 podcasts this year.\nUnidentified Analyst: And lastly, can you touch on the lower revenue guidance range for fiscal '24? How much is the result of the ad market versus the pace of onboarding new podcasts or any other factors that I might be missing?\nRob Ellin: Yeah. Good question. So most of that is coming from the merchandise business. We have two things. One is, as articulate in the call, we made the determination to focus all of our energy on our audio business, and in buying back stock, and in cleaning and strengthening the balance sheet. So our merchandise, the merchandise business, we are starting to cut -- we just took $2 million of costs out that we announced a couple of weeks ago. We're looking at costs and revenues that are not as profitable. Some -- a little bit of it is -- some of the cash wants to take a little bit sign on board but most of it is coming from the merchandise side of the business.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks so much. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Thierry Wuilloud of Water Tower Research.\nThierry Wuilloud: Good morning. Rob, a couple of questions. You mentioned five verticals. Can you give us a sense for what they are for new potential flagship partners?\nRob Ellin: Yes. And these are just the beginning. There's going to be way more verticals. So yeah, for anyone that knows my background and knows what I've built with Digital Turbine, you're going to have carriers, which we've already been a partner with Verizon, T-Mobile, and have been partners with many others. So carriers, additional auto companies like Tesla, additional merchandise companies. I'm being careful in giving names because as we said in the last call, this pipeline is very meaningful. It's over 27 companies in that pipeline, and we expect to announce some of those shortly. So retailers, anyone that is competing with Amazon is going to need that. Cable and satellite operators as well as a personal gym equipment, anything from the telecoms in the world to gym equipment. I mean, there's going to be way more verticals that you're going to hear us talking about very shortly. We just hired a whole B2B team and you'll be seeing us expanding that B2B team dramatically throughout the next few months.\nThierry Wuilloud: That's great. You mentioned 675,000 increase in paid members. Do you have a way to -- is it new partners that you brought in? Or is it existing partners that are growing the members, that are on the platform.\nRob Ellin: All the above. Now, we have a spectacular relationship with Tesla that is continuing to grow and now has been extended for its 10th year, but we're going to continue to grow our partnerships utilizing all of our podcast creators, all of our social media creators, all of account creators as well as our B2B partnerships. And we're really special. And we separate ourselves from the rest of the crowd is threefold. Number one in pricing, we're by far the lowest in the industry. We're a third of the price of most of our competitors. Number two, in service and that we can be nimble and have the ability to do things that we do for our customers that others can't do. And number three is white labeling, being able to provide a white label solution and be able to call it Tesla radio or a Verizon radio. For that matter, almost any one of our partners that is 10 million to 1 billion users have the ability to white label and utilize that solution, which there really is no one else in the industry has that capability of doing based on their size.\nThierry Wuilloud: Great. Maybe just one last question. You mentioned 58% of the revenue from membership and 42% from sponsorship. Is that -- do you see that trending higher on membership as time goes or you think that's a good balance? Currently, how should we think about that?\nRob Ellin: What's nice to see is we've got two horses in the race now running fast. And so the podcast business has grown dramatically from $34 million. We gave guidance of $47 million to $52 million, right on a run rate. And the same thing on the Slacker side of it, on the audio side of it, we've grown from $20 million -- each of these businesses started at $20 million when we're acquiring them. Slacker, which we've owned two years longer is now doing -- this year, it'll be $65 million. And the same thing on podcast was doing $20 million. These were both losing a lot of money. They're now profitable. They're now EBITDA -- size about EBITDA coming out of it. And on the podcast side as you grow from $20 million, you're seeing some real sizable growth. And I see a two-horse race here where they're going to be pretty neck-and-neck over the next three years.\nThierry Wuilloud: Great. Hey, thanks for the answers and nice quarter. I appreciate your comments on the microcap sectors and how kind of unprecedented that current situation is. But hopefully better times ahead. Thanks again.\nRob Ellin: Thank you. Appreciate you joining.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Hickman of Ladenburg Thalmann.\nJon Hickman: Rob, just one quick question. Will you elaborate on your comment that the current quarter, the December quarter is going to be record. Does that mean the best quarter you've had in corporate history or the best third quarter you have ever had?\nRob Ellin: Now to be -- it will be the best quarter in the history of the company. And this -- you can see by a lot of the metrics that we've already announced. We've already given telltale signs of where the growth is and what the growth is. We're growing about 60,000 subscribers a month. We're announcing almost a new podcast every two weeks. So it's really kind of -- now the model is to come really easy. As you know Jon, with new podcast, we're adding $350,000 to $500,000 of revenues. So you see those announcements, you can easily figure those out. Sky and somewhere in that 10% to 15% your net margins . Same thing in subscribers. Every subscriber that we're adding, every paid subscribers are already adding, we're adding in the -- between $3 to $3.5 ARPU with about 30% margins. So if we can continue to do that, we continue to add those, this quarter is just going to be -- it's going to be a very, very special quarter coming up. And that's the reason we, again, raised our EBITDA guidance, even though our revenues won't hit the numbers, we would like to because the IPO took longer than we expected but the uplisting took longer than we expected. But I see telltale signs that the cast media as well as the pipeline of podcasts are kicking in fast right now.\nJon Hickman: So with the lower revenue guidance and the higher EBITDA, is that difference coming out of expense control or better margin?\nRob Ellin: Nudge. Yeah, just we're being very cautious. We just took another $2 million of costs out of the business and being very cautious on what pieces of business we do. Any risk business -- we're not doing any of those live shows unless we're getting paid on them. As you and I have talked about before. And then we'll start to see telltale signs. We're going to start to get paid a lot of money in next year for us to produce those shows with margins very much like Social Gloves, but we're not going to do any of them unless there is money upfront. Unless there is money upfront with a guaranteed profit on them, we're going to focus our energy on the core businesses that are working right now and delivering revenues. And we're going to use our capital to continue to strengthen the balance sheet and continue to buy back stock. If our stock is traded at almost a nominal valuation right now, we're just going to keep buying back stock right now.\nJon Hickman: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. At this stage, we have no further questions. So I'll hand back over to Rob Ellin for any closing remarks.\nRob Ellin: I just want to thank everyone. Thank you for joining and appreciate it, and we look forward to next quarter's numbers. Please join the Podcast's call on a few -- in a short period. And thank you everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines."

Now I would like to turn the call over to LiveOne's CEO, Rob Ellin. \nRobert Ellin : Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, and thank you all for joining this very special day for Live Five years ago, my team entered the fast-growing digital audio market with the acquisition of Slacker Radio. At the time of acquisition, it was a very distressed asset with $20 million in revenues and almost $10 million in losses and has spent over $180 million building the assets. Today, and I'm proud to say that we've just raised our guidance to $123 million to $130 million in revenues. On the audio side of it alone, we raised our guidance to $103 million to $110 million with a staggering $18 million to $21 million of EBITDA. We promised the Street when I started this -- that by the end of 2027, LiveOne's Slacker Radio would capture 10 million subscribers and over $1 billion in revenues by the end of 2027.  The opportunity is so big that TAM for this industry, according to Goldman Sachs, is over 1.7 billion paying subscribers alone. Today, I can humbly guide by the end of 2027, we expect not only to reach that $10 million but to pass over 15 million subscribers. We say this with confidence because LiveOne is growing over 800,000 subscribers, so you're at a 50% increase and ARPU of over $3. The pipeline for our B2B partnerships has never been greater. Each of these potential partners have $10 million to $2.5 billion addressable eyeballs.  At $15 million and $3 ARPU will pass over $600 million in revenues. That's before any ad revenues or an increase in pricing of which LiveOne Slacker have been the only one in the industry have not raised prices, and we're at a 65% discount to all of our competitors today. Slacker Radio expects to begin trading in a reverse merger with ROCL SPAC by the end of October. Separately, we then acquired in the beginning of COVID, we acquired PodcastOne also doing about $20 million in revenues.  Today, I can proudly announce that Kit and our team did over $10.6 million for the quarter or a run rate of $42 million. When you add that together with the acquisition of the Kast Media assets, which we've been announcing multiple podcasts and the acquisition of Fantasy Guru, our run rate will be well over $50 million. For the first time ever, we'll talk about our guidance for 2027 for podcasting well and expect that to continue to grow at this rate and hit over $250 million in revenues. The podcast industry has matured from $400 million totaling $1.4 billion since COVID. Industry expects it to grow now to $5 billion to $7 billion by 2027.  We have just moved up the ladder dramatically from #13 to #10 on Podtracs, passing the likes of CNN. We expect this year to be in the top set. We also excitingly, even though it's been delayed multiple times, expect to start trading on a major exchange under the symbol PODC in the next two to four weeks. With the largest pipeline of potential podcast and over 10 potential acquisition candidates, we will continue to roll off. We expect to continue to grow at a 30% to 50% year-over-year growth.  We now have over 250 podcasts on the network, a 150% increase since acquiring the company. Pre-COVID LiveOne had 10 sponsors proudly today, we have passed over 700 sponsors on our network. As we move from audio back into video, Pay-Per-View One has been announcing multiple different Pay-Per-View events across podcasts with Adam Corolla, [indiscernible] music festivals and social media events, social blocks. We delivered over $28 million and $4 million of EBITDA during COVID. It was $60 billion market and growing.  Our tech team has delivered world-class technology that is live streamed to over 5 billion engagements and 350 million live streams and 3,000 artists. We humbly project by 2027 over $100 million in revenues in our Pay-per-View And live streaming business, and it could easily be multiples of that number based on our size of our audience. Splitmind and Drumify, our newest acquisition, publishing arm is revolutionizing the industry, utilizing the best producers, artists, song writers combined with AI to deliver the first of its kind royalty sharing platform. With a TAM of over $100 billion, we guide to over $100 million in revenues by 2027. Our merchandise business has struggled, right?  We acquired it during COVID. It suffered because we didn't have any of our live events or any of our partnerships with Live Nation AG. But we've just announced a very unique collaboration, the first of many to come with Jeremih and Russell Bevan, who is the [Ben Ruth] of Napa Valley, the one winemaker more 100 point wine anywhere in the history to watch with the brand name “\"Birthday Sex”\" with Jeremih and we've run out of bottles already. We sold out in the first week, and we are now growing substantially. We're guiding that business where we expect to have 10 to 20 celebrity brands this year to over $100 million as well in 2027.  Together these 5 divisions, we easily surpassed $1 billion in revenues and over $150 million in EBITDA.  I want to thank everyone for their patience and staying with us, and we couldn't be more excited about the company, the spin-outs at about to happen with PodcastOne and Slack radio and the opportunity of each of our 5 divisions to grow and mature.  With that, I want to open it up to any questions anyone has. And I want to thank you again for attending. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Alliance Global Partners. \nBrian Kinstlinger : Great. And really, congratulations on this turnaround. It's taken a while, but you've done great work. Can you touch on the pipeline of podcasting in terms of M&A, what are the ranges in terms of sizes you're looking at? What are the general valuations that you hope in your discipline to acquire companies at and then just speak to maybe the mix in cash and stock and retaining management of how the plan will work. \nRobert Ellin : Yes. Great question, Brian. I think you know me long enough now and all of our acquisitions are in that onetime revenue range. They've historically been with stock. We've done [indiscernible] because our stock is down, right?  We have been acquiring it with the stock in PodcastOne. So on PodcastOne, we announced the valuation is well over $200 million when the stock is trading well below that. So we utilized our currency and PodcastOne to acquire both Fantasy Guru as well as the assets of Kast Media. We have over 10 acquisitions right now in the pipeline and they're really exciting. They go anywhere from sort of the size of $5 million up to $35 million, $40 million in that range.  They make growth from here soon. But this is that unique opportunity right now to acquire the smaller podcast networks and add them into the fold and really our team is the best in the business, Kit, [Eli] and [Sue] approved net over and over again. And we just see the excitement and energy of it. You're seeing us announce on top of the acquisition. You're seeing us announce almost on a biweekly basis, another podcast with traffic and audience that already exist, moving over to our platform.  And I think you're going to see more and more of that. So the pipeline for potential podcast to move over is over 100 and acquisitions in over 10 right now. So it couldn't be more exciting. And this is a great time to roll up the space. \nBrian Kinstlinger : And if I remember correctly, the acquisitions of Kast and Fantasy Guru have lower CPMs and your opportunities to increase CPMs when they're onboarded to your platform. Is that generally how when you look at those 10 or so in your pipeline, how it will work, they'll have lower CPMs, they come on to you? And immediately or at least once you negotiate you'll be able to generate higher revenue than just what they have? \nRobert Ellin : Yes, I think it's a combination of things because we're a full 360 podcast network, and I'm going to hand this to Kit in a second, broadly, our team, we do everything for those podcasts and we act as a community, so we utilize our other podcasts to grow them, but also the size of our sales force is just dramatically different than the small podcast network. Kit, why don't you take over from that? \nKit Gray : Yes. Sure.Yes, the ultimate goal is to raise CPMs, but it's a process, right? A lot of this shows that we're acquiring, whether by acquisitions or even just one-off where shows are leaving other networks or new shows are starting, the first phase of that process is to get demand on their inventory, start to sell out unsold inventory, give good packages to advertisers so they invest, test and work with these shows, get comfortable with these shows, then that's where the CPM start to grow. We have comfort with those advertisers to do things beyond just the spots and dots of what you would hear in a podcast to include exclusive episodes, content just around brands, social interaction, video all of these type of things. And that's where you're going to see increased CPMs.  The competitors out there that we go against every day are very much the spots and dots of the world, and we're able to excel on that, but excel on all the other things that we just spoke about. So that's really one of the main growth factors. We get these shows on the network and we get them into our system and they start making more money than they ever have. We do more together, we do more episodes, and we really charge forward. \nRobert Ellin : Just to add to that, guys. We just recently started to move over right, and signed some of the Kast Media podcasters variety who have struggled have been owed money, right the whole works. Kast had 2 salespeople. And just an example without using names, and you're going to read a lot about this very shortly, one of the first podcasts that came over, which would be one of the largest traffic of all of our podcast, we did triple the revenues the first month than they did previously. \nBrian Kinstlinger : But I think because you fill their inventory or because you had better advertising, why did you do triple the revenue? \nRobert Ellin : Both. Across the board, we just -- we have so many advertisers already on our platform. We're able to go to them and use that great talent and use those numbers to expand the opportunity with them and grow our existing advertisers and then programmatic as well kicked in. \nBrian Kinstlinger : Right. Two more questions for me. The first is your numbers jumped up in the first quarter before the acquisitions. I know you had some new content coming on. You're speaking to M&A. Is there also a meaningful piece of organically creating new shows? Or will M&A dominate the content -- the addition of content? Sorry. \nRobert Ellin : Kit, do you want to take that? \nKit Gray : Yes. Yes. I mean, what we're trying to do is there are shows that are smaller that are on our network that we know we can't get to the next level. And rather than kind of use our resources after a 9-, 12-month string of trying to get it to where it needs to be. We then churn out the bottom, 15%, 20% of the network.  And at the same time, we're growing the network by adding bigger programs with more opportunities that will be top 10, top 20 shows on our network, which will drive real revenue, right? And then we get them into our system and continue to grow beyond what we'd ever thought. So those are your those are your strategies, right, of growth. So when you look at the network, you're always trying to clean it up, get more efficient and bring in bigger ones and go from there. \nRobert Ellin : I would say, Brian, two of our newest shows we just added are already in the top 10. So you're seeing brand-new shows that are really exciting really coming out of the box with very strong numbers. \nBrian Kinstlinger : What shows are those? \nKit Gray : We just acquired Brendan Schaub. In his network, he has 3 shows, including the Golden hour, now or Fighter and the kid and The Brendan Schaub show. We have some more news, which is a really big news show that does not only really well in the audio space, but also in the YouTube video space. And those are just some of the new acquisitions that have heard -- that's occurred over the last 2 or 3 weeks. In the meantime, we're launching new shows on PodcastOne on an operated shows and we're acquiring other shows from competing networks that are unhappy with their current situation and they're coming over.  For instance, I've had it, Two Women out of Oklahoma, one a lawyer and one an interior decorator, they're hilarious. They were just on the today show just last week. Their show came over to us with 20,000 downloads an episode. And this is a bit of an anomaly, but it's a lot of hard work, not only on our end, but their end, that show is doing over 125,000 downloads an episode and we'll crack 7 figures in revenue. We're talking to them about launching another episode where they'll have 3 episodes a week, one on Saturday.  So that's the strategy, right, to find these people that fit into our mold and fit into our system and we can grow the revenues from low 6 figures to 7 figures even potentially even more, right? So that's really the strategy. \nRobert Ellin : One of the other great -- Brian, one of the other great things that's happening in this space is because it's not nearly as competitive where everyone is willing to pay these crazy MGs or crazy prices. We're negotiating way better deals than we've ever negotiated before. And Kit and the team, as I've always described it, have always played moneyball, but now playing moneyball, you're going to see a lot more 60-40 deals and 50-50 deals than you did previously. And we've always stayed away from those 80-20 deals and it's proven to be the right methodology and the team really understood what the right deals were. \nBrian Kinstlinger : Okay. Lastly, this -- the Kast and Fantasy Guru acquisitions, disclosing them depend on PodcastOne trading on its own? Or is there any obstacle in closing those acquisitions? . \nRobert Ellin : No, it's already happening, right? So Kast Media, we're buying certain assets of that, as we've already announced a couple of shows, and I fully expect you're going to see us announce some massive shows any minute now. With Fantasy Guru, I expect it to close in the next 30 days, right? It's an exciting time to close it because you go right in the football season. And we're really excited about this.  They've never done any advertising and sponsorship. And it obviously crosses over radio as well as podcasting. So we see a really exciting opportunity to expand that business dramatically and utilize our creators and our podcasters to drive more subscribers. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Hickman from Ladenburg. \nJon Hickman : Rob, can you elaborate on you said 2 to 4 weeks before podcast starts trading on a national exchange. Can you elaborate on why you think it's going to be that soon after all the delays? \nRobert Ellin : Yes. I mean I can't say too much, but what we said in the press release is that after being approved by the SEC, Nasdaq asked us for our audited statements, right, which was not an unreasonable ask. It was just 8 months into the process. So as you know, we've delivered those audited, right? Those are filed publicly.  And so that's all completed. And so I'm very, very confident that we will trade on a major exchange shortly. And it will probably be up to us as to what day we choose to trade and make sure that we do the right road show in advance, get out to the street in advance. And this has obviously taken a little bit longer than we expected and like everything. None of these are easy.  It's the first time ever done that you've done an uplifting and a partial dividend at the same time. And what's happened is it's turned out to be a blessing in disguise. We increased the dividend dramatically. We pulled in 2 acquisitions, and we're not done, right? So this is a really exciting time for the company and really exciting for PodcastOne.  We got to showcase the numbers for this quarter, showcasing a $10.6 million number. That's a big jump from where we were. So I'm really proud of the team, and I'm really proud of where this is going, and I'm really excited about these acquisitions. Kit just mentioned, Brendan is already on our network. It will be one of the top 3 traffic guys on our network and brings more and more male sports related, right?  We have a massive female network. We're just going to keep growing and we see telltale sign just the right time and the right place for us to go forward. \nJon Hickman : One last question. You raised guidance, but the Kast Media and Guru those revenues aren't in the new guidance until -- because they haven't closed yet, right? \nRobert Ellin : Correct. \nOperator: The next question comes from Joseph Salino from Joseph Stone Capital. \nJoseph Salino : Hey, Rob. Congratulations on a job well done, you and your team, hats off to you guys. My question was already answered by a previous investor, so you can take the next call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Sean McGowan from ROTH MKM. \nSean McGowan : Let me start with a couple of housekeeping things, the change in the terms of the podcast spin-off in the dividend, I mean, that was already announced, right? That change is already out there at the 19%? \nRobert Ellin : Yes. Correct, [indiscernible] the public filings. That was already in the public filings as we approved with the SEC's approval. \nSean McGowan : Okay. And on the valuation of podcast, well, first on the trading. So there's not anything material yet to be done that you need to do. It's just a question of when it actually goes effective. Is that the right way to read what you're saying? \nRobert Ellin : Yes. I think it's more than that. I mean, we're effective already, right? So effectively, you're a public company, to prove it. We're just waiting for an exchange, right, to be ready for that trading. And I'm very, very hopeful that we're on the 5-yard line. We're in the 5 -- yard line join, we may even be on the 2-yard line as of today. \nSean McGowan : Right. I meant that there's nothing material that you have to deliver like it's kind of -- the ball is in their court, if I can mix the metaphor. It's not like they're waiting on you to do something. You've done everything you got to do, right? \nRobert Ellin : Correct. Correct. And one of the things we should make clear, and we've made this before, but I should make it clear on the call, Sean, just to give you round numbers, anyone owns 100,000 shares of LiveOne. You're going to receive about 4,800 shares of PodcastOne between $8 and $12. So if you take the low end of the range at $8, this is a very sizable dividend, right, for -- and that's only going to be shareholders of record who own it at the time that we're actually up and listed in the next couple of weeks. \nSean McGowan : Yes. Now on the valuation that you've referenced a couple of times that was done the third-party valuation, depends on some changes in the industry over the last half year or so. I guess the flip side of you being able to get content more favorable deals is maybe the mood around the category is a little different. So can you talk a little bit about your confidence in the prior valuations that were done? \nRobert Ellin : Yes. I mean I would say the confidence is even higher. I mean, Sirius Radio bought a podcast network doing $10 million in revenues for $150 million in cash, only 6 months ago, right? And if anything, Spotify and Sirius' stocks have gone up substantially. Spotify came back down a little bit, but they're up very, very substantially from when that valuation was done.  So if anything, the valuations have gone higher in the space. So we're pretty excited about it. And I think the opportunity of acquiring small ones is that Spotify and Apple and Sirius and iHeart they're not going to buy these little ones anymore. They're just too small for them, right? They've gobbled up a tremendous amount.  They have big, big market shares in these. And I think it's an exciting time for us to be able to roll the smaller ones up because there really is no home for them anymore. And as you know, you got Odyssey and Westwood. There's a lot of debt out there amongst the radio companies that have built podcast networks. I think there's a huge opportunity to consolidate this space and really grow it in for us.  I think we're the only game in town that can buy the small ones and do the things that Kit and his team do. \nSean McGowan : Makes sense. Circling around to splitmind. Can you just give us a little bit more color on this Madden deal, like this could be an example, right, of things that could happen. How does this work economically? \nRobert Ellin : Yes. Great. So I'm going to hand that to Josh and I love the [indiscernible] because you and I have been -- Sean, you and I have been in the trenches of the game business and watch how much money is generated. I love music inside of these games. My kids play Madden literally nonstop and it's really exciting.  So Josh, why don't you jump in and talk about where that's going, not just for games, but film, television, rein overall with the publishing side of our business. \nJosh Hallbauer : Rob. I mean in general, publishing revenue comes from syncs and licenses. And I think that as we've got involved in this asset, we're really already showing how much value we can add on making revenue from that side of the business. Madden is the most prized video game in the U.S. I think it actually is the highest selling video game in the U.S. or at least the highest selling sports game. And we're track 1, we are the title track. We're the one that's on every commercial on all the Internet commercials and the nationwide commercials. And I think that, that mixed with the storing the music for the new Gerard Butler film Kandahar that just came out and doing the music for the Emmys last year, we're on track to really continue to grow the publishing business more on the sync and licensing side of the business. We're always focused on creating hit songs that's a given.  That's our daily life of actual music creation, but you can't discount how much money you can really be making from the sync and licensing side. And as we grow, we'll continue to have more assets to be able to put inside of making money on that side of the business. \nSean McGowan : I think this is such a high profile kind of almost like a first real public test case on this model. So can you -- without getting into specifics of dollars or even in the percentages, but just kind of conceptually, how does this work? What's the basis of the revenue that you get from that? And is it a flat rate? Is it the number of times the game is played, is there the number of times the music actually plays? What's the basis of the revenue? \nUnidentified Company Representative: It's all encompassing. But there is a significant per side flat fee when you initially sign up for that. And if you look at all the other artists that are involved in that Madden project, they're not artists that do low fees. It really is the most coveted placement in the video game space, in my opinion. \nSean McGowan : Okay. A couple of other questions. So is the -- Rob, is the trading -- a little bit more color on the Slacker trading, like you said, a little sooner than you thought, assuming that it actually happens then? Or is that what you guys had in mind? . \nRobert Ellin : Yes. I mean I think you're going to get a lot of clarity in the next 2 weeks, right? We signed the merger agreement a couple of weeks ago. I happen to be with Byron and the Hampton's right now, is with them yesterday and just finalizing. So we're ready to go.  We have to -- our audit check to be filed right to Slacker, it will be the first time we're filling them, which would be really exciting, right? People are going to get to see the numbers. And I've been in the audio music business for a long time. I own [indiscernible] previously. And as you know, Sean, had an amazing run with the stock in it.  What happened, no one could ever make money. We make a ton of money, right? This is printing cash. And obviously, having the Tesla partnership is -- and this being our tenth year in business with them and Tesla having a spectacular year is all exciting and obviously just an amazing partnership, right? And that's going to continue to grow our B2B deals, our pipeline of B2B, you'll probably see on LinkedIn and out there, we're out there aggressively even though we cut -- we consolidated 150 people in staff and took $31 million of cost out.  We're hiring B2B people, revenue, salespeople, revenues people because right now, the flywheel is explosive, so we're going to be hiring nonstop. And we're seeing telltale signs that I said I'm going to blow through the 10 million subscribers now before 2027. And we see telltale signs, any one of those, one more automobile company, one international carrier right comes along, one social media company. All these guys have been partners over the years. And as you know, I built digital turbine off the backs of carriers.  There's no reason that we can't pick up a carrier and really partner with them and give them content and give them the full 360 play. And the fact that we're the lowest price and the fact that we are willing to white label like we do with Tesla, we're the only ones in the world that can do that. There's only 15 companies in this space. It's growing to 1.7 billion paying subscribers and probably 3/4 of the world will have the music subscription. I think we're going to take a chunk of that space.  And I think you're going to see another car company, you're going to see international rights. You're going to see them all coming this year. And finally, we've got the balance sheet in shape and the flywheel is kicking in so fast that there's no reason that we can't land a huge B2B partnership very shortly. \nSean McGowan : Okay. Last quick question maybe for Aaron. When do you expect the 10-Q to be filed? \nAaron Sullivan : Sean, we expect Monday 14. \nRobert Ellin : And Sean, just before you jump, just one more thing I forgot to add to it. One of the things that I said to the Street is when we announced the deal, right, to merge into the SPAC, I wouldn't do that deal unless just like PodcastOne, we had other roll-up acquisition opportunities that could fit in there. So that may give us expansive growth and, again, at super accretive acquisition valuations, and there's some great assets right now that are coming available. So you may see that coming as well. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions, so I'll hand the call back to the management team for any concluding remarks. \nRobert Ellin : I want to thank everyone for their patience for being our partners in this, right? We couldn't be more excited about the company. And as I said on the call, I fully expect by 2027, we would be a $1 billion-plus company. It's just math, right? When you look at these numbers and you look at the trajectory and the growth to we're growing right now, we're going to grow over 800,000 subscribers this year, all right?  So over 50% year-over-year, our podcast business is doing very similar. Our sponsors have grown from 7 sponsors pre-COVID to over 700. I couldn't be more proud of this team and I think we really have this now. We have this in the perfect direction to really be able to run the table. And so I just want to thank everyone for attending and continue to support the company. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines."
