        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Netcapital Inc. Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Coreen Kraysler of Netcapital. Coreen, the floor is yours.\nCoreen Kraysler: Thank you so much, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Netcapital's Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. This is Coreen Kraysler, CFO of Netcapital Inc. I will begin with a review of our financial results. Following that, Netcapital's CEO, Martin Kay, will follow with his prepared remarks before we open the call up for questions. Before we begin, I'd like to call your attention to the customary safe harbor disclosure regarding forward-looking information. Management's discussion may include forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current views with respect to operations, results of operations, growth strategy, liquidity and future events. Netcapital assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. During the quarter, revenue decreased by approximately $1.2 million or 54%, to $1 million, as compared to $2.3 million during the 3 months ended January 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in revenue for consulting services that we provide in exchange for equity securities during the quarter. In the 3 months ended January 31, 2024, revenues from equity-based contracts decreased by $1.1 million or 56%, to $862,000, as compared to revenues of $1.9 million in the 3 months ended January 31, 2023. A decrease of approximately $52,000 or 23% was also noted in funding portal revenues during the quarter when compared to the prior fiscal quarter. In Q3, we recorded $179,588 in funding portal revenues, consisting of portal fees of $84,548 and listing fees of $95,040, as compared to funding portal revenue of $231,833 in the 3 months ended January 31, 2023, consisting of portal fees of $99,333 and listing fees of $132,500. The decrease in funding portal revenues for the third quarter is primarily attributable to fewer issuers listing to raise capital on the funding portal platform. Funding portal revenues decreased approximately 23% to $179,588, compared to $231,833 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We reported diluted earnings per share of a loss of $0.19 in the 3 months ended January 31, 2024, which was down compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.33 for the same period in the prior year. As of January 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,172,099. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Martin Kay.\nMartin Kay: Thank you, Coreen. This was a challenging quarter for many businesses trying to raise capital in the current market environment. We had fewer issuers listing on our funding portal during the quarter than in the prior year period. But we remain optimistic about our future prospects. All companies need capital and Netcapital provides an easy-to-use, easy-to-access platform that connects high-quality investors with high-quality companies. We saw both overall revenue and funding portal revenue drop for the quarter but we remain steadfast that we are providing the best service for our clients and that our value proposition continues to resonate with private companies looking for capital and with investors looking for opportunities. While our overall revenue for the first 9 months of fiscal 2024 dipped by approximately 14% compared to the prior year period, funding portal revenues increased by more than 70%. We had an increase in portal fees of $375,683 or 152%, and an increase in listing fees of $48,040 or 14%. The increase in funding portal revenues during the time is primarily attributable to increased offering activity on the platform that generated increased investments by investors who purchased securities on the portal. Another bright point during Q3 was that we closed a $4 million public offering in December, which adds to our working capital and strengthens our balance sheet. We're pleased to see the continued growth in our funding portal revenues and believe it's a testament to the platform itself and the need for it. The platform continues to grow with over 100,000 people using it and with over 50 companies currently raising capital. Moving forward, we plan to continue to scale our platform and to continue catering to accredited and nonaccredited retail investors, early-stage companies and others that need a platform designed to provide a real-time solution that's user-friendly and works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The scalability of our platform is a key driver of our business model, allowing us to grow revenues ahead of costs. As always, Netcapital will remain vigilant and dedicated to our shareholders, staff, customers and the investment community. And as always, we want to thank you for your interest and continued support of Netcapital. Operator, we are ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Bill Peters of [indiscernible] Investments.\nUnidentified Analyst: Do you see the crowd funding market consolidating? It seems so fractured. And if so, would management consider that and use their valuable NASDAQ listing as a potential partner?\nCoreen Kraysler: Martin, do you want to handle that?\nMartin Kay: Yes. Thanks for that question. Yes, very good question. We certainly agree that it's early -- relatively early in our industry, and we're still relatively small as an industry. I think if you look at the data that's collected by third parties, the equity crowd funding industry is probably around $1 billion, Reg CF and Reg A combined, flowing into private companies. And obviously, that's just a drop in the bucket compared to the overall amount of capital that's flowing into private companies. So we believe that right now, it's very early in the industry. We're still growing, and that there's certainly room for multiple competitors. That said, obviously, like any other company, we're always open to discussions and ways in which we can find opportunities to create value for our shareholders in partnership with others.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I'm not seeing any further questions come into queue. We have another question just popped up there. And it's from Bill Peters again from [indiscernible] Investments.\nUnidentified Analyst: I forgot to mention, where does the company stand with the ATS system, the alternative trading system?\nMartin Kay: Again, great question, Bill. It's certainly been a focus for management over this quarter. We are currently in a closed beta, is how we describe that, in a production environment. So we're working with our ATS partner, Templum. We have an invited set of beta users, what was previously in test environment, is now in a production environment. And we expect to be able to launch more broadly in the near future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Near future, 6 months from now, is that realistic?\nMartin Kay: Yes. Within -- certainly, that's realistic. I would expect -- we would hope to be able to launch sooner than that.\nOperator: Well, again, we don't appear to have any further questions in the queue. I can hand back over to the management team for any closing comments.\nCoreen Kraysler: Thank you, Jenny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. And we look forward to speaking to you soon.\nMartin Kay: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Coreen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."

Turning to our financial results for the second quarter. During the quarter, we experienced a significant increase in revenue from our funding portal reflecting a 151% year-over-year growth, helped by the success of several large issuers during the period. Total company revenues grew 15% year-over-year to $2 million as compared to revenue of $1.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net income increased 85% to $339,616 as compared to $183,138 for the second quarter fiscal year 2023 with the increase driven primarily by an income tax benefit of approximately $326,000. Operating income for the second quarter decreased to $52,220 compared to $336,165 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by higher stock-based compensation expense. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Martin Kay.\nMartin Kay: Thank you, Coreen, and welcome, everyone. We followed up the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with another solid quarter with both overall revenues and revenue from our funding portal showing growth. As Coreen mentioned, there was sizable activity in the funding portal of our business with a significant increase in our revenue and the amount of dollars closed on offerings, which we're pleased to have seen. There were two significant deals that were closed by issuers during the quarter. The first, Avadain, a graphene technology company, successfully sold out their $4.5 million offering after upsizing the offering several times due to strong demand. And the second deal, EarthGrid PBC, a plasma boring technology company, closed a $3.3 million offering. These deals are a testament to the confidence both our client companies and our investor community have in our funding portal. Netcapital is a unique platform that is a scalable, real-time, transaction processing engine that runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have over 100,000 users and over 50 companies that are currently raising capital on the platform. By offering a cost-effective, online capital raising solution and delivering exceptional issuer experience with easy access and onboarding process, backed by solid technology and boasting an extensive network of investors and companies, we're confident that we continue to offer a strong value proposition. As always, thank you for your interest and support of Netcapital. And operator, we are ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question this morning is coming from Michael Mathison from Singular Research.\nMichael Mathison: Congratulations on the quarter. Yes, great, particularly in light of current macro conditions, very, very impressive to have sold-out offerings like that. Let me move forward to questions. The crucial one, Coreen, you know me, I always focus on cash flow. And I noticed that while you often accept equity in lieu of cash for your fees, this quarter, if I'm reading your statement right, all the revenue was in the form of cash. Am I correct on that? And how should we model going forward?\nCoreen Kraysler: So during the quarter, approximately 26% of the revenues were cash. Cash revenues totaled $524,991. You can see that in the management's discussion analysis of the quarter.\nMichael Mathison: Okay. Great. Second question, we've talked about an exciting thing you've been trying to get off the ground, secondary trading on your platform, and I'm wondering how that's going.\nCoreen Kraysler: Yes. So, I would say that we've made very significant progress on that. Right now, we're just dotting our I's and crossing our T's. Given how close we are to the holidays, I wouldn't expect us to launch preholiday. But certainly, once the holidays are over, you should expect a launch reasonably soon after that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions in queue at this time.\nCoreen Kraysler: Great. Thank you so much, everyone, for joining. We really appreciate your time and attention, especially during this very busy holiday season. We're very excited about how well our funding portal has been performing. I think it's a testament to the product that we've built and the confidence that both investors and issuers have in our product. And thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's -- thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Coreen Kraysler. The floor is yours.\nCoreen Kraysler: Thank you so much, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Netcapital's financial results conference call for our first quarter of fiscal year 2024, ended July 31st, 2023. This is Coreen Kraysler, CFO of Netcapital Inc. I will begin with a review of our financial results and our CEO, Martin Kay will follow with his remarks before we open up the call for questions. Before we begin, I'd like to call your attention to the customary Safe Harbor disclosure regarding forward-looking information. Management's discussion may include forward-looking statements.

Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. We are excited about the momentum shown by the Netcapital funding portal this quarter as funding portal revenues increased by more than 110% to $375,856 in the three months ended July 31st, 2023 compared to $178,500 in the three months ended July 31st, 2022. This strength was driven by the success of several large issuers during the period. Total company revenues grew 13% year-over-year to $1.5 million compared to revenue of $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We reported a net loss of approximately $492,000 compared to net income of approximately $65,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and the diluted loss per share was $0.07 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.02. The first quarter net loss was driven primarily by noncash stock-based compensation for marketing and salary expenses that increased to $483,351 in the three months ended July 31, 2023 as compared to $32,953 in the three months ended July 31st, 2022. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Martin Kay.\nMartin Kay: Thank you, Coreen. As I stated in our fiscal year 2023 results conference call, I'd like to begin by reasserting our confidence in the differentiated value proposition of our integrated offerings and in Netcapital's ability to drive value creation for investors and entrepreneurs alike. Right now, we have more than 100,000 users of our funding portal, which is a sizable pool of investors for companies seeking funding. There are currently 55 companies raising capital on our platform. And both of these communities, investors and issuers stand to benefit from our forthcoming launch of secondary trading functionality, which has been a key focal point in the first quarter. On the investor side, the purpose of secondary trading is, of course, to provide potential liquidity for investors from the ability of users to trade shares. Securities issued on the Netcapital platform are and have always been specifically designed to be tradable as straight common shares free of transfer restrictions. Unlike other funding portals, Netcapital doesn't allow issuers to sell base instruments, debt, revenue bonds, tokens or other hybrid securities. We believe this strategy of only offering common equity coupled with secondary trading makes Netcapital issuers more attractive to investors. From the issuer standpoint, those seeking to raise capital, Netcapital is differentiated and has always been by our lower cost solutions, ease of automated onboarding, and superior issuer experience, as verified by issuers who've used both our platform and those of our competitors. On top of that, secondary trading should be a compelling added benefit for those issuers, providing another pathway for increased liquidity and the potential for increased company value. The new liquidity feature is essentially complete and we began internal testing last week. As a next step, we expect to launch a beta version of the secondary trading feature to a limited number of investors and we hope for a full rollout by the end of December. So in summary, the endeavors I've discussed represent milestone achievements in technology and product development and ultimately a stronger competitive benefit for the audiences we serve. As always, thank you for your interest and support of Netcapital. And operator, we are ready for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Michael Mathison with Singular Research. Please pose your question. Your line is live.\nCoreen Kraysler: Hi, Michael. Thanks for joining the call.\nMichael Mathison: Good morning, everyone. Thank you and thanks for having me. Good quarter, a lot of interesting news. My question really looks at your revenue forecast going forward. Last year, you averaged 55% year-over-year growth. You had four straight quarters of sequential growth. This quarter, you had around 13%, I believe, year-over-year. Should we be looking at that as kind of the new normal, a growth rate that's kind of that magnitude going forward?\nCoreen Kraysler: So, Michael, great question. Thank you very much for asking that. As you know, we don't provide a lot or any forward-looking guidance. What I would say is that the summer months, which this quarter primarily represents, tend to be a slower month for us. That's why we were especially excited by the more than 110% growth we saw in the funding portal revenues. So I would focus on the growth that we saw in the funding portal to help you frame what you think about our revenues going forward because that's really the cash engine of our company.\nMichael Mathison: All right. So speaking of kind of what's going on in the portal, you're very near to launching secondary trading, congratulations on that.\nCoreen Kraysler: Thank you.\nMichael Mathison: Any forecast of when you'll be live and what that will mean for revenues?\nCoreen Kraysler: So what we have told investors and what we said earlier in our comments is that we are currently testing the secondary trading feature internally, which is a really exciting development for us. The next step for us will be to open up a beta version to a limited number of investors. And then we hope to have the secondary transfer feature live by the end of this calendar year. And we haven't talked about the impact on revenues yet.\nMichael Mathison: Good. Thank you for taking my questions.\nCoreen Kraysler: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Nelson with [indiscernible] Capital. Please pose your question. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking the call. For your launch in December, do you guys have a sense of how many listings will be available on the secondary market at that launch?\nCoreen Kraysler: Martin, do you want to jump in here?\nMartin Kay: Yes, I can take that, Coreen. Thanks so much for the question. We are -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have specifically designed from the beginning our platform to so that all securities issued would be tradable in secondary. That's part of the agreement that issuers sign up for and have always signed up for. And I think we've disclosed elsewhere that we've had more than 200 companies who have successfully raised on our platform. So ultimately that's the goal. We will begin with a smaller number and working with our ATS partner, Templum, who is the alternative trading system platform that we're working with on the secondary. Working with them, we will gradually introduce those securities into the platform. So we haven't been specific about how many will be trading by when. But the point is, I guess, that all of them are ultimately eligible to be traded on the platform and obviously any more going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nMartin Kay: Does that answer your question, Mark? Thank you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, it does.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no remaining questions in queue.\nCoreen Kraysler: Great. Thank you so much, everyone for -- oh it looks like Michael Mathison might have a follow-up. Is that true?\nOperator: Yes, he does. Just one moment. I'll place him in. Michael, your line is live.\nMichael Mathison: Thank you for permitting one more question. I just wanted to ask you about cash flow. You were a negative operating cash flow last quarter so can we expect that for the coming quarters? And how would that be financed?\nCoreen Kraysler: Right. So what we have said about cash flow in financing is that we are currently in a position of generating negative operating cash flow. And that given that it would not be unreasonable to expect us to do future common financings from time to time. But one of the things, again, that we are very, very pleased to see is the growth, the very strong growth that we saw in the funding portal this quarter and the increased activity we're seeing in the portal overall, both in terms of the average investment size and the success of the larger issuers that we're seeing on our platform.\nMichael Mathison: Okay. Good. I just wanted to confirm that expectation. Thank you.\nCoreen Kraysler: Yes. All right.\nOperator: There's no additional questions in queue.\nCoreen Kraysler: Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone for joining us. We really appreciate your interest and support of our stock. We very much are looking forward to seeing investors at a few conferences coming up, specifically the LD Micro Conference and also the ThinkEquity Conference both in October. So we look forward to speaking with investors in person at these conferences. And we'll talk to you on the next conference call if not then. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nMartin Kay: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."
