At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I’ll now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Mr. Glenn Wiener. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Wiener: Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to VOXX International's fiscal 2024 third quarter and nine month results conference call. Yesterday, we filed our Form 10-Q, and we issued our press and both documents can be found in the Investor Relations section of the website at www.voxxintl.com, and we expect to post an updated investor presentation later this week. Speaking from management today will be Pat Lavelle, Chief Executive Officer, who is currently out in Las Vegas, attending the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show; and Michael Stoehr, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Their remarks will be followed by question and answers. As for today, I would like to remind everyone that except for historical information contained herein, statements made on today's call and webcast that would constitute forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. The company assumes no responsibility to update any such forward-looking statements and I'd like you to point you to the risk factors associated with our business which are detailed in our Form 10-K for the period ended February 28, 2023. Thank you for your continued support, and I would like to now turn the call over to Pat.\nPatrick Lavelle: Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Let me start off by wishing you all a happy and healthy new year. As Glenn said, announced with our team at CES and show kicked off yesterday. It's early, but the response to our new lineup and the various projects that we have in development has been very positive, and I'm expecting more of the same over the next few days. 2023 has been tough for everyone, not just as VOXX, our entire industry has had a very challenging year. And we're certainly happy to be turning the page. The global economy remains challenging, and we're doing all that we can to navigate through those challenges, focusing on three primary areas: protecting and growing sales in both the short and long-term, improving gross margins through supply chain and internal efficiencies, and lowering both our fixed and variable expenses. During the quarter, we were successful achieving two of these three objectives, as our gross margins grew by 90 basis points, and our operating expenses improved by a little over 2%. Sales declined roughly 5.4% with Consumer up and Automotive down. But overall, operating income was the same as the prior year. Mike will provide more financial details during his remarks, and I'll focus on the segments, what's happening and what we expect to close out the year, and as we move into fiscal 2025. So let me start with Consumer, as we have a lot of new -- news to report. Consumer sales came -- were up over 6% in Q3, with Premium Audio the driver. This is a big positive for us as the segment has been on the decline since the big bump that we had from COVID (ph). We made a lot of changes and investments and they're starting to pay-off, as evidenced by the growth this quarter amidst very challenging global economic environments. Within Premium Audio, we saw a good growth in North America market in Q3, driven by home speakers, wireless speaker systems and our new lines of party speaker systems. Europe was up as well, but our APAC sales declined as the market continues to be hard pressed. Overall, our Premium Audio business had a strong quarter with a number of new products on the horizon in new and rapidly growing categories. Looking at the recent NPD report for November, industry-wide speaker sales were down approximately 17%, but we were only down 9%. AVR sales were down 15%, and we were down 14%. The takeaway is somewhat positive, while our Premium Audio sales are down year-to-date. We are growing our market share, especially domestically and the new products and the new categories that we introduced here at the show and those that will launch in the early part of next year should help drive future growth into fiscal '25. Here at CES, we had a complete lineup on display under all of our audio brands. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have developed a completely new sound bar offering and had a number of new products on display, some of which have launched with others to be launched early this year. Our big announcement was the all-new Klipsch Flexus sound system powered by Onkyo. This is the first product that combines the strength of Klipsch’s Acoustics with Onkyo's electronic technology. It officially comes to the market this year, and we have high hopes for this product, as do our customers. I also talked on prior calls about our new party speakers, our Gig series, which was introduced in September and time for the holiday season, and it has done very well and has help to offset weakness in other areas. Party speakers are one of the hottest categories in the industry. It is competitive, but the market is open. We have great products slated for launch in the coming months. Here at CES, we unveiled our new Klipsch Gig series, one product, the Gig Max, is the first-party speaker that will be introduced with Klipsch’s legendary, horn (ph) loaded technology that we've been perfecting since 1946. These are powerful, portable speakers, top of the line products that deliver Klipsch’s heritage sound. Another highlight was the launch of our new Klipsch Music City portable Bluetooth speakers. We unveiled three new models, the Klipsch Austin, the Klipsch Nashville and the Klipsch Detroit, with the Detroit being the premier model and the biggest in our Music City series. These speakers, along with other compatible Klipsch models, feature the innovative Klipsch broadcast mode, which allows you to connect up to a 100 speakers at once to create a fully immersive listening experience wirelessly through Bluetooth. We have strong Premium Audio lineup in 2024 and moving into 2025. And also some big news on Monday with respect to Klipsch, and the Panasonic Automotive collaboration that we've had for a number of years. Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America and Infinity jointly announced on Monday, the partnership between our companies. The all-new and flagship 2025 INFINITI QX80 will feature the premium Klipsch reference premier audio system powered by Panasonic. The car with our speaker system is being featured here at CES in Panasonic’s booth and the vehicle is set to debut later this spring. It has 24 specifically designed speakers titanium treaters, a high-performance sub-woofer, roof-mounted speakers and Panasonic’s proprietary DJX 3D surround sound processing. This adds to our program that we announced last year on the Dodge EV RAM truck. As for other CE products, sales were essentially flat with last year. We saw growth in sales of our recently launched RCA hearing aid products with some other puts and takes (ph) between the categories. Year-to-date, other CE sales are up approximately 21% and while we expect some softness near term due to the overall environment, we have strong share in a diverse customer base, and we expect to see growth in some of the newer categories to help combat this. The big launch at CES for our accessory group with the new hearing aids under RCA. We launched four new products to expand our presence in this category. We also unveiled a new wireless HDMI Signal centers under the [indiscernible] brand, which connects devices to TVs and enables streaming content without cables. As well, we had additional other products under our RCA, [indiscernible] and AR brands. Moving on to Automotive. We had some challenges in Q3 as our OEM business was almost cut in half as we and our customers felt the impact of the UAW strike. As always, we base plans on our customer forecast, which obviously were not met when production lines were either impacted or completely shut down. With the strike now behind us, we expect to see the Automotive business begin to normalize. With the contracts that we have been awarded, we should be in a position of growth. However, with the general economy slowing based on the Fed's moves to date and car prices at all-time highs, we anticipate some near-term softness. During the quarter, Automotive sales were down 26%, with the miss in OEM, as I just mentioned. And primarily in rear-seat entertainment, which are the biggest programs for our OEM business. Business with Ford and Stellantis were both down due to the UAW strike with Nissan sales also down. VSM sales were up slightly given the volume of programs in the heavy-duty truck market and the new lighting programs previously awarded. We have a lot of OEM business in front of us, but with all of the supply chain and production issues over the past year or two, it has been challenging, and we are mitigating higher costs and improving our margins where we can. Our aftermarket business was down approximately $3.5 million, the general economy and slow down due to lower inventories on new car dealers, impacted sales across most categories, with some up and others down. For the year, the Automotives segment sales are off about 12.5%, and Q4 is going to be tough based on the current conditions, though, again, some loosening on the OEM side with the strike behind us. And as we move into fiscal '25 and in the years that follow, we have significant opportunities for value creation through the programs that we've been awarded and the ones that we're working on, which will give us new business opportunities to build our future pipeline. As for biometrics, sales came in less than anticipated, mostly due to the low in implementation. All of the projects that I had mentioned previously are still in motion. Nothing has changed, but during the quarter, we experienced very little progression in terms of rollouts. It was more testing, discussions and planning. We should see sequential improvements in Q4 and assuming all moves as planned, some nice growth in 2025. My comments from Q2 remain, projects with governments, financial service companies, health care companies, car dealerships and more continue and we hope to have more to report in the coming quarters as these programs build. To sum it up, our sales were down in Q3, but operating income remained flat with the improvements we made to our business, resulting in better gross margins and lower expenses. As we look into Q4 in the first half of calendar '24, we believe it's going to be tight. Look at what's happening now. Interest rates almost all-time highs, and that impacts not only consumers, but our customers as well. Credit card debt is very high. Government subsidies from the pandemic are over. After a decent holiday season and missed all of these challenges, we feel the economy is slowing. And therefore, we expect the next few months may be soft, and we're going to continue to be diligent in managing our costs. However, these are the same conditions and also get the Fed to start cutting rates and stimulating the economy, and that will be good for consumers and for VOXX. The new launch of products, especially within the Consumer segment should help offset some of the economic softness and the steps to reduce overhead that have taken place should materialize further in the fourth quarter and throughout next year. Margin should also increase given the new products and programs underway in those launching this year. We are in constant communication with our customers. We're managing our inventory tightly, and we're looking at all aspects of our business to get back to profitability. With that, I'd like to thank you. And then, I'll turn the call over to Mike, and then we'll open it up for questions. Michael?\nMichael Stoehr: Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'll primarily cover our nine month results and balance sheet, but first, a few comments with respect to the third quarter. As Pat mentioned, net sales were down 5.4%, gross margins grew by 90 basis points and operating expenses declined 2.1%. This resulted in operating income for both fiscal '24 and fiscal 2023 third quarters of $2.3 million. Net income attributable to VOXX was $1.9 million, which declined by approximately $5.5 million. This is principally due to a $4 million income tax benefit recorded in the prior fiscal year period compared to an expense of $100,000. The additional variance was in other income and expense. We reported total other expense of $1.4 million versus total other income of $36,000 in the comparable period -- prior period. Additionally, EBITDA was $6.5 million compared to $7.7 million and adjusted EBITDA was $8 million compared to $9 million. As for the nine month comparisons, all numbers are for the period ended November 30, 2023, and November 30, 2022. We reported nine month sales of $360.8 million, a decline of $36.7 million or 9.2%. Within this, Automotive segment sales were down $15.6 million with OEM product sales down $4.6 million, and aftermarket product sales down $11.1 million. Consumer segment sales were down $19.7 million with Premium Audio product sales down $31.9 million and other CE product sales up by $12.2 million. Biometrics sales declined by approximately $300,000. Sales are down for the year, and we'll continue to see some pressure in Q4 consistent with Pat's remarks. Our Automotive business was impacted by the strike and customer production lines and we're hoping we'll see some more normalization in the coming quarters. Retail is tight, but we're starting to turn the corner with new products in Premium Audio and our accessory products. Those other CE products have held up well this year with solar power balcony products, wireless speakers and hearing aids, helping to offset economic and consumer softness. We continue to take steps to improve our gross margins, which were up 170 basis points sequentially and up 50 basis points year-to-date. For the nine month period comparisons, gross margins came in at 24.6% as compared to 25.1% with Automotive segment margins down 20 basis points and Consumer segment margins up 70 basis points. Over time, we expect Automotive margins to improve with the relocation of manufacturing to Mexico, price increases and other steps we've taken to enhance our supply chain and lower costs. However, we need production to catch up. Consumer segment margins continue to improve sequentially. And again, new products should help continue to drive improvements if we maintain volume and of course, depending on product mix and customer programs. Total operating expenses. For the nine month comparison were $110.2 million as compared to $114 million, an improvement of $3.8 million or 3.3%. Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, total operating expenses improved by $5.3 million or 4.7%. We're continuing to look at all aspects of our operations to remove non-essential costs and are looking to lower our overhead further in light of the ongoing economic softness. We're tightly managing expenses, inventory and our cash. Selling expenses declined $3.4 million, an improvement of 9.6% versus the prior year. G&A expenses declined $1.3 million, an improvement of 2.4%, and engineering and technical support expenses declined by approximately $600,000, an improvement of 2.5%. We had restructuring costs of approximately $2.2 million, related to our restructuring and manufacturing relocation programs in fiscal 2024 year-to-date. This compares to approximately $500,000 of restructuring costs and $100,000 of acquisition costs in fiscal 2023 nine month period. We reported an operating loss of $17.7 million compared to an operating loss of $14.3 million, principally due to lower sales volume. Net loss attributable to VOXX was $19.9 million compared to a net loss of $9.3 million. EBITDA for fiscal 2024 nine month period was a loss of $6.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $3 million. This compares to an EBITDA loss in comparable fiscal 2023 nine month period of $3.2 million and an adjusted EBITDA of 5.6%. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of November 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million, which compares to $6.1 million as of our fiscal 2023 year-end on February 28. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $5.9 million at the end of our fiscal 2024 second quarter ended August 31. Our accounts receivable increased by $8.9 million as we're in the higher volume holiday season. Our inventory declined by $28.9 million for the nine months as we are moving through all the product lines. We still have inventory on hand to move through, and we're focused on that given the launches underway and upcoming, especially in our Consumer segment. As I noted during our last quarterly call, we expect inventories to continue to decline as we move through the fourth and first quarters. Total debt stood at $48.6 million as compared to $39.2 million as of February 28. The increase of $9.4 million relates to $10 million increase in our borrowings associated with our domestic credit line, partially offset by a $400,000 decline to Florida mortgage and a $200,000 decline in the amount owed on the shareholder loan, payable to Sharp as part of our joint venture. Total long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs was $47.1 million as it compared to $37.5 million as of February 28. As noted, the increase in total debt relates to the increase in our borrowings. This is typical during the third quarter as our sales and receivables increased -- than normally collected during the fourth quarter. This will be the case. During the fourth quarter, we'll be using our credit facility to support the final arbitration settlement, which was announced earlier this month. As reported, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Seaguard with an effective date of today, January 10. We have agreed to pay Seaguard $42 million in total, of which a payment of $10 million was already on December 27 and the final payment of $32 million will be made today. While we're not happy with the rules (ph), we feel it is our best interest as well as our shareholders to move forward and focus on our business and stop accruing interest and legal fees, which continue to mount. With the banking relationships in place, and the cash availability we have, the payment will be made, and we have sufficient working capital to fund our business moving forward. Of course, we're hopeful that market conditions improve sooner rather than later, and we can get back to cash flow generation and profitability. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.\nGlenn Wiener: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator:\nPatrick Lavelle: Okay. Thank you. I want to thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. I look forward to 2024 with enthusiasm as new product has always been the lifeline and the key to our growth, and we have a lot of new products scheduled for next year. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that’s all for our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Glenn Wiener, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nGlenn Wiener: Thank you, Norma. Appreciate it. Good morning, and welcome to VOXX International's fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. My name is Glenn Wiener, President and CEO of GW Communications, Investor Relations firm for VOXX. Yesterday, we filed our Form 10-Q and issued our press release, both documents of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.voxxintl.com. Speaking from management will be Pat Lavelle, Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Stoehr, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Their remarks will be followed by questions and answers. As for today, I'd like to remind everyone that except for historical information contained herein, statements made on today's call and webcast that constitute forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. The company assumes no responsibility to update any such forward-looking statements, and I would like to point you to the risk factors associated with our business which are detailed in our Form 10-K for the period ended February 28, 2023. Thank you for your continued support, and it's my pleasure to now turn the call over to Pat.\nPat Lavelle: Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Not much has changed since our first quarter remarks and -- in July. As the global markets remain challenging, consumer spending is down, and the automakers are still having production issues. With that said, we saw some modest improvements in our business this quarter, which helped combat the overall softness in the economy. As we look out into the second half of the year, we expect to seek top-line growth compared to fiscal 2023 and to be profitable. The extent of our growth and profits, however, will be very much dependent on the state of the car markets, especially now with the UAW strike and, of course, the consumer. We're doing what we can to combat anything that comes our way. And in 2Q, we took significant actions to do just that. We initiated a significant restructuring program: removing headcount and lowering our non-essential spend across the company; we exited several third-party agreements and restructured contracts to lower fees; we completed our OEM manufacturing transition to Mexico for most of our OEM product lines, which will reduce costs and help improve margins; and we can continue to work with our supply chain to redo pricing with more favorable terms, while moving out of our inventory positions to protect our balance sheet. We're essentially taking out everything we can based on lower sales volumes without impacting our ability to serve our customer and innovate. As for the 2Q quarter results, sales were down approximately 10% year-over-year and up 1.5% sequentially. Gross profit improved by 190 basis points, driven by gains in our Consumer segment. Operating expenses improved by over 5% and roughly 10% when you take out restructuring expenses. While we lost money in the quarter, our operating loss improved by $1.5 million, and we reported flat adjusted EBITDA, which was $3.3 million better than 2Q of last year. Within our Consumer segment, consumer sales were down $10 million year-over-year with Premium Audio down roughly $16 million and other CE product sales up $6 million. Our Premium Audio business has been hit hard over the past 18 months after a great run during early stages of the pandemic and the year that followed. Over the past few years, however, we faced global supply chain issues, a deteriorating global economy and a very challenging retail environment, with high inventory positions and rising interest rates changing the way retailers operate. I'm not saying that we're out of the woods yet, but we are now -- we expect the trend to reverse and to post growth again as we've retooled some of our products and have several new launches in the second half of the year with customer programs to support them. Premium Audio sales were up $5.6 million sequentially, and we're expecting to see continued sequential growth in the third quarter as it's the beginning of the holiday season and for our third quarter to come in higher than last year. The speaker category overall is down and many of our competitors are in the same position. In the most recent NPD report, the speaker market is down roughly 16% year-to-date and Klipsch continues to maintain its number one market share. Further, some of our business was down compared to the same quarter last year due to heavy promotions last year and a big program at Costco that launched in 2Q of last year. Now that's the past. And what's driving our optimism for growth over the next few quarters are our new products. We have retooled our soundbar offering and have a slate of new soundbars coming to market during the second half of the year. The Klipsch [Plexus] (ph) will be launching before the year is out, and it's the first ever product developed in tandem by Klipsch and Onkyo. Our new party speakers are doing very well, and new launches are planned in the second half of the year. This is the hottest category in CE, as I mentioned on our last call. We will soon be launching our new Klipsch Music City portable Bluetooth speakers, that can broadcast to other Bluetooth speakers and stereo and other speakers around the house or outdoors. Hookup is very simple, as you simply stream content through your devices. Our new subwoofers, recently introduced this year, are doing very well, and have received excellent reviews, which should help continue to drive growth in this category. And as we announced previously, the Klipsch Reference Premiere speakers will be on the Dodge Ram EV trucks with an impressive 26 speaker sound system. This is the first entrance of the Klipsch brand into automotive, and we believe this is a new area of growth as other automotive manufacturers recognize the value of the Klipsch brand. Other CE product sales, as I mentioned, were up $6 million and the growth was driven by our new solar balcony power product launched by Schweiger in Germany and, to a lesser extent, our new RCA hearing aids, which we introduced this past May. Our accessory business overall continues to be -- especially our core products continue to be impacted by the economy but more so by consumer spending. For example, TV sales are in a slump. And now while we don't sell TVs, but we do sell a lot of products that are attachment sales, such as remotes, antennas, cables and wall mounts. Virtually, all of these categories are down. But during the second quarter, we saw growth in reception, remote and wall mount products despite the industry being down. We are maintaining our market share, if not growing it. As for our Automotive segment, Automotive segment sales were down $1.8 million or a little less than 5%. Our OEM business grew by $1 million as some of the material shortages began to loosen and we fulfilled several back orders, particularly at Code for remote start and security applications. VSM sales were up close to 5% and our rear-seat entertainment programs were down for the quarter. OEM was up, but the obstacles we and the industry face continue to hinder our growth. Our aftermarket business was down for the quarter by $2.8 million, and we expected declines given the high inventory positions our customers have carried and the overall retail environment. But the good news is that the inventory bottleneck is beginning to loosen. The automotive aftermarket overall continues to be challenged with some puts and takes. On one hand, we see an increase in car sales. However, the largest part of the increase is at fleets instead of retail car sales. And additionally, where car dealers would normally offer aftermarket products to increase profitability, the tightness in inventory and strong demand has allowed them to just add market adjustment increases [through the ticket] (ph) price. We now expect with the potential of an extended UAW strike that inventory tightness will continue, but with that said the other OEM contracts that are in place, even at lower-than-projected volumes, should help drive top-line. However, it's the bottom-line that we're focused on most. We instituted price increases, reworked our supply chain network, developed new technologies using different chips given availability, and transitioned most of our production lines from Florida to Mexico. We're beginning to see the positive impact of all these moves and should see further improvements in the coming years with production overhead coming down more significantly next year. And looking ahead, we have new programs with Ford for the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition, our new lighting program with Nissan starts next year, and our program to support the new postal trucks also starts next year. As for our Biometrics segment, sales came in approximately $200,000, lower than the prior year and our budget. This was primarily due to lower licenses and again to some projects being pushed out. Everything that we have talked about on prior calls remains in place. We're continuing to work with car dealers, infrastructures, governments, financial service companies, and on healthcare programs. With respect to the latter, we recently submitted our final prototype to our partner, which is now in the final step of validation. Production should begin by the middle of next year, and we expect other opportunities to arise with this customer and others once it's in the field and we are focused on growing our embedded solution portfolio. To sum it up, the second quarter was expected and we're not pleased with our results for the first half of the year. We've taken more aggressive actions to combat the economy and other issues we're facing. And the past actions coupled with the recent restructuring will help improve margins and lower our costs. We expect growth in the second half of the year based on the contracts we have, the new programs we've secured, and both the new products we've launched and will be launching. Of course, we're mindful of any further deterioration in the economy, and we expect markets to remain hard pressed for the next year or so. If things worsen, we'll take more action, but we believe we have made the necessary adjustments in our business to drive profitability in the second half and to start fiscal 2025 in a more competitive position. One last item to discuss before I turn the call over to Mike. As you may have seen in our earnings release and the Form 4 that was filed yesterday, we have a new strategic investor in VOXX, Gentex Corporation, a company that we currently do business with, entered into a stock purchase agreement with Avalon Park LLC and Avalon Park Group Holding AG, both of which are controlled by Beat Kahli, our President and one of VOXX's largest shareholders. Collectively, Avalon has agreed to sell 50% of its holdings to Gentex or approximately 3.1 million shares in two separate transactions. The first transaction of 1.57 million shares was completed on Friday at $10 per share, representing a 32.5% premium to our stock price as of October 5, the day prior to the transaction. The second transaction of the same amount will be in January 24, and the stock price will be based on the formula as noted in our release. When complete, Gentex will own approximately 15.1% of our Class A common stock and will become one of our three largest shareholders. When Beat came on as President, one of his primary focus areas was strategic partnerships. This was probably his number one priority as we were looking to align with industry leaders to help drive growth and value in our business. With Gentex, we have found a great partner as we are collaborating with them in both our Biometric and Automotive segments on current projects, while concurrently looking to drive innovation in our offerings to grow our joint businesses and market share. Steve Downing, who serves as CEO and President of Gentex, also sits on our Board, and this alliance is one that we believe holds great promise for our company and our shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike to review financials and then we'll open it for questions. Michael?\nMichael Stoehr: Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We reported total second quarter net sales of $113.6 million, a decline of approximately $12.1 million. Within this, Automotive segment sales were down $1.8 million, Consumer segment sales were down $10 million, and Biometric segment sales declined by approximately $100,000. While sales were down year-over-year, they were up sequentially by $1.7 million, and we're expecting improvements in the second half of the year. Within Automotive, OEM product sales increased by $1 million and aftermarket product sales declined by $2.8 million. And within the Consumer, Premium Audio product sales declined by $16 million, while other CE product sales increased by $6 million. We reported gross margins of 25.2%, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to second quarter last year and an improvement of 60 basis points sequentially. Automotive margins were essentially flat and increase was driven by the improvement in our Consumer segment, which we anticipate will continue. If Automotive volumes materialize as our customers expect, we should see improvements in our Automotive segment as well as with the relocation of manufacturing to Mexico now complete and other changes we've made to our infrastructure and supply chain. Our operating expenses improved by $2.1 million year-over-year as we continue to lower our costs. Selling expenses declined by $1.8 million or 15.5%. G&A expenses declined by $1.6 million or 8.5%. And engineering and technical support expenses declined by $400,000. As Pat noted, during the second quarter, we initiated a large restructuring program to lower our costs further in light of the current environment and incurred restructuring expenses of $2 million in fiscal 2024 second quarter compared to $200,000 in the comparable fiscal 2023 period. Excluding restructuring expenses, total operating expenses for the comparable second quarter periods declined by $3.9 million or close to 10%. We reported an operating loss of $8.5 million compared to $10 million in the second quarter of last year and a net loss attributable to VOXX of $11.1 million compared to $10.9 million. EBITDA in the second quarter was a loss of $5.4 million and adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat. This compares to an EBITDA loss of $6.8 million and adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. I'll note, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA improved on a sequential basis by $2.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Through the first six months of fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, net sales were down 11.3%, with Automotive segment sales down 3.9% and Consumer segment sales down 14.5%. Again, as Pat noted, we anticipate year-over-year growth in the second half of the year. Gross margins of 24.9% improved by 30 basis points, and we expect further improvements in the second half of the year as well for the reasons Pat covered. Operating expenses improved by 3.8%, or 6% when excluding restructuring expenses and acquisition costs. On an operating basis, we lost $19.9 million compared to a loss of $16.7 million and net loss attributable to VOXX in fiscal 2024 six-month period was $21.8 million as compared to a net loss of $16.7 million. Lastly, we reported an EBITDA loss of $13 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5 million. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of August 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 million, which compares to $5.2 million as of May 31 and $6.1 million as of our fiscal 2023 year-end of February 28. Our cash receivable declined by approximately $21 million and our inventory position declined by approximately $1 million compared to fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. Our inventory position declined by approximately $10 million sequentially. And as we move through the inventory during the holiday season, we expect our inventory balances decline further. Our total debt stood at $42.8 million as compared to $39.2 million as of February 28. The increase in total debt was driven by a $4.1 million increase in our borrowings associated with our domestic credit facility, offset by a $250,000 decline in our Florida mortgage and a $200,000 decline in the amount owed on the shareholder loan payable to Sharp as part of our joint venture. Total long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs was $41.2 million as of August 31 as compared to $37.5 million as of February 28. Excuse me, as I said, our operating expenses improved by $2.1 million year-over-year. So, this ends my remarks. And operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nTom Forte: Great. Thanks. I had a couple questions. I'll go one at a time. So, first, congrats on the Gentex investment. Pat, can you talk at a high level about your opportunity to monetize EyeLock on a near-term and a longer-term basis?\nPat Lavelle: Well, when we look at Eyelock, as I said, the final prototype went over to our customer. We expect that everything will go well with that prototype. And production for their particular machine is scheduled for the middle of next year, which we believe we will be on it. It is a long-term program. I can't get into much detail on it at this point, but it is a long-term program which will have material positive impact on EyeLock.\nTom Forte: And then second question, can we talk about sell-in and sell-through? So, are you seeing any change in behavior for large consumer electronics retailers when we think about their willingness to add inventory? And then, in the sell-through part, do you think consumers are responding favorably to increased promotional activity within the consumer electronics category, or do you feel like that's not very effective in today's current environment?\nPat Lavelle: Well, I think that when we look at sell-in, we look at the retailers being quite conservative with what they're taking in. We have not seen issues with their sell-through. So, they apparently are taking the proper amount of product coming in. There will be promotions throughout the holiday season. It's generally our biggest quarter. But obviously, there's been a change in consumer behavior with credit cards being at all-time high, interest rates on credit cards being very, very high, and we know that we see shrinking savings accounts on consumers. So, some of the pent-up money that was sitting around since COVID is being spent. And when we see the problems, geopolitical, we see gas rising, putting more pressure on the consumer. But like I said, I think the retailers are bringing in what they perceive that they are going to be successful in moving out, and we think they will.\nTom Forte: And then, is it too conservative to think about the consumer electronics category and think about historical refresh rates? So, I think there's a school of thought that in the consumer electronics category and the home category, there was a massive pull forward on COVID. So is it too conservative to just think of historical refresh rates for Premium Audio and things of that nature and that's when things could rebound?\nPat Lavelle: Yeah, I mean, what I had indicated on the call that I said that we think the markets would be hard pressed well into next year. When you're looking at the home theater and some of the things for the home that we sell, the refresh rates, it's not like a car where you move it out every two or three years. So, the buy-forward or pull-forward that we had seen during the pandemic when everybody was locked in, I think we've got another year or 18 months before we start to see a more normal pattern in consumer purchasing of consumer electronics for the home. There might be certain categories that will do well. Like I mentioned, our party speakers, it's a fairly new category. So that's something that we believe will do well. But the typical product, we see that it'll take some time to get back to normal.\nTom Forte: Great. Lastly, as it pertains to the auto worker strike, I would think that you may be buffered/protected to the extent that I think historically you're in some of the most popular products within Stellantis, and it was my impression that they had built inventory perhaps in anticipation of the strikes. So, how should we think about -- how can we monitor the strikes and the potential impact on VOXX?\nPat Lavelle: Well, when we look at that, some of the plants that we receive product from have not closed or have not been shut down at this particular point, but we did see a slowdown in ordering. If the UAW strike continues longer, we will see a lagging effect on inventories on the dealer's lots, which will impact our aftermarket automotive sales. And certainly closure of any plants that we pull merchandise or vehicles from will have an immediate effect on the automotive business. However, we have gains with our heavy-duty truck manufacturers, fleets, and other OEMs outside of the big three automakers that are part of the UAW strike. So, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We are seeing increases in the other sectors of our OEM automotive business, but it could be offset by some slowness due to closures.\nTom Forte: Thanks for taking my questions, Pat. Appreciate it.\nPat Lavelle: Very good, Tom. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I'm currently showing no further questions. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Pat Lavelle for closing remarks.\nPat Lavelle: Okay. Thank you. As we look into the third quarter, as I said to Tom, it's been our -- historically, our third quarter. We have a number of different programs that we do have scheduled for the quarter. So, we're looking at growing our business sequentially and, hopefully, the cuts that we put in place are significant enough for us to turn profitable for the balance of the year. I want to thank you for taking the time and coming on the call this morning, and I wish you all a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Glenn Wiener. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Wiener: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to VOXX International's fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call. Yesterday, we filed our Form 10-Q and issued a press release, both documents of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.voxxintl.com. Speaking from management today will be Pat Lavelle, Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Stoehr, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our President, Beat Kahli, is also with us today and following prepared remarks, all will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. As a reminder, next week on Thursday, July 20th, we'll be hosting our fiscal 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. This will be a virtual meeting, held at 10:00 AM Eastern and shareholders can attend by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/voxx2023. As for today, I'd like to remind everyone that except for historical information contained herein, statements made on today's call and webcast that would constitute forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. The company assumes no responsibility to update any such forward-looking statements, and I'd like to point you to the risk factors associated with our business, which are detailed in our Form 10-K for the period ended 02/28/2023. Thank you for your continued support, and it's my pleasure to now turn the call over to Pat.\nPat Lavelle: Thank you, Glenn. And good morning, everyone. The market remains challenging and the impact is reflected in our first quarter results. The retail environment is tough globally. And while we have a number of good things materializing throughout our segments, the economy remains a primary obstacle near-term. Q1 net sales were down roughly 13% with the Automotive segment down 3% and the Consumer segment down approximately 17.5%. Our business continues to be impacted by changing consumer patterns, higher interest rates -- could everyone who’s not speaking mute please? Thank you. Higher interest rates, all-time high credit card debt and continued production issues at our OEM customers. And I can tell you VOXX is not alone. Our peers are facing the same issues we are. We are not losing market share and in some areas we're expanding and this bodes well for long term. We've been around for over 60 years for a reason and we remain steadfast in moving forward with our growth plans while at the same time managing our expenses and capital. But near term, with Best Buy, Target, Walmart and many other retailers reporting weaker outlooks for 2023, it's about maintaining and capitalizing opportunistically. As for our Automotive segment, our OEM business was up over 21%, driven by higher volumes with Ford, Stellantis and Nissan for our rear-seat entertainment systems. We have seen some increases in customer production, but not in all cases and chip issues appear to be easing, but we're still being cautious. Margins are tight based on current contract pricing and we are working to mitigate this with production shifts to Mexico, which began in fiscal 2023 and will be mostly complete by the end of our second quarter. Volume remains pretty consistent with Ford and we're continuing to develop the RSE systems for model year 2025 vehicles. Volume with Nissan and Stellantis have picked up somewhat -- with Stellantis -- excuse me. Someone is typing. Please stop. And we're now supplying the EVOLVE system for the Wagoneer and the Cherokee specifically. Let me hold on. Someone is typing, if you can please stop. Thank you. We are now supplying the EVOLVE system for the Wagoneer, the Cherokee and the Pacifica. Curtailing higher growth in the OEM RSE category customer production related issues as some plants have been slowing down for various reasons. On the other hand, chip supply has been improving, which is a good sign for the industry. Looking out, our OEM business remains poised for growth due to a number of reasons. First, the OEM production is becoming more consistent and should increase. Second, the demand for vehicles remains very high. And third, we have a number of large multi-year long-term contracts in place across several of our OEM product lines with new programs coming online in fiscal 2024. The automotive aftermarket continues to be challenged due to a lack of cars and the overall retail environment. There hasn't been much change since I reported last quarter, other than our aftermarket customers working through their inventory positions from the prior year. Dealers and distributors are continuing to watch inventory levels closely as they don't want to repeat the issues they had last year, but we expect things to loosen a bit as we move into the fall and winter seasons. As for our Consumer segment, sales were down roughly 17.5% and was all in Premium Audio, as other CE product sales were up almost 36%. More than half of the growth was in wireless speaker category as we captured sales both in the US and Canada and expanded our Costco program. Germany accessory sales were up over 77% and Schwaiger sales nearly doubled as the new balcony power product we introduced in fiscal ‘23 is doing very well. We expect sales from these two new programs to help offset economic softness and potentially drive growth this year. Premium Audio category has been hit hard and it's not just due to the economy and retailers. We saw a big uptick in Premium Audio sales when COVID first hit and over the following year as people were staying at home and making purchases for their home. Now we're seeing the opposite as discretionary income is being spent on travel, restaurants and other services. The global environment is worse off today than it was at this time last year. On the other hand, the supply chain, which over the past year, has led to significantly higher cost, longer lead times, added storage and shipping and product scarcity has improved dramatically, which should help margins improve. As for the quarter, sales were down across categories, brands and geographies. We spent the past several months, in fact, rather the better part of the past year looking at new opportunities where our premium audio line up could excel and offset some of the global economic pressures, while continuing to drive innovation in our existing lines. One of our new innovations is our Klipsch Reference Premiere powered subwoofers, which are doing extremely well and leading to increased market share. Another is our Gig XL and Gig XXL party speakers, marking our entrance into the hottest category in CE right now with new products slated in the coming months. We will also be launching our new Klipsch Music City portable Bluetooth speaker line which will expand our presence in the category and we've received strong advanced orders that bode well for this category. And lastly, we will be launching a new Klipsch [Ellipsis], a new soundbar coming to market late in the second half of the year. This is a connected audio sound system, the first ever product developed in tandem by Klipsch and Onkyo. The category will continue to be pressured through the year, though new products should help offset the pressures we're expecting as we will expand the distribution of Onkyo and Pioneer related products, especially in China where Pioneer has recently expanded our license. Partnerships are also new sales drivers and there are a few that we believe will help drive growth in the years ahead. Our flagship brand Klipsch is in homes, cinemas, commercial establishments, on the water and soon will be on the road as Klipsch Reference Premiere speakers will be on the first ever Dodge Ram EV truck, two trim levels with the Ram 1500 Tungsten and the Ram REV Tungsten with a state-of-the-art 23 speaker audio system that in fact will blow you away. And we've had a partnership with MasterCraft for years, supplying Klipsch speakers in MasterCraft boats. Soon, Klipsch will be integrated into luxury Crest Pontoon boats and Aviara day yachts, expanding this relationship further. Other programs with Hard Rock, Margaritaville, PGA and others will continue. A few years ago, the premium audio market saw unusually high volume of stay-at-home purchases and an equally fast downturn since. Everyone experienced it, the market will continue to be challenged due to this and the continued slowdown in the economy. New products will help this year. And when market conditions begin to improve, our Consumer segment results will as well. Lastly, our Biometrics segment. Sales of $1 million were in line with last year in Q4 of fiscal 2023, but were light compared to budget due to timing as some projects moved slowly throughout the quarter, but will continue throughout the year and drive growth in fiscal ‘24. We're moving forward with the healthcare programs I've covered for several calls. Our authentication solution was validated by third-party testing and accepted by our customer to be incorporated into their next-generation medication dispensing solution. We're working on any final design changes through the third quarter with production expected start in fiscal ‘24. This customer plans to expand our technology implementation across three other product lines and discussions are underway. We are also working with several pharmaceutical companies selling our logical authentication devices which are used to authorize the proof personnel into their manufacturing execution systems. As you may recall, in Q3 of last year, we developed a proof-of-concept program for a nationwide rental car agency. This program is in testing at Dulles and Reagan Airport and if successful, will roll out in many additional locations. Our business with nuclear power plants in the US continues as well and we are working with several operators throughout the US to deploy EyeLock technology to secure physical access, which should bring our total to 20 nuclear facilities domestically. Within the financial space, we continue to work with Axiom Bank to complete the development of the Iris biometric token for their banking as a service solution and we are also discussing with our largest financial customer, an update to all EyeLock physical access systems that they have installed throughout the years to our newest FXT system. In closing, we anticipate fiscal ‘24 will be difficult due to the uncertainty of the global economy and the continued impact of shifting consumer preferences. We expect markets to remain hard pressed. Many economists are expecting that we'll be in recession in this fourth quarter or first quarter of next year. Therefore, clearly more action is needed. We began adjusting overhead in the second half of last year and given the outlook, we will be making necessary adjustments to our infrastructure and expenditures, adjusting to meet reality. We are completing the move to Mexico to improve all -- overall automotive OEM margins. We are adjusting our workforce based on expected fiscal ‘24 sales volumes and realigning to ensure we're operating effectively and supporting customers. We're actively managing G&A, looking at all expenses both internal and external, and we are implementing brand and product rationalization programs in order to get a better ROI. Although we anticipate near-term softness, some of it should be mitigated by the positives we are seeing and the things we are planning for. As example, improvements in the supply chain should help improve margins. Chip availability should help our OEM customers stabilize production, new OEM programs started next year and beyond. We have new premium audio products set to launch this year. We have begun delivering our new Klipsch party speakers entering the fastest growing segment of the audio business. We'll be expanding geographically with Onkyo, Pioneer and Integra. Premium audio partnerships I discussed are expanding. Our accessory business has been growing with the introduction of our new solar product and expanded distribution. And we have a number of biometric projects which should drive growth and lead the segment to profitability. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Michael, and then we'll open it up for questions. Mike?\nMichael Stoehr: Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. With respect to our first quarter results, all comparisons over the periods ending 05/31/2023 and 05/31/2022, respectively. Total net sales of $111.9 million declined by $16.8 million or 13.1%, with Automotive down $1.2 million, Consumer down $15.6 million, and Biometrics flat. Within Automotive, OEM sales were up $3.6 million and aftermarket sales were down $4.7 million. Within Consumer, Premium Audio sales were down $22.3 million and other CE sales were up $6.7 million. Pat spoke to the drivers for the segments in his remarks, so I'll move on to margins. Gross margin of 24.6% was down 120 basis points for the comparable first quarter periods with Automotive down 120 basis points, Consumer down 190 basis points and Biometrics was immaterial on a gross profit basis. Automotive segment margins were adversely impacted by lower sales of security product and aftermarket remote systems, which traditionally carry higher margins as well as lower margins on some of our current OEM and rear-seat entertainment programs, which we're addressing. Consumer segment margins were down year-over-year, primarily due to lower sales of Premium Audio products. Moving through the fiscal year and as we start cycling through our inventory, coupled with improvements in the supply chain, we should see gross margins increase. Total operating expenses were $39 million, a $1 million or 2.4% improvement for the comparable periods. Selling expenses declined by $1.1 million due to lower commissions, salaries and credit card expenses. Our G&A expenses increased by approximately $400,000, with professional fees and travel expenses higher for the comparable periods. We also had approximately $100,000 increase in restructuring related expenses, associated with the transition of some of our OEM production to Mexico, which as Pat noted, will be mostly complete by the end of this quarter. And our engineering and technical support expenses declined by roughly $100,000. Acquisition costs also declined by $100,000 as these costs were incurred only in the prior year period. As a reminder, the costs relate to the asset purchase agreements signed with Onkyo and the JV with Sharp. We reported our operating loss of $11.4 million compared to an operating loss of $6.7 million in Q1 of fiscal 2023. Total other expenses in Q1 of fiscal ‘24 were $1.6 million, compared to total other expense of $2.2 million in Q1 of fiscal ‘23. Within this, interest and bank charges increased by $800,000, as we had higher borrowings outstanding our facility compared to last year. Equity income of equity investee, which is our fifty-fifty joint venture with ASA Electronics was $1.6 million, essentially flat. And we recorded an expense of $1 million for the interim arbitration award related to the Seaguard arbitration in both fiscal year periods. Other net improved by $1.4 million, primarily due to the positive changes in foreign currency. We reported an EBITDA loss of $7.6 million, compared to a loss of $4.2 million. And we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.9 million compared to a loss of approximately $100,000 when comparing Q1 of fiscal ‘24 and 2023. As of May 31 -- moving on to the balance sheet. As of May 31st, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 million as compared to $6.1 million as of our fiscal ‘23 year end on February 28th. Our accounts receivable decreased compared to fiscal 2023 fourth quarter due to lower sales. And our inventory position increased due to the new products we brought in for our wireless speaker programs and the new solar power product we launched in Germany. We will continue to lower our inventory balances as unconditional purchases are approximately $90 million at the end of fiscal 2024 Q1, compared to approximately $171 million in comparable fiscal ‘23 period. Our total debt stood at $36.7 million as compared to $39.2 million, a $2.5 million reduction. This was principally due to a $3.4 million reduction in the amount outstanding on our debt domestic credit facility, offset by a $1.1 million outstanding on our Euro ABL for VOXX Germany, which was not present at year-end. Our Florida mortgage declined by approximately $100,000, as did the amount owed on the shareholder loan payable to Sharp as part of the joint venture. Total long-term debt, net of debt issuance cost, was $33.9 million as of May 31st as compared to $37.5 million as of February 28. The company has available with senior secured asset-based facility with a committed availability of up to $165 million, with availability as of 05/31/2023 of $71.3 million. Our availability under normal conditions would be higher as this formula takes into account the amortization of the real estate properties in Florida and the Seaguard arbitration. We anticipate a ruling by the court on Seaguard matter to occur on or before August 3rd as we previously communicated and we are preparing for it. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Thomas Forte from -- oops, one moment, please. And our -- pardon me, Thomas. Thomas from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nThomas Forte: Yes. Hi, good morning. So I had a couple of questions, Pat. So can you put the current challenging macroeconomic environment in longer-term perspectives. So going backwards, you kind of have -- the great recession is the most recent example of a recessionary period. I recognize there's a pretty significant recession, but can you compare what you're seeing today with prior recessions such as that one as a starting point?\nPat Lavelle: All right. Well, the first thing is that we did not see -- the big impact that we're having right now is the strong run up in sales when everybody was home. And now we're seeing a major shift in preferences by the consumer. They'd rather be doing more experiential things. So it's a little bit different. A home theater system or a speaker system or some of our bigger products are not something that you buy every two years. So there was a pull forward, a buy forward as we say, when everybody was home. So we're expecting probably another year. As far as the higher end systems, more costly system, it would take to roll through first off the recession and then the pivot. And then -- but it can be offset by some of the new things that we're coming out with. The new [indiscernible] soundbar would be new for us. The party speakers is a fast-growing business. We expect to dominate in that space. So we can offset some of that weakness in the other areas. But I would think that this stretches out through the balance of the year and sometime into next year as well.\nThomas Forte: Okay. That was very helpful. Thank you. And then on the automotive front, can you -- you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but can you explain the current situation? It sounds like the supply chain issues for the most part are in the rearview mirror and that the challenge today is -- I'm trying to understand what the challenge is today if it's not supply chain. Is it also the macro or is it something else?\nPat Lavelle: Well, there's still a little bit of supply chain issues on the chips that were needed. And sometimes chips are used to do other critical things in the vehicles and therefore the chips that they need to do, let's say, rear-seat are taken to use other more critical functions of the vehicle. That's one. The other thing is there is a buildup of inventory with some of our customers and that's changing production forecasts and things like that. Sales may not be as strong as they produce. We are seeing the consumer being impacted by the sticker shock of coming in and buying some new cars. So I think that what we're seeing based on some of the production cuts that we get advised of time to time is a combination of all of it. And I think that the car manufacturers are struggling to meet demand. But at the same time, in vehicles that they are building, they're not seeing the sell through. And I think that will change over time as they adjust with either interest rate reductions or lower prices on some of the vehicles.\nThomas Forte: Okay. And then going back to your original answer, as a long-time follower of the consumer electronics industry, if we had a pull forward and I agree with you that we did, where in the early stages of pandemic, consumers bought a lot of consumer electronics. Do you have historical proxies? Is it just the typical refresh rate for the products and when consumers normally buy the next set, that you're gauging on?\nPat Lavelle: Yeah. I mean, the true audiophiles buy equipment often, okay. But when you look at the impact that COVID had on the buying patterns, like I said, that was in 2020, 2021. And that's why I'm saying, 2022, we started to see it, we'll see it all this year and we'll probably start to improve somewhat as we move into 2024 that you'll start to see normal buying patterns again.\nThomas Forte: Okay. And then last question and thanks for taking all my questions. This I think is a repeat from last quarter, maybe the last two quarters. But as the supply chain costs have improved, can you talk about your strategy on potentially reinvesting some of the improvement in promotional pricing?\nPat Lavelle: Yeah. Well, the thing is that when -- at the height of the supply chain problem, we were seeing what would normally be 30 days on the water. We were experiencing, depending on where the product was coming, as high as 97 days, which means that in order to protect the holiday season and things like that, we had to bring in a lot of excess inventory. And that excess inventory is impacting storage costs and it is preventing us to get -- some of it, not all of it, is preventing us from getting new pricing based on lower cost of freight and in some cases, negotiated better prices for the same product. So we expect that we'll probably see another quarter of inventory being moved out. And everything coming in now would be coming in at lower freight rates and at -- in some cases, better pricing that we've negotiated. So I would estimate that we will see an improvement month over month throughout the balance of the year and then start to get back to historical levels of profitability within the premium space, especially because of the size of the equipment, the freight component was crazy on it. And therefore, now that we're back to pretty much pre-pandemic levels on pricing, that we should see pricing come down. And you will see adjustments to pricing to move out inventory that we want to move and then you'll see adjustment in retail pricing based on lower cost, so we can maintain a competitive nature with our competition.\nThomas Forte: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, Pat. I appreciate it.\nPat Lavelle: You're very welcome, Tom.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Pat Lavelle for closing remarks.\nPat Lavelle: All right. Very good. If there are no further questions, I'd like to thank you for your interest in VOXX, coming on the call today and I wish you a very good day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
