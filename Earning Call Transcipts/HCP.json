With that, let me turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\nDave McJannet: Thank you, Alex, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call for fiscal 2024. We reported solid fourth quarter results that exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with revenues of $156 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15%, and are pleased with our current non-GAAP remaining performance obligations performance which reached $483 million, representing 21% year-over-year growth. I want to start today's call by thanking everyone on the HashiCorp team for the solid fourth quarter close to our fiscal year. Through their hard work, we exceeded expectations in the quarter with important new enterprise logo wins and CRPO growth that demonstrated continued demand for our products as customers trust us with their most important cloud projects. More broadly, based on conversations we had last quarter, we believe that the optimizations that enterprises undertook over the past 18 months are showing signs of abating and we are seeing early signs of reengagement on new cloud initiatives. Our confidence here comes from tangible proof points during the quarter, specifically improving renewal rates and overall better pipeline conversion. This is in line with what we've expected since the start of this cycle, and while there is some ongoing consumption of historical self-managed entitlements among portions of our customer base, the move to cloud is a secular trend with a clearer business need, and there is still a long runway ahead for the largest global enterprises as they mature their cloud efforts. Today, I want to focus on our path to accelerated growth as we enter the new fiscal year. And to be direct, we are behind where we wanted the company to be at this point in our growth cycle and we have work to do. We are on a path back to 20% quarterly revenue growth during FY 2026 and I want to outline the top three initiatives taking place at the company to drive this acceleration. At a very high level, we are moving quickly to improve sales execution, turning the dial even more on commercial differentiation and in Q1, rolling out a plan to reallocate more R&D resources to our cloud products. The first initiative is simplifying our go-to-market strategy, which consists of a more prescriptive go-to-market approach and increased process rigor driven by our president, Susan St. Ledger. We began implementing these initiatives back in -- in the back half of FY24 and are completing the rollout with the field teams this week at our sales kickoff. On the first front, we are shifting from best-in-class standalone products to infrastructure lifecycle management and security lifecycle management. That messaging is finding early traction with our sales teams and potential customers. On the second front, Susan will continue to drive sales process discipline, emphasizing speed, efficiency and simplification in the field while also concentrating our sales investments on additional technical field resources. We saw some early evidence of positive results in our fourth quarter with improved field execution and improved renewals. To give you an example of these efforts, I'd like to discuss a customer that extended from a single product to include a second one of our security offerings, Vault to Boundary in Q4. This software company initially used Vault in conjunction with a homegrown solution to manage and issue one-time credentials for developer access to cloud infrastructure. After facing challenges enabling their R&D team to access their cloud infrastructure in a self-service manner, this customer quickly realized the need to replace their homegrown privileged access management solution. Given the customer's existing deployment of Vault, our field teams were able to show that adding Boundary would provide comprehensive security lifecycle management, reducing time to value. This customer started with just 500 engineers running on Boundary and now expects to grow to over 6,000. We strongly believe the simplified, multiproduct messaging will help us win more deals like these in FY25. The second initiative is about commercial differentiation, greater separation between our commercial and free community offerings. While the ecosystem has clearly standardized on our community edition products, we need to drive more value for our commercial customers. Our product development efforts over the past two years have increasingly been oriented towards enterprise capabilities in our commercial offerings. We are further turning the dial toward commercial differentiation, which we believe will have a positive impact on wind rates and on renewals. One major example of commercial differentiation is Terraform stacks. We gave a preview of stacks at HashiCorp last year, which will bring major new functionality to Terraform and the ability to manage infrastructure estates that span multiple environments. This feature is now in private beta with our commercial customers and will be made available through Terraform Cloud exclusively to our commercial customers later this year. This will drive significant differentiation, especially for our large customers with complex estates. During the fourth quarter, one of our larger land deals on Terraform Cloud demonstrates the power of our differentiated commercial products for customers. A global pharmaceutical company opted to replace their homegrown infrastructure provisioning process built on our community edition with Terraform Cloud. They became a paying customer for the first time because of Terraform Cloud specific features including no code provisioning and the upcoming stacks rollout, as well as our run pricing model update in Q2, which align pricing more closely with their Cloud budgeting process. But in addition to focusing on differentiations through new capabilities, we know enterprise customers have elevated expectations for the life cycle of software that they deploy with a strong preference to minimize production changes. Earlier today, we introduced long term support, or LTS releases, for our commercial customers. The LTS releases enable customers to stay on a supported version for up to two years at a time with the promise to backport critical fixes, security patches, and hardened upgrade paths. Prior to the LTS announcement, customers needed to do regular major version upgrades to remain supported. This provides significant value for customers who want to manage their risk and operational efficiency, and we believe will be another significant driver to land new opportunities and strengthen renewals. The LTS releases will be available with the upcoming versions of Vault, Consul and Nomad. In contrast, users of the community editions will have access to critical updates in the latest version and will have to perform frequent updates to stay current. While we continue to offer innovative technology to the community, our outside focus is on providing value to paying customers. Our prior approach provided the same lifecycle for commercial and community versions and we are now driving a clear differentiation. On that note, our third major initiative is to deliver the enterprise-ready HashiCorp Cloud platform across infrastructure lifecycle management and security lifecycle management. We are seeing strong customer interest for this and are taking steps to expedite our delivery. Our new Chief Product Officer, Michael Weingartner, is focused on Enterprise Cloud delivery and is moving quickly to organize our product development teams to drive Cloud innovation at a faster pace. We have already reallocated resources to this initiative as it is central to an overall companywide shift to lead with our Cloud offerings. As we mentioned last quarter, we are defaulting enterprise land to cloud beginning with Terraform cloud in Q1. As part of this shift, incentives for our field teams are weighted towards cloud rather than self-managed software. We will prioritize enterprise land across infrastructure lifecycle and security lifecycle management with HCP. Landing our customers on cloud first with HCP enables them to realize value faster. As we deliver more cross product experiences, it enhances our ability to drive and extend motion from our core land products as well. As our R&D teams continue to deliver new product innovations having customers on the cloud platform enables customers to use those new capabilities immediately, in contrast to self-managed software which requires planned upgrades. Combined, these facets will drive improved net retention rates over the long term. To show how this works in practice, here's an example of a customer that expanded both Vault and Terraform Cloud in Q4, doubling the size of their initial land deal. This travel agency had experienced significant resource constraints that made it difficult to deploy applications on BareMetal as fast as they needed. They were also dealing with subsidiaries operating at different levels of cloud maturity. As a result, this customer realized that only Terraform Cloud could keep pace with their infrastructure complexity. They standardized on Terraform Cloud not just for its portability and lower operating costs, but also because Terraform Cloud enables them to deploy new applications much faster, improving their competitive positioning. To summarize, our goals for this year are to simplify our go-to-market, expand the differentiation of our commercial products, and shift our business to focus heavily on our HashiCorp managed cloud products. Now, I'll turn it over to Navam to walk through the details of our Q4 and full year performance, forward-looking guidance, and then we will be happy to take any questions. Navam?\nNavam Welihinda: Thank you, Dave, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Echoing Dave's comments, I also want to thank our team for all the effort and continued focus that they have put in, which helped us close fiscal '24 on a positive note. We grew our fourth quarter revenue by 15% year-over-year, our full year revenue by 23% year-over-year, and ended with another free cash flow positive quarter. More importantly, our team put in a lot of work last year to set up HashiCorp for future success and momentum. As Dave mentioned in his remarks, there continues to be pockets of optimization among customers, but the environment in Q4, as well as the outlook for fiscal 2025 from a macro perspective, appears to be better than fiscal '24. As Dave also mentioned, while we are not completely out of the woods on how customers are working through historical entitlements, our renewal rates improved in Q4 compared to Q3, and our pipeline conversion as well as our sales-driven customer activity also improved in Q4 compared to Q3. We believe the combination of abating market headwinds due to consumption optimization, as well as the three operational initiatives of GTM simplification, increased commercial product differentiation and more enterprise-ready HCP cloud offerings, puts us on a solid position to achieve improved bookings in fiscal '25. Given our entitlement model and as we have discussed before, there is a lag between bookings momentum and accelerating revenue growth rates. Our expectation is to see a U-shaped recovery in our revenue growth rates this year, with Q2 being the trough in our revenue growth rates, followed by progressively better revenue growth rates in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We expect CRPO growth rates to follow the trough and recovery pattern with the lowest point of CRPO growth being in Q2 followed by improved CRPO growth rates ending in approximately 20% CRPO year-over-year growth by the end of fiscal '25. As Dave mentioned, we also expect the momentum in CRPO to put us on a path to reach 20% quarterly revenue growth during fiscal 2026. Let's move on to our fiscal '25 guidance and notes. For the first quarter of fiscal '25, we currently expect total revenue in the range of $152 million and $154 million and a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $19 million to $16 million. As a reminder, our business shows seasonal bookings patterns between Q4 and Q1. Q4 is a strong budget flush quarter where we see the highest number of large multiyear contracts. These multiyear contracts create a larger upfront revenue component in Q4 compared to Q1. Our Q1 guidance takes into account this regular seasonality pattern. For the full fiscal year '25, we currently expect total revenue in the range of $643 million and $647 million, and expect fiscal '25 non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $46 million and $43 million. As mentioned in my prior remarks, the quarterly growth rates in the back half of the year are expected to be higher than the full year revenue growth rate. We also currently expect our gross margins to remain strong throughout the year in the low to mid 80% range. We will continue with the measured investment posture we've demonstrated in fiscal 2024, growing expenses slower than revenue growth. We currently expect to achieve non-GAAP operating income breakeven by Q4 of this year. On a final note, as you know, we posted two strong cash flow generating quarters in Q3 and Q4 in fiscal '24. We expect positive free cash flow results during this fiscal year other than in Q2 which has collection seasonality related to seasonal Q1 bookings. We expect to generate cash in all other quarters. Positive free cash flow generation combined with a strong cash balance puts us in a position of having excess cash relative to our operating needs and any potential midterm M&A expected cash needs. We believe HashiCorp has a lot of growth ahead of us and that there is still a lot of runway ahead for the largest global enterprises as they mature their cloud efforts. In addition, we're always responsible in our capital allocation and believe the best use of excess capital is to return it to our shareholders via a share repurchase program. So as outlined in our earnings release today, the board has authorized the $250 million repurchase program to be executed commencing in fiscal 2025. This authorized program is expected to be the first of a continuing program of share repurchases. Our full guidance numbers can be found in our earnings presentation available on our ir.hashicorp.com website under Financials, Quarterly Results. I encourage you to read through the doc for full metric disclosures, share count disclosures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Thanks for your attention. Dave, Armon and I are available to take any of your questions. Alex?\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Navam. With that operator, let's go to our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question today will be coming from Derrick Wood of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. Wanted to just touch on the push to drive enterprises to the cloud. Can you just give us an update as to what the reception has been? Just trying to get a sense whether it's kind of too early to expect a big embracement of cloud at the G2K level, or if you think that could really start to take greater hold and maybe start to drive some higher mix in cloud as we move through the year?\nNavam Welihinda: Hey, Derrick. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, so I think historically, I think we've talked about it before on the calls that predominantly we sold cloud through our corporate segment before, and I think that was driven by both sort of customer appetite as well as platform and product readiness. I think the big shift for us this year, and we're in fact at sales kickoff right now, is that we feel like both of those have changed pretty significantly, right? We're seeing large customers want to adopt Terraform cloud. The platform has matured pretty significantly over the course of the last year, just given the investments we've made there. And so we're shifting to a default posture for our enterprise segment, that's cloud first for Terraform. And with that, we've actually changed sales compensation to incentivize cloud land over self-managed. So, yes, we're feeling very good that both of those things are sort of mature, both from a customer willingness as well as the product readiness.\nDerrick Wood: That's great. If I could, Armon, just a follow-up. Just had a question on the competitive landscape on the security side. Definitely, you've got -- between Vault and Boundary, you've got different competitive dynamics and Microsoft has entered the market with Entra. Just curious whether -- how you see Microsoft competitively and generally how you guys are feeling about win rates?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. I mean what I'd say is we're actually a close partner with Microsoft. We joined the Microsoft Security Alliance as well pretty recently. So we don't see Entra as a competitive offering. We partner with them pretty closely around deep integration between Entra and our products and the HCP platform as well. So certainly much more of a partner play than it is a competitive one. We feel good about our positioning. I think we haven't seen any changes really in the competitive dynamics around those. And in fact, as we're sort of building a more complete offering around both our RADAR product through acquisition as well Boundary, which is an organic build. We feel like we can tell a much more complete story around security life cycle management.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thanks, Derrick. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Hi. Thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the accelerated bookings growth in Q4. And to stay on that point on the improved bookings performance. Dave, was that a function of just stronger execution? Or did you see a better kind of spend environment come through Q4 versus what you saw earlier in the year?\nDave McJannet: Hey, Sanjit, thanks. I think it's -- I think some especially tied to the optimization cycle that I think we've all been talking about for quite some time. I think we certainly felt better in Q4 than it had previously, and that translated into better pipeline conversion rates. Part of that is also execution on the part of the work that Susan St. Ledger has been doing to drive process regulator what we're doing. So I think it's actually the combination of both of those, to be honest. And I would say we're particularly pleased with the work that Susan has been doing, and I speak for the team say we -- I really enjoyed working with her, and that is certainly helping our go-to-market motion.\nSanjit Singh: Awesome. And you laid out a very specific plan and outline on how to reassert 20% revenue growth in fiscal year '26. On the go-to-market side of the equation and you guys have been talking about this for a couple of quarters now. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of changes that are being implemented as you go into sort of sales kickoff and sales process this year? And what does that sort of look like?\nDave McJannet: Yes. I'll put it in maybe a couple of categories. One is around our coverage approach. And the second one is around our overall prescription of motions. On the first topic, we serve the, call it, the 4,000 largest organizations in the world, and that's who we are prioritized and that's where our focus is. And so we've reallocated our resources more specifically to cover those top 4,000. And I think I would -- it's fair to say they were perhaps more dispersed preciously, and we're -- we certainly believe that concentration of investment will improve yield of those teams as to where we expect the revenue to come from. Point number two is the simplification of the go-to-market narrative that we tell in a very, very consistent and simple way. We have a large product portfolio. As we've scaled, there's a challenge in enabling and onboarding reps to be able to tell all the aspects of the stories that we service. And so you've seen us really anchor on two core constructs around the pre-structured life cycle and security life cycle. And to prosecuting that consistently through our large field organization is really the exercise in front of us. So it's really those two things. One is coverage, and the second one is really just the discipline and process. And candidly, that's normal for a companies through this phase of the life cycle.\nSanjit Singh: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question will be coming from Nick Altmann of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys. I wanted to circle back on the last question here just around the go-to-market. But can you maybe just talk about when sort of the go-to-market tweaks and overall simplification will be complete? And then just as a follow-up, how meaningful do you think the go-to-market changes will be versus sort of the overall macro or end market improving?\nDave McJannet: Hey, Nick, thanks for that. Yes, so as it turns out, where our sales kick off right now, and there's tons of excitement about what we're doing here with the team. Obviously, it's always both of those things. The -- in terms of the completeness of our go-to-market tweaks, I think we're materially through that. I think a lot of that work was done in Q3 and Q4 of last year in terms of setting ourselves up for this. And our sales kickoff is ultimately sort of the final moment and that, obviously, from here, it's about execution, but the groundwork has been set. And then overall, in terms of where the improvement it comes from both, obviously. I think we certainly saw signs of optimization abating in the fourth quarter of last year. And while there's still a big OpEx focus from all of the largest customers in the world around their overall software spend, we're optimistic that as the pipeline we're generating now yields into the second half of the year that we'll be in a good position for the second half.\nNick Altmann: Great. And then Navam, any changes to the guidance philosophy. I know historically speaking, you guys have talked about maybe being a little bit more conservative around large deal activity and maybe excluding those from the guidance. So just any updates to the 2025 guidance philosophy? Thanks.\nNavam Welihinda: Relatively similar in terms of the guidance philosophy as it relates to our quarter large deal exclusion. That's what we've factored into the Q1 guide. And as Dave mentioned, we've also factored in what we saw in Q4 and from an optimization perspective. And the effects of that, that will have on pipeline generation and the sales cycle associated with it, which leads to the second half acceleration in the shape of the recovery curve that we talked about in prepared remarks, which gets us back to the 20% growth rate, which we're aiming for.\nNick Altmann: Great. Thanks, guys.\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hey, guys. I'm trying to more clearly put the finger on the driver for the next 12 months versus the following year. Navam, when I listened to your commentary around optimization abating and pipeline improving and conversion rates improving. How much of your fiscal '25 guide is really a reflection of a better environment rather than the three core pillars of improvement that you're talking about? I'm just wondering if all these changes that you're making to go-to-market and commercial differentiation and cloud, are these really more of fiscal '26 contributors rather than fiscal '25?\nArmon Dadgar: Hey, Ittai, this is Armon. Yes, I mean, I think this is a good question. The way I would think about it is the three initiatives that we talked about, as Dave was just mentioning, these are, in some sense, things that have been started and in progress for some of them for quarters, some of them for years, right? So when we think about go-to-market simplification, a lot of that work started upon Susan joining us. And a lot of that foundational work was on Q3, Q4, obviously, rolling out with Cisco and sort of getting finalized. When we talk about the commercial differentiation, that's a dial as we've talked about, that we've been turning for a little while. I think we're continuing to feel the ability to turn that out further with the BSL license changes and other things we put in place late last year. And so we're continuing to sort of shift that dial with net new investments, things like care form stacks that Dave mentioned as well, obviously a major new capability. And then with the policy change today around the introduction of LTS and changes to our backdoor policy. So again, some of these things building momentum on top of changes that were already made. And then with enterprise-ready cloud, again, that was a big focus for us last year. That's why we're feeling good about changing the default motion around Terraform Cloud. And then continuing to invest heavily in enterprise this year. So again, these are not necessarily starting from a cold start on these initiatives. A lot of these, we've been building momentum. We're continuing to put sort of wood behind the arrow. So I think that's clearly a big part of what's going to drive this year and then going into fiscal '26.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. And then with regards to your U-shape pattern of recovery through the year. When I look at some of the important KPIs that you provide net customer additions, 100k customer additions, net dollar expansion rate and even the HCP revenue growth. All of those have not been impressive in the fourth quarter continued to show deceleration. Would the U-shaped comment also apply to those metrics, meaning should we expect total customer additions to accelerate in the second half -- 100k additions to accelerate, net dollar expansion to accelerate, cloud HCP revenue to accelerate?\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. Thanks, Ittai. I think we've commented on what the bookings recovery is expected to look like given what we saw in Q4, which was strong performance from a sales perspective in the results that we saw from a bookings and renewals perspective, right? That's what's baked in. And what will follow is obviously a recovery in all the metrics associated with bookings, revenue growth rates and 10,000 customers. I want to make a point on the customer -- total customer count. A lot of the total customer count for a fair amount of the total customer count delta that you see Q3 to Q4 are self-managed customers or sorry, pay-as-you-go customers, which are very small and don't have a material impact to revenue. So the variations quarter-over-quarter on those customer accounts aren't really material to our revenue. The 100,000 customer count, there's variability quarter-over-quarter. But overall, we're at the top end of where we thought we'd be on 100k customer count for the year. And again, on the sales-driven customer count, we've -- we ended up pretty strong in Q4. So yes, to your questions on how the shape of the recovery and the path to 20% plays out into the underlying KPIs as well.\nIttai Kidron: Great. Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Ittai. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys, can you hear me okay?\nAlex Kurtz: Yes. Yes, we can hear you, Alex.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. So maybe just the first one for me, if I look kind of on Ittai's question about the 100,000 customer adds in the quarter, it felt like you had accelerating bookings but call it a weaker net new 100,000 customer headquarter. So was the outperformance on bookings there, driven by some very large deals that -- some seven-figure deals or some of the largest deals that you've seen? Or what drove that? And then kind of how to think about that?\nDavid McJannet: Yes, Alex, this is Dave. Sure I can answer that one. To be clear, on the 100,000 customer can reiterate what Navam pointed out is that 100,000 customer amount is going to move around quarter-to-quarter, we actually ended at the very, very high end of our guidance for the year in terms of 100,000 customer adds. Quarter-over-quarter, we actually saw a good number of customers landing slightly smaller than 100,000, but just below the threshold, and we fully expect those to graduate up over the next quarter and year as progressive. So actually, I think we feel pretty good about the 100,000 customer number. To your question on the large deal contract. No, there was no significant large deals of note that were unusual for the fourth quarter. I think it was more of a general good Q4 as we had anticipated. Also just underscore Navam's comment on the overall customer count to be super, super clear. We made a pricing change in Q2 of last year, which call some of our pay-as-you-go customers, those customers paying maybe a couple of thousand dollars a year, be able to use our free tier once the end of the year approach. And so the vast, vast majority of that customer count change comes from the matriculation of those older pay-as-you-go customers, credit card customers into a free version of the product. And we fully expect over time they will graduate back to become paying customers as well. So I don't want to misread the customer count in terms of your overall commentary because we actually feel pretty good about it.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. Understood. And maybe just a second question. What level of visibility do you have from kind of the Q4 bookings pipeline because you're guiding to -- this U-shape that you're guiding too you're effectively guiding for growth to double in fiscal '26 based on the trajectory you laid out of reaching 20% by Q2 of fiscal '26. So like is there something that -- like how much of that is you just have to really go get versus leveraging the opportunity that you already have? And what are kind of some of the puts and takes? Is it macro stabilizing, improving because that's quite a revenue growth ramp over the course of the next two years?\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. Let me clear -- this is Navam and thanks for the question. Let me make sure that I clarify a couple of things. So first of all, the Q4 activity is what informs our full-year view, combined with the three initiatives that Dave mentioned which are tailwinds to the operations, right? And the U-shape is meant to imply that there is a shallow dip in recovery, which you should take into consideration as we look into the full-year. And also the back end growth rates are higher than the total year's growth rate just because of the shape of the recovery, right? And then what follows is basically progressive improvement on the growth rate until it reaches 20% in the fiscal 2026 period, not that fiscal '26 will be 20%, just to be clear. So what we're signaling is that -- the fourth quarter was a great quarter, and we feel like the optimization cycle is abating. There are signs of positive activity. We're not out of the woods. And we are doing a lot of work with the three initiatives that we outlined. That's going to have positive impacts to our operations, and that's going to result in positive momentum in terms of growth rates starting in the back half of the year.\nAlex Zukin: All right. Thanks, Alex. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will be coming from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Oh, thank you very much. Navam, just to clarify, you commented that Q2 should be the trough for cRPO growth. Did you say that's also the case for revenue growth? Or are those slightly out of phase? And then just wondering at roughly what levels you see that cRPO growth bottoming out? For instance, should we should we project that forward at mid- to high teens? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. Thanks, Mark. So yes, the cRPO growth rate recovery and the revenue growth rate recovery from a growth rate perspective have similar shapes. There's seasonality related to the cRPO because the booking seasonality front half versus back half. So that has a little bit to play on what the growth rate from a cRPO perspective is. We mentioned how you should think about the exit velocity of cRPO, which is 20% plus -- approximately 20%, sorry, in Q4, which is basically the leading indicator of what we think the revenue growth rates on a quarterly basis into 2026 will be. So that's how we're thinking about the cRPO shape going into this year.\nMark Murphy: Okay. And so you would kind of leave us to our own, I guess, our own guesswork on where the bottom of that you will trough out for Q2. Is that fair?\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, I think the second quarter is the trough, and we expect to see, as I mentioned, the relatively shallow U-shape toughen recovery.\nMark Murphy: Okay. And as a follow-up, maybe for Armon or Dave, where do your customers stand on the topic of multi-cloud adoption at this point? I'm wondering if the insertion of a number of LLMs into the landscape might be causing any more dedication to Azure and OpenAI or more experimentation with Google. Anything that would signify more multi-cloud in customer road maps and then by extension that might be amplifying the HashiCorp value proposition?\nArmon Dadgar: Hey Mark, yes, thanks for the question. I think what you sort of outlined in the question is exactly the type of behavior we're starting to see, which is a lot of customers predominantly maybe had a, I'll call it, a single primary cloud type of strategy. And sort of looked at other clouds potentially secondary or even tertiary when sort of it made sense for them. I think what's changed, to your point is they're looking at leveraging best-of-breed Gen AI technology. And I think that's pulling forward a bunch of road map around how do we go from treating this secondary tertiary cloud into really a much more of a primary cloud environment. So we have access to those sort of best-of-breed capabilities. So in particular, customers who are maybe primarily AWS, looking at leveraging Google and Azure, and maybe customers were primarily Azure looking at leveraging Google as well. So I think it's creating a bunch of that sort of pull forward in terms of customers looking at a true multi-cloud environment. And obviously, for us, this is helpful as it's driving more interest in the tools in terms of how do we have a sort of cloud-agnostic operating model.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nArmon Dadgar: Thanks…\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, next question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Jim Fish of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJim Fish: Hey guys, Thanks for the questions. Maybe first, Dave or Armon for you. Any pipeline benefit on the security side, given we're seeing boards essentially give the approval for security budgets and seeing strength in security budgets overall and focus on identity protection. Is that a large reason why the pipeline is as strong as it is that you're relaying to us? And when do you expect the Windows and remote functionalities to be available in order to go toe to toe with sort of the 600-pound gorilla in that space?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes, thanks for the question. I think we are seeing relative robustness on pipeline in the security space. And I think even last year, I think that was probably the case that it held up better than maybe other budgets just given how top of mind cyber is for most organizations. And the other thing that's been helpful is as we're sort of filling in the portfolio and going from really sort of stand-alone to more of a true security life cycle, as Dave mentioned with sort of boundary and RADAR is allowing us to position a more compelling portfolio offering around sort of a full security life cycle. As to the second question around Windows and RTP, that's a big focus for us this year within boundary. We think realistically, that's going to be more back half weighted to flush out the capability to make sure it's fully mature.\nJim Fish: Makes sense. And Navam, for you on the guide, can you just help us frame how you're thinking about the balance of new business here versus the recovery in your expansion rate? And are you seeing on the difference between cRPO and long-term RPO growth this quarter? Is it just you're seeing shorter duration deals with the existing base or just continued lower usage? Thanks.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. I don't think there's been a bunch meaningful change in terms of the weighted average duration of our contracts at this point in the fourth quarter. We are seeing smaller land sizes. And as we mentioned, over the last year, we saw an elongation in the land cycle leading to year-over-year declines in the absolute value of land combined with more land deals. So more contracts landing with more customers, but at a smaller size. So those expand and extend over time. So the 2025 guide is basically predicated on expand extend versus a big land change from a revenue perspective. But we are expecting improvements in both.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Yes, hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just want to ask on the renewals. I know you made some comments on that. Are you seeing customers still being pretty cautious on renewals because they underconsumed entitlements over the last 18 months or so? And then can you just remind us what's the incentive for someone to expand on a renewal if they can just under commit and then true things up as time goes on? Is there a penalty there? Anything -- any kind of additional details on how that would work if somebody actually over consumes relative to their entitlements?\nDavid McJannet: Hey Jason, it's Dave. Thanks for the question. On the first one, yes, it's a good point. I mean, you've got to keep in mind that this optimization cycle is now several quarters in and you're starting to anniversary some of the entitlements that people had already right tied on their renewals. So yes, to a degree, I think that's one of the aspects of our point of view, which is that this optimization cycle is showing signs of abating. And certainly, that plays out in NDE over time and pure down renewal to the extent that people haven't consumed their entitlements, but there's probably a little bit of ways to go still. I think that's implicit in our guidance, but it's certainly much better and we're now lapping previous period where it starts to look more favorable. In terms of your second question, we don't -- there was not an immediate incentive for people to true up at the moment they expand. That generally is done on the renewal of the contract. You got to keep in mind is the scale of the organizations we work with is that is just the typical enterprise buying behavior. So you do not necessarily see that expansion until the renewal of that contract given the title nature of things. Again, unlike consumption models we sell entitlement. And so there is just this natural lag as the market starts to recover.\nArmon Dadgar: Maybe the one thing, Jason, I would add there is the sort of your question on what's their incentive for under committing in that sense. It's that the BDP discounts they would get committing to a lower threshold would be lower, right? So customers will realize better pricing by committing to a higher dollar amount. So that's the incentive.\nJason Ader: So is there a possibility that as we kind of come out of all of this, there's going to be -- on the renewals, let's say, in FY '26, there's going to be sort of a bump because there's going to be a true-up element because customers were more cautious on their prior renewal, do you see what I'm saying?\nDavid McJannet: Yes, I don't think we have a real point of view that far out. I do think this is implicit in the NDE rates that we've seen previously as people sort of on the renewals expanding substantially. And obviously, we've been in a par where that hasn't been happening and at some point, it will revert.\nJason Ader: Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: All right, thanks Jason. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will be coming from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much, team. I'm curious to spend a little bit of time, if I don't mind, Dave, thank you read out a bunch of things that Susan is going to be doing to the go-to-market organization. It came across as being very substantive -- at the same time, it also went through very quickly. Can you expand upon what exactly is going to be the new bent to go to market? And the measures that Susan is adopting, what are they meant to remedy versus the approaches in the past? And how important is this? Because the product we've always appreciated the product strength of HashiCorp it's been the key asset for the company. Just trying to understand incrementally the tweaks to go to market what are they really addressed? And what are they really motivated by so we can all understand the shape of this recovery? Thank you so much.\nDavid McJannet: Kash, sure. Happy to double-click on that a little bit. Just to reiterate, really, the first substantive change that we introduced over the last 6 months, was a refocusing of our go-to-market resources on a slightly smaller number of accounts. I think that's point number one. Obviously, we have been in a very aggressive investment phase coming out of our IPO. And as the market environment changed, we obviously had to remedy the fact that we had a lot of resources now allocated in places where perhaps we've gone through relatively quickly. So now we hold those resources back to focus on the most important accounts and that is certainly paying dividends, and it's the appropriate thing to do. Point number two, I think it's worth actually just contextualizing where sort of as you evolve from the early adopters of the world to the early majority, how you have to engage with them in a much more prescriptive manner. Again, that's the consistent pattern of this particular part of the growth arc of any company to get to this kind of customer base, which is the early majority, our go-to-market motions are now much more prescriptive in their nature, both for our customers in terms of how we engage with them, which is we go talk to about more of a solution-oriented conversation around life cycle. And then number two, it's much more process rigor, which is, again, just the nature of scaling this the side of the organization. So I don't think -- I wouldn't say that changes are massively substantive. It's much more process-oriented to help get more consistency in growth as we hit this particular scale inflection point. And the first one is just really about reallocation of resources, which have gone slightly extended as we grew.\nKash Rangan: Got it. And one follow-up for Navam. When I look at the sequential total subscription revenue growth rate. I mean it was the highest we've seen in several quarters. I'm wondering if you could double-click on that because if I just annualize that sequential growth rate, you get to a better growth in what you're guiding to, maybe there's some onetime effects in Q4 sequential subscription revenue. I also look at the sequential change in current RPO, roughly $62 million or so again, the highest we've seen in several quarters. Can you help us understand what might be driving that Q4? It looks like some of the leading indicators look good and some don't like to know customer count is a little bit on the slugger side. But certainly, these caught my attention, I just wanted to see if you could offer more perspective.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. Thanks, Kash. And absolutely. I mean we saw pockets up optimization, which relates to some of the 100,000 numbers and customer numbers that you saw. But from a broad perspective, Q4 was a great quarter as it related to the performance we saw from a rent perspective and a cRPO perspective. Now it's important to keep in mind that there is seasonality in the business in the fourth quarter, particularly in the back half of the year and specifically in the fourth quarter, where these are larger quarters compared to Q1, for example. So there is a seasonal aspect to Q4 versus Q1. But for the most part, we saw positive signs, which we reflected in our prepared remarks and which also was the basis for how we were thinking about the growth recovery and our path back to sort of a 20% quarterly revenue growth rate sometime in the 2026 period. So yes, we're optimistic about the early signs we're seeing. A - Alex Kurtz Great. Thanks, Kash. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment. And our next question will be coming from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the emphasis on security. You called it out a couple of times here, both as a separate -- focus on go-to-market and also on the commercial differentiation. How should we read that? Are you identifying that as kind of a core use case beyond provisioning with Terraform? In other words, our customers, do you see line of sight for customers potentially landing with security or Terraform and then the expansion opportunity kind of unfolds from there?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes, Brad, thanks for the question. As we've talked about a lot, we really have two core products, obviously, Terraform, which we think about as sort of the key landing point when we talk about infrastructure life cycle management starts with provisioning, and there's a sort of a broader portfolio around that. When you think about -- sort of second land product, it's very much the beachhead within the security life cycle story that we've held, right? So those have always been historically the land business. They make up the majority of the revenue. I think what you're seeing is an evolution from telling sort of a point product story around those into really simplifying that solution story that Dave talked about. So that our field isn't able to go talk about we're not just solving a secret management problem while we're solving a security life cycle. We're the beachhead, but really that brings in things like our radar product for secret scanning, detection and inventory and then brings the boundary as well for the privileged access management for the human access. So it's really about moving from sort of telling that point product story into a broader solution, but it's not a dramatic shift all has always been a land product for us and is a significant revenue contributor.\nBrad Sills: Understood. And then if I could also ask for a bit more detail on some of the process efficiencies that you've identified for areas of improvement. Dave, you mentioned speed in the pipeline velocity in the pipeline is a focus some technical resources to kind of back that up that you're putting into play here. Would just love to get more details on how you're thinking about some of the tactical things to improve process discipline?\nDavid McJannet: Brad, I think this is -- I guess I'll just bring it back to just the operational opportunities for us to improve as we scale. We're here at our sales kick off again, reiterating this through our growing sales organization. And so the process is just really about process consistency and things that yield faster and higher win rates. There's a whole litany of things that are operational in their nature. And I think it's just, again, the nature of where we are, it's how do we do this consistently across the world in every geo in the same way, and this is just normal operational day-to-day element. And I certainly feel so we're good about it. I think the fact that Susan St. Ledger has been now in place for a couple of quarters. I have to remind us that she has been part of a couple of different companies going from the $600 million scale to the $1 billion plus, and that's certainly what it takes to do so, and we're super bullish about the work she’s doing.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you, Dave.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from of BTIG. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Chevron for Gray Powell. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to circle back on Terraform stacks. Can you provide any insights or statistics on that product? And then when it goes officially GA, how should we think about that accelerating the free to pay like this year and going into next?\nArmon Dadgar: Great. Thanks, Trevor. Yes, so the way I would think about Terraform snacks is, effectively, it can almost call it the Terraform 2.0. It's the biggest enhancement we've added to Terraform since it was introduced -- and effectively, what it does is enhance Terraform's ability to manage multiple environments and multiple layers of the infrastructure stack at the same time, right? So prior to the stacks, customers have to sort of manually build process around how to handle multiple environments. For example, development and testing, staging production. So there was a manual process and manual orchestration around that versus with stack, we now have a native understanding and a native ability to or across those multiple environments. For our particular customer base, this is most impactful to those kind of 4,000 biggest customers they've talked about. They all have very large, very complex infrastructure. And so we think this is going to be a compelling set for them. And in fact, already, we're seeing great resonance with the folks in private beta using this capability already. So the decision we've made is really to bring that only to the commercial customers through Terraform Cloud to begin with. And so to your second part of your question on free-to-paid conversion, effectively, it won't be available in the pure-play community addition. You will have to start on the commercial products to leverage stacks, right? So obviously, at the very bottom end we have a free tier that allows some limited scale usage by adding substantial scale usage where you have to be on one of our commercial tiers of Terraform product.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will be coming from Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you taking my question I wanted to zone in on the sales motion that will emphasize more of a cloud-first approach into your enterprise and very large customer base. I wanted to get a better understanding how much of this will involve the conversion of an existing Terraform environment into cloud form factors? And how much of this is really going to be emphasized and focused around the expansion and extension of self-managed enterprise overall Hashi footprint into the broader portfolio of solutions? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. Thanks, Fatima. Yes, it's a great question. So effectively, the sales comp change that took place is really to emphasize land deals on Terraform Cloud. Now that said, obviously, we're engaged with customers on a renewal basis as well. It's obviously in our interest to move them to Terraform Cloud. It's also in the customer's interest. I think they realize features much more quickly. They don't have to do upgrades. They're not on the hook operationally. So there's a lot of benefits to the customer from moving from self-managed to cloud. But similarly for us, we get better visibility into the usage, lower cost of support and ability to deliver innovation to them more quickly. So the sort of process changes are really around incentivizing land, obviously, there's strong incentives on the expansion side as well. And then our view as ones people are part of the cloud platform that simplifies our ability to drive the next product along because they're already on an integrated chassis.\nFatima Boolani: I appreciate that. And just as it relates to one of the bundles and the more storytelling approach on the go-to-market front. So you did introduce the Dura Trust bundle last year, I'd love to get an date on how much traction that's gotten vis-a-vis maybe penetration in the base. And to the extent there are other logical bundles that you could create to build that transaction velocity and enhance that expansion and extension momentum, especially since you're incentivizing the land deals on cloud. So shortening that expansion sales cycle -- into other solution areas like boundary or taker and way point? That’s it from me thank you.\nDavid McJannet: Yes, it's Dave. Thanks for the question. Yes. So I think the simple way to describe it is the -- we effectively have two conversations we have. One is infrastructure life cycle, one is on security life cycle. We previously had this Zero Trust SKU bundle, which has essentially been replaced by the security life cycle form factor, which gives you access to multiple products within the security portfolio. So yes, we have actually recognized the success of that to some degree and institutionalize that as a default selling motion for security life cycle management, and then also introducing that infrastructure life cycle management. So we're really trying to simplify the structure of what our field teams have to bring to bear, and we're certainly optimistic that, that simplicity will drive better yield.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Next question, please. And I think we have to limit to one question just a matter of time that we've left here. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will be coming from Matt Dezort of Needham. Your line is open.\nMatt Dezort: Hi, this is Matt on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to double-click on the HCP cloud chassis. Is Terraform still generating the lion's share of that revenue stream so far as customers move to fully managed? Or is Vault making a move? And how is that composition expected to change over the next 12 months and into fiscal '26?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. Thanks, Matt. So today, actually, both Terraform and HCP are significant contributors to the cloud revenue line. I think what we expect this year is given the shift we're making towards providing a sales incentive around landing with tariff cloud we expect that there'll probably be some differential increased land on Terraform and then looking at basically evaluating whether a similar thing would make sense back half of the year for Vault. But again, I think this is where we look at customer appetite and there's slight differences given the run time nature of Vault. There's a little bit more customer apprehension versus something slightly less onetime critical like Terraform. So we're going to take a little bit of a wait and see on customers. But yes, I think near term, we'll see more Terraform.\nMatt Dezort: Thanks.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Matt. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will be coming from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Mark on for Brad. Want to see if you could provide a little detail on the linearity in the quarter and the macro improvement, the, I guess, optimization abatement that you guys talked about and how that's sustained through February, and how that contributed to kind of your confidence for the guide for both FY '25 and '26? Thanks.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. Just a reminder, we're subject to regular enterprise patterns, which means that there is linearities more towards the back half compared to the front half of both the year and Q4 was stronger than expected from a linearity perspective. And as I mentioned earlier, all positive signs from a macro perspective and how the optimization cycle is playing out.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks.\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will be coming from Ari Terjanian of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nAri Terjanian: Hi, all. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quick on RPO. What percent of lands in the quarter were the cloud, HSP Cloud? And then do you think -- is there any potential pull forward ahead of comp plan changes for this year?\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. There was nothing unusual that happened in the fourth quarter compared to the other quarters. So nothing in terms of unusual activity there.\nAlex Kurtz: All right.\nNavam Welihinda: Thanks.\nDave McJannet: Thanks, Ari.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nDavid McJannet: I'd just like to thank everyone and express my thanks for the participation for everyone who is able to attend. And we certainly appreciate all the questions. We look forward to speaking to everybody soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker today, Alex Kurtz, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kurtz: Good afternoon, and welcome to HashiCorp's fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings call. This afternoon, we will be discussing our third quarter fiscal 2024 financial results announcing our press release issued after the market closed today. With me are HashiCorp's CEO, Dave McJannet; CFO Navam Welihinda; and CTO and Co-Founder, Armon Dadgar. In conjunction with our earnings press release, we have published an earnings presentation that provides additional financial information about our quarter, we encourage you to review that presentation in advance of our call. You can access it on our investor website at ir.hashicorp.com. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements, which are made under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning financial and business trends, our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full 2024 fiscal year. These statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek or will or similar statements. These statements reflect our views as of today only and should not be relied upon as representing our views at any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any duty to update these statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. During the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The financial measures presented on this call are prepared in accordance with GAAP, unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as how we define these and other metrics is included in our earnings press release, which has been furnished to the SEC and is also available on our website at ir.hashicorp.com. With that, let me turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\nDave McJannet: Thank you, Alex, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for fiscal 2024. We reported solid third quarter results that exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with revenue of $146 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17%. Current non-GAAP remaining performance obligations reached $421 million, representing 23% year-over-year growth, and we added 26 customers with greater than or equal to $100,000 in annual recurring revenue to reach a total of $877 million. Our HashiCorp Cloud Platform offerings reached $19.9 million in revenue, representing 14% of subscription revenue in the quarter. The team performed well under difficult circumstances with continued new large customer wins despite sustained deal scrutiny that's a result of the broader macroeconomic environment. Coming out of our annual user conference in October of this quarter, we remain convinced about the long-term opportunity ahead of us as the world's largest enterprises move to the cloud. With that as a backdrop, I want to talk today about what we're doing both short term and long term to fully realize this opportunity. HashiCorp is positioned as an enabler for the cloud makes us unique. At HashiConf in October, we had more than 1,200 in-person and 12,000 virtual attendees and hosted keynotes with customers such as Home Depot and Unity Games. The size of our community and the variety of customer use cases on display at HashiConf underscore that we have a large long-term opportunity that touches multiple facets of cloud infrastructure. At HashiConf, we unveiled multiple new product advancements aimed at enabling both developers and platform teams with workflow automation capabilities and lifecycle management. We announced HCP Vault Secrets. A good example of how our continued investment in cloud capabilities is expanding our portfolio and also have a preview of HCP Vault Radar, which is based on the secret scanning startup we acquired earlier this year. We also made several announcements related to Terraform, the industry standard for infrastructure as code. I think attendees and users were most excited about Terraform Stacks, a major investment and enhancement to the Terraform execution engine. We also announced our first generative AI feature within Terraform, which uses LLM to generate module test for users. Additionally, we announced the private beta of HashiCorp Developer AI, an AI-powered companion for finding reference materials, architectural guidance and product examples from the HashiCorp Developer Portal. You'll also continue to see us being targeted about incorporating AI capabilities into our products over time. We're being thoughtful about what AI use cases are valuable to our customers and are proceeding deliberately. However, you will continue to see investments across our portfolio with a focus on lifecycle management capabilities across infrastructure and security. As I mentioned earlier, it's no secret that market conditions remain difficult. While there are many things we cannot control, there are many others we can. So we've taken steps to help us with both near-term performance and meeting the long-term opportunity ahead of us. First, we are focused on simplifying our go-to-market messaging and strategy. At our Financial Analyst Day, we introduced new messaging centered on lifecycle management, which we apply to both our infrastructure and security offerings. This helps our sales teams more easily position key parts of the HashiCorp product portfolio as comprehensive solutions to common problems and package them together. Susan St. Ledger, our President of Worldwide Field Operations, is key to this go-to-market approach, and she is already having an impact with new leadership hires and enablement efforts to our field teams. With our help, our field teams will be better positioned to execute on this new strategy while also putting additional focus on our cloud offerings. This investment in our go-to-market is aligned with the investments in our products I mentioned earlier, and together, they will help us to continue to win and expand within the Global 4000. Second, it's worth noting that these go-to-market efforts are also crucial to our ongoing focus on building a wholly integrated offering around the HashiCorp Cloud Platform. These cloud-managed products are a fast-growing part of our business, as you can see in our results. Through HCP, these products can be sold and consumed more easily with simplified opportunities for product expansions and extensions, and we can better respond to changing customer needs. We are already seeing positive responses to the new cloud pricing frameworks we introduced earlier this year. Finally, we remain focused on increasing efficiency and are committed to creating further operating leverage in our business. Those efforts are already underway, and we are making good progress on our path to profitability. Navam will discuss those in more detail. These efforts do not alter our ability to build new products, as you can see from the broad set of announcements we made at HashiConf. Now I'll turn it over to Navam to walk through the details of our Q3 performance and then I'm happy to take any questions.\nNavam Welihinda: Thank you, Dave, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Echoing Dave, I also wanted to reflect on how great it was to host everyone at our user conference, HashiConf last quarter. It was amazing to see the energy our community, customers and employees created at this event. I also wanted to extend a big thank you to those who joined us in person or virtually and to all employees who worked hard to make this event of success. During HashiConf, we also hosted a Financial Analyst Day, where we talked about two key fundamental focus areas for us financially. First was the focus on customer count momentum; and second was the focus on cost efficiency. On the customer count focus, our team continues to simplify our go-to-market approach, resulting in continued momentum on our net new customers at our over 100,000 in ARR. We added 79 net new customers at or above 100,000 in ARR year-to-date. Given this progress, we remain well on track against our goal of adding 80 to 100 customers over 100,000 in ARR per year. As you may know, our 100,000 ARR customers are foundational to our model, and they have a high growth potential as a group and provide a significant portion of our current revenue as well as our future revenue potential. Customer bookings in the third quarter played out largely as we expected. It was a seasonal quarter with unchanged macro buying behavior from most customers, very similar to what we experienced during the first half of FY '24. The buying behavior led to smaller land contracts and smaller expansion and extension contracts. Despite the contracts being smaller, we saw growth in the number of contracts we engaged in with our customers. On the efficiency focus, I want to announce a significant corporate milestone for the company. We reached both a positive non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter and a positive free cash flow this quarter. The milestone is an important step towards our goal of non-GAAP operating profit by the back half of next year. We expect free cash flow to be positive from this point forward other than in Q2, which is a seasonal low free cash flow period for us due to booking seasonality. Before moving on to guidance, I wanted to briefly revisit our approach to the financial outlook. We are confident in the company's long-term positioning especially after the positive customer conversations we had with many of our larger customers during and after HashiConf about the new innovation we are bringing to the market. In the shorter term, we remain judicious in our guidance approach given the demand environment and how that impacts our sales cycles and contract size with our larger customers. We will continue our assessment of the demand environment and provide guidance for next year as customarily do in the next earnings call. Our full guidance numbers can be found in our earnings presentation available on our ir.hashicorp.com website under financial's quarterly results. I encourage you to read through the dock for full financial metric disclosures, share count disclosures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. To summarize our guidance, for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, we expect total revenue in the range of $148 million to $150 million and a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $16 million to $13 million. For the full fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue in the range of $576 million and $578 million and expect FY '24 non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $89 million and $86 million. Thanks for your attention. Dave, Armon and I are available to take any of your questions. Alex?\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Navam. With that, operator, let's go to our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the positive free cash flow and the positive non-GAAP EPS. When I look at the results, though, I don't think you guys have been pretty clear about this that I haven't really seen any improvement yet in sort of buying behavior and the broader macro backdrop. And as you guys sort of look to simplify the sales motion, which you guys are very clear about at the investor session, I was wondering to get a sense of how you feel, or how long do you think it'll take to see returns on these go-to-market investments and some of the changes you're making to go-to-market. Is this something that's going to have to play out through the balance of next year, or is next year a period where we could see growth start to bottom and potentially accelerate?\nDave McJannet: Hi Sanjit. Thanks. This is Dave. I'll answer that one. I think the way that we think about it is we're clearly coming out of a period of aggressive investment in software in the Global 2000 for the last couple of years. And what's clear is that cohort of companies is digesting the entitlement that they have purchased. And you see that in the net dollar retention numbers of us and others in our peer group. And I think that's the significant aspect of the demand environment that we're speaking about. On the positive side, the consumption vendors and the cloud vendors who obviously have consumption-based models are indicating stabilization and that's positive for the entire ecosystem, and you would expect that to flow through to the entitlement vendors over the course of the next several quarters. I think what we do see, certainly, we're excited about the simplification we're bringing to bear. And we already see, as Navam highlighted, demand for our products remains consistent. Deal volumes, as Navam indicated, are as high as ever. Our win rates are as consistent as ever, and we're not seeing any changes to the discounting behavior in our field. We're just seeing smaller land and expand activity from our customers. So super optimistic about the longer arc and do think that simplification we're bringing to bear will help.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the thoughts, Dave. And then, Armon, just love to get an update on boundary, and how you see the demand funnel building for that offering.\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. Thanks Sanjit. So over summer, I think there's two fairly significant announcements. One was our introduction of session recording and the second was the introduction of the boundary self-managed enterprise product. And I think what we've seen since then is a pretty healthy construction of pipeline, we have major enterprises that we're engaged with, a few of which talked at HashiConf, folks like ManTech, major FSI partner, as well as EQ Bank talking about how they've adopted boundary in their environments and continue to be excited about the pipeline that we're seeing building and the opportunity around boundary.\nSanjit Singh: Awesome. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nAlex Kurtz: All right, Sanjeev. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to ask sort of high level, what in the last 90 days has occurred that gives you the most optimism for 2024.\nNavam Welihinda: Do you want to answer that Armon?\nArmon Dadgar: Sure. Yes, Jason, happy to. This is Armon. I think a few things. I think one was we were pleasantly surprised that as of this last quarter, we officially have more cloud contracts than we have self-managed. And I think for us, that's a really exciting sign in terms of just where we're seeing the demand shift towards the cloud platform versus self-managed. And obviously, that's sort of weighted towards the commercial customers today. But I think equally, we're starting to see that shift now happen where in the larger enterprise customers are signaling their willingness to move. And particularly for the -- for management products like Terraform, I think we're seeing increased demand to move those to cloud. And so for us, that's optimistic as we think about next year and going into really pushing more heavily on cloud where we feel like we can start to shift towards Terraform Cloud as a default motion for our land rather than self-managed are form, which historically has been driven by just customer appetite and interest.\nJason Ader: Anything else you said there was a few things.\nArmon Dadgar: I think it's those few, right? It's the tip of the cloud to being -- we have more contracts on cloud than we have on self-managed. I think it's the enterprise willingness to move to cloud as well.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you very much.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks Jason.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. A couple of questions for me. First for you, Navam. RPO, if my math is right, has now grown faster than revenue for about four quarters in a row that needless to say, now the relationship that can stay. So help me understand why did the disconnect has existed for such a long time? And when would you expect this to converge or reverse? That's number one. And for you, Dave, you've talked about in the past how your progress through the year is really a reflection of budgets set late in the previous year, hence, that was the reason why you didn't see a slowdown in your business activity at the beginning of the slowdown a couple of years ago. As you have conversations with customers here and now about '24, and maybe this is asking Jason's question in a different kind of a way. What are they telling you about budgets for '24? What is it that you're hearing about how '24 can shape up directionally from a spend standpoint relative to '23? Thank you.\nDave McJannet: Maybe I'll answer your second question first. It's Dave. I think the short version is we just have to be focused on Q4 for now. That's really where our attention is. But I would say -- to add to what Armon indicated previously, I put back to our contract volumes being very, very healthy, very, very positive, notwithstanding the ASP changes as you can understand, based on the digestion process that's going on inside of our existing customers, particularly. And then number two, I will just add that our product downloads are at a record high, and that certainly gives us confidence that the trends continue unabated. What we're just working through is the budgeting cycle. And so we'll see how Q4 works out, but certainly ample optimism about the what comes over the longer arc.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, Ittai, I'll cover your RPO question. We're very pleased with the RPO growth. It signifies basically that our customers are through this vendor consolidation period. Our customers are entering into longer-term contracts with us, meaning spanning multiple years and placing their faith in us in our products. So that's obviously a big positive for us, and we're seeing continued momentum in is the more relevant one as it connects to revenue over the next 12 months. So that's a closer proxy for revenue. And obviously, we keep a close eye on that, and we're seeing reasonably good growth rates on the CRPO side as well. In terms of convergence, we -- our view of revenue, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks is want to take a very measured view until the time that we see the buying behavior and the macro change. And we haven't taken a different view as to how we forecast the next quarter and how we think about the future. So it's been consistent with the prior period's forecast.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Ittai. Next question.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could talk through the AI issue with us a little bit to understand the mechanics around how enterprises are adopting it versus their alternative uses of investment. It seems to me that there's two possible solutions here. One would be that you would it would drive app development and internet as -- excuse me, infrastructure's code content and demand as a result, or it could slow app development as they spend time ascertaining the value of how to use it and how to integrate it into their programs. So can you talk a little bit about those two alternative worldviews?\nArmon Dadgar: Sure. Yes. I mean I can share certainly what we're seeing in the customer conversations that we're having. Our general sense is that there's a lot of excitement certainly among people about -- if nothing else, at least being able to dip their toes in and being able to access these models, start leveraging them, being able to sort of see how they could apply to people's businesses. And so because of the specialization of these models, in the different cloud providers. We've seen this as actually a tailwind for many customers to actually go towards a multi-cloud strategy, right? They might have been single CSP or might had a large percentage of the workload on-prem, and this has been a driver for them to accelerate either going multi-cloud or going to cloud to begin with, so that they can leverage that because I think most customers realize they won't have access to certain best-of-breed capabilities and certainly, if they're stuck on-prem. So I think in that sense, it has been an accelerator in terms of customers pulling forward some of that strategy. On the flip side, I think we're also seeing a general interesting opportunities across the portfolio. We did talk at our Financial Analyst Day about a very large financial company we work with, the invested in Nomad to build a large-scale compute grid based on thousands of GPUs and really looking at how do they leverage these techniques at scale in a cost-effective way. And we've seen that playing out driving interest across the portfolio, certainly Terraform for provisioning [Nomad] for doing large-scale workload orchestration and console for enabling networking across a multi-cloud estate. So I think it's certainly been a useful tailwind for us.\nAlex Henderson: So you don't see any slowdown in the app development cycle. So that brings me to the second part of the question, which is we've gone through the year of efficiency over the last 18 months. more than a year now. And that obviously cleaned up a lot of wasteful cloud infrastructure. It seems likely that those teams are now shifting away from that thought process of how do I fix the waste that I've got to how do I keep it from happening again in the future. And to that extent, I would think that Terraform would prove to be one of the key tools that would be used to produce a standardized model to manage resources in the cloud. Where are we on that changeover and how do we think that will play out over the next 18 months? Is it a very shallow slope to recovery? Is it a longer process, or is it something that could actually reaccelerate the growth outlook?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. It's a really great question. And the observation I would share is, and you've heard us probably talk about this at a few different events, is we almost characterize an organization's adoption of cloud is going through multiple phases, right? Phase 1, we tend to think of as call it almost an ad hoc approach, right? Multiple application teams are all sort of lit up to go build their applications in cloud. But with no sort of standardized process, workflow, center tooling, et cetera, it's everything sort of free for rolling. And I think what ends up happening is there's different catalysts. For some organizations, it might be a security issue for others, it's a compliance issue, for others, it's a cost issue. But at some point, there's a catalyst for an organization to say, you know what, this is unsustainable. We actually need to get to a Phase 2 where we look at a more mature organizational approach, where we have a centralized platform team that creates a standard set of process, standards set of tooling, put some guardrails around it, both from a cost perspective, security compliance perspective. And that Phase 2 tends to then be where organizations really unlock cloud adoption at scale, right? Because now they have the controls in place to really scale, and so I think to your point, I think your observation is exactly right. What this year of optimization has done is basically pull forward that Phase 2 in the construction of the platform team across a broad swath of customers that we certainly interact with, right? So I'd say we've I think that for us is a great tailwind because ultimately, those platform teams are our customers.\nAlex Henderson: If that's the case, is it then causing a pull-in in the time to reaccelerate mean that's the conclusion.\nArmon Dadgar: I think what it's doing is it's creating a central -- ultimately, these are the groups we sell to, right? So yes, it makes it easier for us over the long term to build a relationship with these platform teams and then ultimately, drive our expand and extend motion, to grow usage of the land product and ultimately sell them the rest of the portfolio.\nAlex Kurtz: Yes, we have a bunch of questions left to go, so we're just going to move along a little bit and please just limit to one question for now, and we'll try to get more answers later. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. And congrats on the nice free cash flow generation. I'm wondering, Dave, if you detect any difference in the demand environment or willingness to invest in November or December being that we're on the heels of softer inflation, strong GDP growth. There's been very favorable interest rate movements. As you noted, there's optimization moderation being seen by consumption software companies and stock market kind of breaking out and moving higher. I'm just wondering if any of that is kind of translating into your dashboard at this point.\nDave McJannet: Thanks Mark, yes, I think you're exactly right on the correlation of the consumption models and the lag for the entitlement models, I think, as you pointed out in the past. And so generally speaking, you saw from some of the consumption models commentary about improvement. I think for us, we sort of have to wait until the quarter progressed a little bit more to be able to make much of a commentary. I think as ever, there's tremendous interest for what we do, getting through the procurement departments becomes the question. And I think that is always the wildcard. I would say too early to tell based on the last month or -- as we indicated, our deal volumes in Q3 were as Navam indicated, higher than ever. Our win rates were consistent. Our discounted practices are no different. So we're certainly optimistic that that continues.\nMark Murphy: And then - thank you, Dave. Navam, just as a quick follow-up on the model considerations. When I look at the RPO, I mean, I see it kind of -- I see softness there. I see it sort of falling off trend. I just mean sequentially, it's still quite good year-over-year. Is there anything notable there in terms of were there any down sells? I mean cancellations, you said they were not pricing concessions, but there were some moving pieces with all the open two food stuff. Was there anything unusual that might have impacted that? Or is it just kind of lingering of some of the tougher buying behavior?\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. I think it's mostly the buying behavior. You talked about markets. It's deal volume being up, but at smaller deal sizes, which causes NDR to go down. And that's what's impacting your RPO rate. So still strong from a growth perspective year-to-year, still long commitments from our customers. And we're feeling good about RPO, but it's mostly the smaller deal volume and combined with larger amounts of deals happening.\nMark Murphy: Understood. Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thanks, Mark. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to push a little bit more on this because it's hard to reconcile three numbers for us. On the one hand, we have the guide for next quarter at 10%. We have CRPO bookings at 3% this quarter, and we have a consensus estimate for growth for next year at 18%. I completely understand the commentary about smaller deal sizes and a larger volume of deals, but can you dimensionalize both of those attributes, like how much more volume are you seeing? How much smaller are the deal sizes, when does an NRR bottom because this would be a good time to maybe just help us understand, is that 10% the right jumping off point as we think about next year, is there an acceleration curve baked into next year based on your conviction level around upselling on some of these -- this larger volume of lands, give us a little bit of color so we can kind of model this out.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, thanks Alex. I think a lot of your questions came out around sort of our -- the view of '25. And I think the only thing I can say at this point is we're seeing good contract activity at the smaller sizes, which means that people still believe in our software and are designing us in, right? What we haven't seen, to Dave's point earlier, is buying behavior changes, and we're operating under that assumption until we see it, which means that we aren't forecasting anything beyond what we see. So we got to execute Q4 first, and we'll give you our '25 view in Q1 when we normally do.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. Understood. And I guess, maybe, Dave, how much of the -- how should we think about execution here and some of the new sales strategies, either making this -- pushing this faster or making it actually go slower? Like is that a tailwind or a headwind to realizing to getting back to some of those larger deal conversations or dynamics over the next few quarters?\nDave McJannet: Got it. Thanks. I think you're sort of asking just sort of what's the implication of some of the modification for go-to-market approach on that model. And I would just -- I'd come back to now the fact that we brought in a new President of field operations, as you know, as Susan St. Ledger has brought a bunch of simplification and rigor and efficiency to what we're doing. At the same time, these are infrastructure sales cycles. And so I would expect the impact of that to be felt in the coming quarters, not immediately. Super excited about the modifications there. She just brought on some strong folks and she's been a great partner. But I would really expect her impact to be felt over the future quarters as opposed to this quarter and the next.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks Alex.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks guys. Can you just give a little bit of an update on the revenue or the bookings mix between Terraform and Vault? And maybe just provide us some directional color around the growth rates there. through 2023. And then just maybe on the other side of that, can you just talk about how some of those mix shift dynamics between Terraform and Vault are sort of playing into the near-term go-to-market strategy, the product's road map, and how you guys are thinking about navigating 2024.\nDave McJannet: Maybe I'll start with that one. This is Dave. Thanks for that. So I think I would just decompose our portfolio into two basic lifecycle solutions. One is around infrastructure lifecycle and the other one is around the security lifecycle. And obviously, Terraform's aligned in the infrastructure cycle, Vault and boundary aligned with the security lifecycle. I would say there's equivalent interest really in both. And I'd say, over time, those business have been very, very consistently similar. When organizations get more mature in their operations, those two concerns get combined into a common platform engineering function, just to put the pieces together. But our fundamental consumers is [Indiscernible] and of person and a security person. So that dynamic is unchanged. And I think security lifecycle of is the way you think about it and maybe Navam comment is the financial aspect.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. I think from a net new ACV perspective, I think there are roughly equal give or take, a 200,000 one way or the other on the 2. The security lifecycle products are slightly larger so that the infrastructure products grow slightly faster at a smaller base, but they combine -- make up the majority of our revenue.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thanks, Nick. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Oliver Cokenden from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nPat Walravens: Actually, it's Pat Walravens. Thank you. Armon, this one, I think it's for you, which is -- I was just looking back in my old MongoDB model. And when they were at roughly $150 million in total revenue, the cloud was 47% of total revenue and growing 61%. You guys have $150 million in quarterly revenue, the cloud is $14 million. So just walk us through what are the sort of two or three key points we need to understand about the difference between a database that's moving to the cloud and Hashi's infrastructure solutions.\nArmon Dadgar: Pat, yes, thanks for the question. I think what I'd point to is the major difference is, if I think about something like a database like Mongo versus the solutions we have, it's where they sit in the stack and sort of their level of criticality. And what I mean by that is obviously, database is critical, but typically, it's bound to the scope of a single application, right? And building a that new app, that app needs to store some data, great [indiscernible] spend up a Mongo database for that. When you think about our solution by virtue of being infrastructure, they span horizontally across usually hundreds, thousands, if not the entire estate, right? And so if you think about something like Vault, you might have hundreds of applications connected into it. So the criticality is different. And then the -- as a result of that, the customer's willingness to have that outside of their control when something goes potentially wrong is very different. And I think that's the feedback we consistently get from our customers is, guys, this is Tier 0 software, if I lose Vault, if I lose Console, my data center goes down, right? And so I think that willingness to let a third-party run it where they don't necessarily have the direct operational control. It's just a much higher bar. And when you think about what are the vendors these folks really trust, it's effectively Amazon, Azure or Google right? And even that was a position of trust that took many years for the cloud to get to within these enterprise vendors. So I think that's the difference I would point to. The good news is we're seeing that shift, right? And so I think we're increasingly seeing our enterprise customers realize they don't have the operational expertise to operate this the way we do. And so we are starting to see even our largest enterprise customers go down the path of HCP. And so we're excited about that. Particularly, we see a difference in behavior between our sort of run time products and non-run time. So for non-runtime tools, like Terraform, for example, there's more willingness. And so I think that's why next year, we're looking at really defaulting a land motion to Terraform Cloud because we feel like we're at that point where customer willingness is their platform capability is there.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thanks, Pat. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Fatima Boolani from Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Armon, just on that line of discussion around landing more and leading more with cloud, especially in the enterprise I'm wondering as you put your heads together with Navam and Dave, what sort of inflation does that have for how you might have to re-architect your pricing strategy for the enterprise in the same breath driving adoption, but also managing the complexity that might come with partially self-managed and partially consumption-oriented offering. So I guess the question is, you kind of have to blow up your pricing model to drive that behavior in the enterprise? And how would that impact kind of your reported financial metrics? Thank you.\nArmon Dadgar: Fatima, yes, no, great question. Obviously, it's something we spent a lot about time thinking about for the reasons you outlined, we obviously don't want to be in a position of having to blow up a pricing model. And so the reality is what we looked at really doing for customers is there should effectively be no change to their licensing costs, plus or minus as they're going from self-managed to cloud. What we don't want to do is create a tax on them for doing the things we want them to do. We want customers to adopt cloud. We want them to be on the HCP platform because it gives us a bunch more visibility into their usage, we don't have as much support issues we have to navigate for customers who don't have the operational skills so we want them fundamentally to be in the cloud. So we don't want to tax them for doing that. So as a result, we spent a lot of time making sure the pricing and packaging is consistent to help them navigate through that. So it's more about making sure that customers have a willingness to adopt cloud and the capabilities are there to meet their enterprise requirements. And we feel good that we're at that point where customers are certainly signaling that willingness now for Terraform.\nDave McJannet: Fatima, the only point I think I'm just trying to eat your question, to be clear, our cloud pricing is an entitlement-based model, just like our self-management model it. So for us, it's really not a huge transition contractually, if that makes sense?\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Fatima. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. This is for Navam, and I wanted to ask about the net revenue retention number. Curious if that's been all pressure on just the expansion side? Or if you've seen any churn. And what I'm wondering is if you're seeing any customers move from paid to three open source at all. And then what is your average contract like? Because I presume that once you get through the cycle of renewals, the pressure on that expansion cadence would probably get lifted.\nDave McJannet: Derrick, it's Dave. I'll answer the first one. As a general rule, people don't move from our commercial offerings to the open source. There are certainly instances where if someone is under extreme budget pressure, they might do that temporarily, but that is sort of a bit of an anti-pattern you certainly hear about it anecdotally. But given the scale of number of customers we have and the scale of users, it's not the most common one. But let Navam mention the financial side.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, on the net retention side, Derek, most of the net retention impact quarter-over-quarter comes from the expansion and extension side meaning smaller expansions and extensions. Now there's some gross retention impact. For example, this quarter, there was an acquisition which caused the churn. But for the most part, the net retention is impacted by the smaller deal sizes on expand extended.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thanks, Derek. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is come from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on -- I think it was Alex's earlier question. So if I look at the guidance, the high end of the Q4 guide implies that you exit the year with revenue growth of 11%, and I'm not asking for fiscal '25 guidance, but maybe could you just talk directionally about like the top factors, whether it be product initiatives, go-to-market, things that could drive improved growth.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, this is Navam. So in '25, like I said, we really want to go execute Q4 and then get into the new year to see what the demand environment looks like. We're holding a very measured view into the forecast and the view is that we're going to grow revenue faster than we are going to go cost and maintain our profitability -- our free cash flow profitability and move towards upping profitability on the -- by the end of next year or by the back half of next year. So the upping trends and the trends are going to be good, while we wait for or see for signs of macro improvement, which will drive productivity up.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay, thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Maybe going back to Pat's question a little bit on the cloud. It's been three quarters in a row that the absolute dollar adds. I understand they're small have come down sequentially. What needs to happen to get that absolute spend accelerating? Thanks.\nArmon Dadgar: Brad, Yes. I think ultimately, it's really about flipping the behavior of the enterprise sales team, right? I think we've talked about this before. We sort of think about a commercial sales motion versus an enterprise sales motion. Historically, we've mostly sold the cloud product into commercial. And I think that's where you see more macro pressure with the smaller customers, which impacts on the sequential cloud growth. I think for us to really see a dramatic shift in the sort of the dynamics. It's really about changing the behavior of the core sales team that's looking at the enterprise. I think that's where we're signaling that we feel that demand signals we're now seeing from the enterprise customers tell us that the appetite is there. And certainly, we feel like the product capabilities are there, that we feel that at least we're going to flip Terraform Cloud where the customer appetite is there to a default cloud motion, and we expect that, that would have a significant impact on that quarter-over-quarter behavior.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay, thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from line of Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, thanks for taking the question. Nice to meet everybody on the call. wanted to double quick on how you're thinking about the role of the partner ecosystem as you change and reevaluate the go-to-market, specifically CSPs, AWS and the marketplace as well as the global system integrator partner community. Thank you.\nDave McJannet: Yes, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. So our partner focuses are really around the cloud providers, Amazon, Azure, GCP, et cetera. And then secondarily, it's the system-integrated community. And I think we actually had a huge presence at reInvent last week, which I think is indicative our very tight go-to-market relationship with all three of the big clouds. Now, we certainly, won a collaboration partner of the year from Amazon this past year, which is probably the best indicator of how our teams are working together. So it's very much a co-sell behavior with them. And certainly, we work closely with the material percentage of our opportunities go through their cloud marketplaces, and that's good for them and good for us. So very, very close with the CSPs, and that's been a very strong relationship for us for a very long time. On the system integrator side, our focus is around the skills gap that exists for the deployment and adoption of cloud technologies. And I'd say, like many vendors are scale, the majority of our efforts have been to date with the smaller SIs around the world of which we have hundreds that we work with. But we certainly are working ever closer with the global system integrators. But those are the primary partners we're working with and we have a large investment in it and we feel really, really good about how they're both going to be candid.\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Carlie on for Brad. I guess first question I want to ask on the enterprise customers A I guess the customer net add is kind of healthy compared to last quarter, but then just on per customer spend basis. The number -- the quarter-over-quarter growth, 0.2% is kind of flattish. You guys definitely mentioned smaller contract size, but just any additional like nuances that you can share on those like bigger like larger customer spending.\nNavam Welihinda: Carlie, it's Navam. No, I think it boils down to the deal volume being higher and the contract sizes being smaller. You're still consuming our software and still designing us in, but doing that in smaller quantities. This year as they go through that digestion period that Dave talked about following the aggressive investment cycle.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay. Let's go to the next question, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: Hi, guys. Thanks. So on the expansion, where they've been expansion from a DR perspective, as the challenge has been more on the expand side or on the expense side? So in other words, just number of seats and units in the entitlement, or is it adding new products and people buying more into the platform?\nDave McJannet: It's David. I don't think there's a real difference to be totally honest. I think every company we engage with has both product side of the problem, the infrastructure road the security problem. And I think it's pretty consistent. It goes back more towards the digestion process of entitlements that they've consumed. And so no real difference between the two is the short answer. They're very connected to that the meta position of our customer base as they're just getting through what they got.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thanks, Mike, and good luck in your next endeavor. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Miller Jump from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMiller Jump: Great, thank you for taking the question. Maybe on the packaging side, you all introduced your first bundle approach this year. Can you just talk about maybe what you've learned there and how that could impact the upsell opportunity heading into the renewal heavy Q4? Like is this something that could potentially drive increased deal sizes in your mind?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes, thanks for the question. I think the bundle has been relatively successful for us. I think the way we think about it is, ultimately, it's an opportunity to help accelerate that extension motion, right? So customers who typically we don't position the bundle as a land. It's usually something we leverage as a renewal time to the point you made as a way of introducing the additional products into the account, helping seed them and then ultimately growing those within the estate as well. So I think the lesson learned is that it has been successful. We introduced it on the security lifecycle today with the Zero Trust bundle. I think we're going to look at continuing to probably leverage that as we think about simplifying go-to-market next year and having a similar type approach across our security and infrastructure lifecycle.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks Miller.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave McJannet, CEO, for closing remarks.\nDave McJannet: Yes, I'd just like to express my thanks for the participation from everyone here, and we certainly appreciate you dialing in and for all the questions. We look forward to speaking to everybody soon. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker today to Alex Kurtz, VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kurtz: Good afternoon, and welcome to HashiCorp's fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. This afternoon, we will be discussing our second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results announced in our press release issued after the market closed today.

Finally, we will be holding an investor event during our annual HashiCorp User Conference in San Francisco on October 11th. We look forward to seeing many of you there, and we will also live stream the event from our IR site. With that, let me turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\nDave McJannet: Thank you, Alex, and welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call for fiscal 2024. We reported solid second quarter results that exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with revenue of $143 million, representing year-over-year growth of 26%. Current non-GAAP remaining performance obligations reached $420 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth and we added 21 customers with greater than or equal to $100,000 in annual recurring revenue to reach a total of 851. Our HashiCorp Cloud Platform offerings reached $18.4 million in revenue, representing 13% of subscription revenue in the quarter. We're excited for the new capabilities we announced during HashiDays in Europe around HCP and Terraform, Vault, Boundary and across our whole product portfolio, and we have more to announce at our Global User Conference this October. Our team executed well and delivered solid results against an ongoing challenging backdrop. Although we continue to see elongated deal cycles, our performance shows that we remain a critical part of the Global 2000's cloud plans and our strategic partner for their long-term transitions to the cloud. To put it simply, though the purchasing environment is difficult, we continue to win the market. As an example of this, in June, we hosted our European User Conference taking place in the three sold out locations simultaneously, in Paris, Munich and in London. During the keynote, I was joined by a large multinational financial services company, who is a long-time HashiCorp customer and an excellent example of how over time we’ve become a strategic partner to the Global 2000. This customer shared how they approach their move to the cloud and how they adopted a platform engineering team to scale their consumption of cloud resources using automated provisioning from Terraform Enterprise. As their platform team expanded their use of Terraform, they enabled more than 3,000 developers to consume cloud resources autonomously and powered over 200 internal applications, which ultimately accelerated delivery of new capabilities for their banking customers. This customer use case is a great example of the long-term journey their organizations make with us. At HashiDays, we also made several product announcements that highlighted continued investment in innovation across our portfolio, and I want to briefly share a few of those. First, we announced the highly anticipated general availability of HashiCorp Boundary Enterprise. The early response to Boundary Enterprise has been exciting, with a healthy initial pipeline and interest growing by the day. As organizations transition to cloud, they are finding they require a modern cloud-friendly privileged access management solution, which until Boundary was not available in the market. We also announced several product enhancements across our portfolio, including Terraform, Vault and Consul. This quarter, as I traveled and met with customers in Europe and other parts of the world, I heard a consistent message from them. The transition to the cloud is still in full swing and requires new approaches to managing infrastructure, which our products provide. And once these new approaches and technologies are adopted, teams are enabled to build faster, more efficiently and more securely. Despite macroeconomic conditions, customer planning for cloud hasn't changed. Finally, I want to reiterate that we remain focused on achieving our profitability targets while at the same time positioning ourselves for a future of continued cloud adoption. I remain very optimistic about our long-term opportunity, and we continue to build HashiCorp to meet it. Thank you. I look forward to seeing you at our investor event during HashiConf in San Francisco in October. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Navam and I look forward to answering any questions.\nNavam Welihinda: Thank you, Dave, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. As Dave mentioned, we are pleased with our team's performance for the second quarter and delivered solid top line results. Compared to our seasonally low first quarter, we saw better contract activity both in total and also within the Global Enterprise segment during the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, sales cycles remain elongated, and procurement scrutiny was ongoing. We expect this cautious spending environment to persist through the rest of 2024. However, we also expect the bigger trend of enterprise cloud transformation efforts to continue despite the current economic uncertainty. On the expense side, we continue to operate the business with a heavy focus on ROI, resulting in better than forecasted non-GAAP EPS for the quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter for HashiCorp is a seasonally low free cash flow and cash flow from operations quarter, mainly due to the seasonal first quarter contract volume where collections occur in the second quarter. Free cash flow reverts back to normal trends in Q3 and Q4, and we always view free cash flow and cash flow from operations on a trailing four-quarter basis. Our full guidance numbers can be found in our earnings presentation available on our ir.hashicorp.com website under Financials, Quarterly Results. I encourage you to read through the doc for full metric disclosures, share count disclosures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. To summarize our guidance, for the third quarter of fiscal '24, we expect total revenue in the range of $142 million to $144 million. and a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $26 million to $23 million. For the full fiscal year '24 we expect total revenue in the range of $571 million and $575 million and expect FY24 non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $108 million and $105 million. A couple of final notes before Q&A. First, the severance costs from the reduction in force from last quarter was included in our non-GAAP expenses. These costs amounted to $7 million or an additional $0.04 in non-GAAP EPS. And second, as a reminder, our third quarter has typical seasonality due to the summer months, and we have factored the seasonality into our guidance. In closing, we are excited to see many of you at our investor event on October 11th that will also be live streamed on our IR site. Thanks for your attention. Dave, Armon and I are available to take any of your questions. Alex?\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you. Operator, can we go to our first question?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks guys. Shortened to the point I like it. Maybe you can talk about productivity and this quarter on the sales force side, how do you feel about progression there? And maybe, I know it's early, but anything you can share about Susan's first days in the field, any noticeable thoughts perhaps on how she's doing and what she's planning?\nDave McJannet: Hey Ittai. Thanks for the question. It's Dave. On to the Susan question, just to remind folks that Susan understands the Company well through her time on the Board and is certainly already adding value. She's been spending her time with the field teams, understands the lay of the land. And I would say that there's a lot of excitement for her leadership. It's super, super early for her involvement with us. The question around sort of progression and productivity, I think perhaps it's more of a broader question around sort of the demand environment and how we're seeing it. And I would say that -- I would say, I did like 20 meetings this week with companies who were in town for the Google Next event. And I'm reminded of the critical role that we play in the infrastructure life cycle is pretty profound for the largest companies in the world. And that being said, we're in the midst of an optimization cycle, I think in the software market in general, and there's a lot of conservatism on spend, and we certainly have reflected that in our approach. But that being said, we don't see any material change in people's cloud plans or the competitive dynamics of the market. And we're just focused on winning the trust of the largest organizations in the world.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: I guess maybe just first one for you, Dave, like you mentioned the environment is kind of unchanged. I guess, did it change between kind of the beginning and the end of the quarter and here into the following quarter, has it gotten any better or worse? And then, bigger picture, do you see changing spend priorities, meaning generative coming in and almost crowding out some other projects, pushing out some other initiatives on a longer time scale? And then just one for Navam, if the recent BSL change, how should we be thinking about any numerical or model impacts from that over the course of the next few quarters?\nDave McJannet: I'll try to tackle those in order and I’ll let maybe Armon to answer a couple of them. On the question on the demand environment, no, since in the last couple of months, honestly, it feels pretty consistent. As we've always been clear to communicate, our products are deeply considered because they're very, very seriously parts of the infrastructure stack. And so, the front-end demand signals remain super consistent that -- how that flows through procurement is we find out later. So I would say net not a huge change. On the spend priorities, I would actually just point back to people need to keep in mind that this AI push implies cloud. New applications that are AI in their orientation are built on cloud infrastructure. And in as much as that is the truth, our products play a role. So, I would say, actually, our products underpin much of what's happening under the covers in the cloud estates. And so, we are part of that strategic initiative generally speaking. So, that's probably the best way to describe it. Any other comment you’d make Armon about it?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes, sure. I think I'd add two things, which is one is, I think to Dave's point, it implies cloud, but I think more than that, it actually implies multi-cloud. Because what we've seen from a lot of enterprise customers that maybe are predominantly on one CSP or had a hybrid strategy. Now people are looking at how do they leverage best-of-breed technology across a multi-cloud estate. And I think that raises the salience of our portfolio in terms of enabling multi-cloud access control with things like Vault, enabling user access across these different services with Boundary and obviously provisioning across it with Terraform. So, I do think that priority shift has been interesting and helpful for us. And then to the folks that are heavily invested in private data center, we're also seeing interest there in tools like Nomad. And I think that was a major customer that we discussed this quarter that there was an on-premise expansion around Nomad to drive GPU workloads. So, we are continuing to see sort of AI driving a bunch of interesting workload shifts, both in cloud and on-premise for us. I think to your last question, which was on the BSL change and should we expect any impact from that. No, I think the key motivation for us is really understanding how do we get to the right long-term model that allows us to continue and invest in open innovation in the product. And that's really what it's about, and that's what the license change enables us to do. And so, no expectation in terms of revenue.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys. I just had a quick question on the acquisition of BluBracket. I guess maybe a two-part question here. The first one just being is, is there any revenue contribution that we should be aware of on a go-forward basis from BluBracket? And then, secondly, can you guys just maybe unpack your strategy around M&A and whether or not we should expect more of these types of acquisitions, or is there any appetite to maybe do larger acquisitions?\nArmon Dadgar: Sure. Yes, let me take the first one, we can talk about kind of the philosophy of how we're thinking about M&A. So, on BluBracket, the company came with a small amount of incremental revenue. We're in the process of integrating the teams, integrating the products, and that's going well and is sort of ahead of where we thought schedule-wise from both team integration and product integration. So, our hope is to have that on market in relatively short order. So, small impact to revenue today, and we expect more of a contribution next year as it's fully integrated. As we think about kind of the philosophy of M&A for us, we're very much focused on where there are products that are adjacent to our core offerings, where there's sort of a natural synergy. So with BluBracket, I think the obvious synergy for us was for customers that are starting with Vault, their first and obvious question is how do I help onboard secrets that I have in my estate interval? And BluBracket helps solve that gap. So, it's an obvious adjacency, has clear synergy to same buyer and really helps accelerate Vault adoption. I think that's really where our interest lies. As we look across core products, where are there opportunities to accelerate our road map. And obviously, we look for alignment to our core products and core buyers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on a good set of numbers here. So, I just wanted to maybe drill into current RPO and just how we should translate that to the guidance. If I look at Q2, current RPO had a good sequential improvement just on an absolute dollar basis versus Q1. And then, the year-over-year growth actually ticked slightly higher in the quarter. So, I'm just curious, is there anything just other than conservatism that would explain why revenue was roughly flat in Q3 from Q2. Just any moving parts there to think about?\nNavam Welihinda: Hey Gary, it's Navam here. Thanks for the question. So yes, we're very happy with the solid CRPO and bookings performance this quarter. So that was a solid quarter of performance. The thing you've got to remember is as an enterprise software company, you have seasonality in the back half compared to the first half, right? So, you have a seasonally larger second quarter, which has a different compared to last year's second half. And what we're factoring into Q3 and Q4 is basically the demand environment that Dave talked about, which is a challenging purchasing environment, but at the same time, digital transformation and cloud efforts continuing. So, that's factored into our Q3 and Q4 forecast guidance. So, that's the impact you're seeing on revenue versus the cRPO growth line. So overall, I think we're very pleased with the cRPO results forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Navam, similar question to Gray’s. I noticed that nice sequential growth in the cRPO, that's great to see. That occurred with a low volume of customer adds. And so, I'm wondering if you could just explain the mechanics. For instance, did you have a few pretty chunky deals in the mix, anything different in terms of composition? And then for Armon, I wanted to ask you, we noticed at Google Next that your announcement that the Google provider for Terraform had been downloaded 350 million times. And I just looked at, it's climbed to 370 million. So it looks like it's kind of shockingly active. And I'm wondering if -- should we look at that as confirming what you're mentioning there just in terms of multi-cloud movement? Is it -- is that somehow moving faster while the -- amidst this kind of slowdown where more companies are optimizing? Do you actually see them kind of spreading their footprints over into Azure and Google a little more actively?\nArmon Dadgar: Sure. Thanks, Mark. Let me take the second question, and then I can hand it back over to Navam. Yes. No, I think -- certainly, I think we continue to be impressed as those download counts cross new thresholds, to your point, I think Google had an impressive milestone. I think AWS recently crossed the 2 billion download mark as well. So, we're continuing to see a lot of download activity. I think going back to my comment earlier, I do think we're seeing the investments in generative AI driving more multi-cloud interest. And I think certainly, customers that were maybe focused on one primary CSP are now looking at, hey, how do I access some of these best-of-breed capabilities that Google is announcing, Azure is announcing, AWS certainly has quite a bit of offering. So, I think all the clouds are investing in focused offerings, and I think that is driving sort of a look to how do you get access to best of breed. So I think that's certainly fair.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, Mark. And hey, it's Navam. On the customer mix question, just a note on the customers, there are a wide range of customers in our total customer group, right? There's the G2K on the high end; and then there's the smaller self-serve customers on the low end, and these are customers generally spending somewhere around $2,500 a year. So what you're seeing on sort of the total customer count perspective is the movement of that self-serve small customer count, we saw some impact this quarter. But in terms of revenue impact, there's almost an immaterial impact of that customer group since they're so small. So in terms of sort of the gross customer additions from our sales team and the 100,000 customer additions, they're remaining consistent. We're still taking ground there, and there wasn't any outsized impact on any single deal that we saw in the second quarter for our revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nBrad Sills: I wanted to ask if you could provide some more color, please, on the updates you mentioned to the cloud offering. What are those? And might that be a catalyst for that business? And then, also any observations on the macro impact on Terraform versus Vault and the core offerings, is Vault seeing more resilient results here given that it's going after security perhaps more of an outsized impact that you saw last quarter to Terraform? Just any observation on that interplay? Thank you so much.\nArmon Dadgar: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Brad. Yes. So some of the key cloud updates, and this is from our June HashiDays event in Europe was really a security focus set of thematics that we shared among a bunch of other updates. So across the board, Dave mentioned the Boundary one certainly was a big launch for us was the introduction of Boundary Enterprise, which was our self-managed product as well as a set of advanced privileged access management features like session recording and that's what driving a lot of customer conversation around what is a modern PAM tool and cloud solve for. And those updates span both our self-managed Boundary Enterprise as well as our cloud-delivered HCP Boundary. On the -- with the other security tools, we introduced a net new cloud service around Vault. So this is called Vault Cloud Secret. So we introduced that in a public data and made that available for the first time, really multi-tenant, much easier to use, quicker to onboard. And I think we've seen great adoption and interest in that, really looking at how do we make it push button and very easy to onboard into Vault and continuing to see strong demand from customers looking for simpler solutions to get started quickly. Around Terraform Cloud, there was a whole bunch of different updates around different capabilities, really focused on different areas around policy, cost management and ease of use and onboarding. So, Terraform import was a key thing to bring unmanaged resources into Terraform, a femoral workspaces to allow better cost management, so users can basically deprovision dev test environments when they're not using them to reduce their cloud cost. And then with Consul, we introduced a few different cloud capabilities around observability and workflow management. So really for our at-scale customers looking for how do I do global management of multiple Consul clusters, how do I do observability to understand to save these clusters. And so there was -- I think what we're seeing is the net new state of capabilities that are coming to cloud are differentiating the cloud offering from the self-management and continue to drive a healthy rate of adoption and inbound interest to the cloud. In terms of the -- how are we seeing the macro impact? And is there any sort of delta between the various core products. I think by and large, we're not really seeing any difference. I think Terraform continuing to benefit as customers want to go multi-cloud, Gen AI certainly helpful there. I think cyber remains very robust. So lots of interest in our security portfolio and the Zero Trust tools around boundary Vault, Consul. So I think we're not seeing a whole lot of differential demand.\nDave McJannet: I’d just maybe add one comment, I think, I understand the essence of your question about cloud. I just -- I'm going to pull it back and say, historically, the cloud consumption has come from our corporate segment, the SMB segment. I think as we continue to invest a steady cadence like the ones that Armon announced, we are seeing increasing interest from the enterprise customers. Certainly, lots of green shoots from some of the very, very largest companies that are inclined to consume those as managed services. But as we've always said, infrastructure is a lot more deeply considered than, say, a database. And so, it is happening on a measured pace, but we're super optimistic given the green shoots that we do see and the continued investment we're putting into our cloud offering that we'll continue to see steady growth there. But for now, it is largely the smaller cohort of customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Sherman: It's Andrew on for Derrick. Dave, wanted to ask about Boundary, how traction is so far there. I know it's early with the self-managed version that just went GA. But, maybe just talk about what you're seeing in that market? What are your reps saying about it as they go to market with this? And could we start to see that contribute to revenue maybe early next year? Thanks.\nDave McJannet: Sure. I'll let Armon answer that one.\nArmon Dadgar: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, in general, I'd say we're very excited about it. I think the general feedback we've gotten from customers is as they go to cloud, they have a much more dynamic infrastructure. It's much more a femoral and they're looking to adopt Zero Trust practices. And so I think Boundary fits right in that cross here. And as a consequence of that, we're seeing a lot of inbound interest, from existing customers and in fact new prospects as well. So this quarter, we landed a few pretty significant boundary deals. Some of these were expansion opportunities from existing customers and some were land customers as well. So, I think from that perspective, we're excited in terms of the demand signals that we're seeing from customers. And certainly, the field feedback has been very positive, and we're continuing to build momentum with new enterprise capabilities that we announced at our conference.\nDave McJannet: I think what's very clear to me is that the cloud paradigm does introduce new requirement for this particular market. And I think that was our theory early on and continues to be borne out in the customer demand. I'd say, 9 out of 10 conversations I have with customers today, this is the topic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. Thanks for taking our question. In the press release, you guys highlighted a really good win in the APJ government agency. Can you talk about any process or time line you haven't faced for FedRAMP across actually really Vault or Boundary or Terraform? And then how you're thinking about kind of the opportunity and when that opens up in the U.S. federal business for you guys? Thank you.\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. Thanks, Quinton. In general, as we're thinking about cloud, it's a progression for us in terms of how do we move from -- today, as Dave mentioned, predominantly tends to be our SMB corporate customers that are consuming cloud. As we're looking at the next set of commercial opportunity, for us, it's a big focus on unlocking the commercial market. So, a top priority for us is really PCI as we're going into next year, and we think that's the largest opportunity ahead is bringing the commercial customers that today are predominantly self-managed within our enterprise segment. Of course, as I think longer term, FedRAMP, I think, is going to play an important role, particularly for SLED and civilian agencies. And so it's certainly on our road map as well.\nDave McJannet: I could perhaps just clarify to you because there's sometimes confusion around FedRAMP. FedRAMP really just applies to SaaS offerings, to underscore the point that our products in self-managed form are broadly used in that environment already. And we call that Fed Ready, just to delineate.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. You’ve got Theo on for Sanjit. It looks like pretty steady quarter overall. And I wanted to ask one question on kind of the pricing changes that were announced and that are upcoming around like Terraform Cloud. And my question is really like how should we think about pricing changes, both for Terraform Cloud, but also maybe for the broader portfolio kind of on a go-forward basis, like what's the ability to make further changes? And then, have you adopted any early indications in terms of how customers are receiving that? Any color on that will be super helpful.\nDave McJannet: Yes. I’ll let Armon answer that.\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. Thanks Theo. So yes, I think on the Terraform PMP, our goal is really a few things, right? And so this is particularly the Terraform Cloud pricing and packaging changes. The goal was to simplify effectively before we had a few different tiers and particularly, there was a free tier that had sort of a very limited subset of capability that was distinct from sort of our standard and more premium tiers. So, what we've done was -- and the design goal here was to really bring that into one framework where there's a standard on a premium tier and the free tier is just a usage capped version of the standard tier. So what the value of that is, as our new customers and users on board, they get access to the full suite of Terraform Cloud capability. They get a sense for the value it adds. And as they continue to scale up with the product, they cross in from the free tier into our paying tier, but on the same SKU. So, it really simplifies in some sense that motion of users signing up organically using the platform and then growing into being a paid customer. The near-term impact of that PMP shift is you had some customers at the very low end of our paid tier that move into the free tier just given the new structure of it. But the flip side of it, I think where we've been excited to see is that it's driven a substantial uptake in the sign-up rate of Terraform Cloud. So I think that's kind of the near-term impact of it. And I think an expectation it's going to make it easier for us to onboard users and then graduate them from our free tier into our paid offering as they continue to scale. In terms of, I think, the broader question, I think, obviously, we're constantly fine-tuning and looking at pricing and packaging across. I think our goal philosophically is we want to enable our customers to sort of land small and align a unit of value to ultimately their consumption and their usage, so that as they grow their cloud programs and as they're getting more value out of the tooling that we grow with them. And so, we're always looking at how do we simplify that, but that's sort of the core philosophy.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Miller Jump from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nMiller Jump: So maybe thinking about the existing customer base. Last quarter, you all called out the large customer that kind of rightsized to a smaller contract. I'm curious, did you have any more of this activity with large customers in the quarter, or is there kind of incremental confidence now that this is more of a one-off? And I guess, maybe just an add-on to that about Q3, you're comping against a really strong Q3 from last year. So, just curious for any color on the renewal opportunity that you all have there and -- or any headwinds to call out on the flip side? Thanks.\nDave McJannet: Sure. Thanks. Yes. No, I just underscore that customer that we called out last quarter remains one of our very largest customers. And I think more generally, as I pointed out, I think there's this optimization cycle going on across all the software, and we're doing the same with our vendors. And I think that is likely to continue for some period of time, but that -- what we called out in the last quarter was a very unusual scenario, and I wouldn't expect that to be representative to go forward.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. Specifically, the second quarter gross retention was a better quarter than Q1. So we were very pleased with that result.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Billy on for Michael. I think some of us have been keyed in on the opportunities and risks associated with monetizing open source users. Does your switching of the source code license benefit that monetization in some way, or is this change kind of more geared towards addressing competitive pressures or something else?\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. Thanks, Billy. I think right now there's a whole lot of misinformation in the market associated with our license change to the business source license. In practice, there is really no impact to our customers, our partners and 99-plus percent of the user community around the tools. So, what it's really about was really addressing the sense that there's a handful of effectively product clones that are cloning our product, and that's been enabled by our traditional NPL license. And so what this changes about is, what's the right long-term model for us to continue to innovate openly within the community. And so, that's really what was motivating it.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Maybe for you, Dave. I mean, just if you look at this business from a high level, in Q3 of last year, you were growing 52% and your guidance for this Q3 is 14%. I just never would have expected such a big slowdown. So, maybe rank the factors that have driven that slowdown? And when could it reaccelerate?\nDave McJannet: I'm not sure I have a simple answer to the elements. Certainly, I think the optimization cycle for infrastructure is all in the same path as everybody else. I think the reality is if you look at our Global 2000 customer adds and the customer wins that we're at and they're very, very consistent. What we're just seeing is a slightly lower ASP starting price as those companies are applying more caution to the buying cycles. So, if I were to point something out, it would really be the starting point for some of these larger customers that are taking the propensity to start smaller rather than what was happening a couple of years ago. That being said, they're not changing their plans, their cloud plans remain intact, and we're still winning the market. It's just a function of the scale at which people are beginning. Point number two, I think we've seen an elongation of sort of the expansion and extension cycles, not surprisingly as a lot more scrutiny has been applied to the budgets that are out there. And I've always been of the view these sort of cyclical changes in fact, different companies at different -- who are at different stages of their overall life cycle. We are sort of in early stages of our growth arc, and so have 4,000 customers, not 40,000 customers to work with. And I think that's indicative of what you're seeing in the impact of that on us. That being said, like I said, these trends are next moving forward, once we get to the digestion cycle that is in every Global 2000 account for every software vendor, we're super optimistic that we can get the growth rates to continue to be super aggressive. And we'll keep executing towards that vision.\nPatrick Walravens: I just want to take a shot at when we might see it?\nDave McJannet: I would refer to the guidance that you'll see from us at the end of this year, which reflects our best view of how that continues to progress. I think anything else will be speculation.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dave McJannet for closing remarks.\nDave McJannet: Just like to express my thanks for the participation from everyone here, and we certainly appreciate you dialing in and for all the questions. So we look forward to speaking with many of you at our event in October. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may all disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker today, Alex Kurtz, VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kurtz: Good afternoon, and welcome to HashiCorp's fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. This afternoon, we will be discussing our first quarter fiscal 2024 financial results announced in our press release issued after the market close today. With me are HashiCorp's CEO, Dave McJannet; CFO, Navam Welihinda; and CTO and Co-Founder, Armon Dadgar.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as how we define these and other metrics is included in our earnings press release, which has been furnished to the SEC and is also available on our website at ir.hashicorp.com. With that, let me turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\nDave McJannet: Thank you, Alex, and welcome, everyone to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal 2024. We're pleased to report first quarter results that exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with revenue of $138 million representing year-over-year growth of 37% and solid improvements in our profitability with our first quarter of positive free cash flow as a public company. Current non-GAAP remaining performance obligations reached $394.6 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. And compared to last quarter, we added 32 customers with greater than or equal to $100,000 in annual recurring revenue to reach a total of 830. Our HashiCorp Cloud Platform offerings reached $16.5 million in revenue, representing 12% of subscription revenue in the quarter. We remain excited about adoption trends as we continue to roll out new features and new capabilities during FY'24. Against a challenging environment, I'm pleased with the solid Q1 results that the team delivered. However, macro challenges continue to impact our business and I'd like to provide more color on what we're seeing in the market. During Q1, Armon and I spent much of our time speaking with customers. A key theme from these discussions, regardless of customer size, is the uncertainty that they are feeling about the economy and what it means for their own businesses. As we have mentioned in the last few earnings calls, we saw this budget uncertainty start in October of last year as higher interest rates began to impact our customers thinking about their FY'23 budget cycles. This economic uncertainty is driving organizations to optimize their software spend. Procurement teams are scrutinizing many larger software purchases and stretching deal cycles. As deepening inspection of budgets is happening across all of our customer segments, but most notably in our largest customer deals. Despite these near-term challenges, we believe the long-term trend to cloud computing remains unabated. We continue to see demand for our products as customers continue to plan their cloud initiatives for the next several years. I would highlight the customer stories we have outlined in our earnings presentation on the IR site to give us confidence in our market opportunity and product fit. These customers include a large US based financial services company, a backup office software platform, and a European stock exchange of very diverse verticals and all very early in their cloud adoption journey. We are laser focused on building trust with these customers so that we can be a central partner as they continue to invest in their cloud initiatives. In addition, our focus on adding larger new customers produce solid traction during Q1 as we added 26 net new global 2000 logos, the largest number we've added in five quarters, and we continue to add an healthy number of greater than $100,000 ARR customers as well. These large customers are an important part of our future and our model is built to grow our footprint with them as we become an increasingly critical piece of their infrastructure over time. So while we're seeing heavy budget scrutiny on our large expansion deals, these entry level deals with large companies give us confidence about the long-term shift to cloud and our role as the enabler of that transition. We also continue to see strong and growing interest in boundary, which we introduced late last year. As a reminder, boundary solves a key security challenge for organizations by using identity secure remote user access. As I noted earlier, Armon and I spent much of Q1 on the road with customers. In nearly every meeting, customers proactively inquire about Boundary, which is a great signal as to the longer term opportunity we see for the product. Next week we will host HashiDays, our European user conferences where we will make a series of announcements that highlight ongoing product innovation, particularly around cloud security automation. I look forward to sharing more details during next quarter's call. Before handing it over to Navam, I want to provide more detail on the announcements we made after the market closed today. First, we announced a reduction of our workforce by approximately 8%. I want to acknowledge that a lot of talented people who made meaningful contributions to HashiCorp are leaving the company. This is not a decision we made lightly and is part of a necessary effort that Navam will describe to reduce our operating costs to reflect the current customer spending environment. Second, we are excited that Susan St. Ledger will be joining the company in July as President of our worldwide field organization. Susan is a master of scale and a deeply technical sales leader who understands how to make the most of complex product portfolios. Susan has been on our board since 2019, so she's already well acquainted with HashiCorp, our products and our team. With Susan, we got the rare opportunity to work with an experienced leader who has done this multiple times, having most recently led the field organizations for Okta and Splunk, where she helped them each surpass $1 billion in revenue. We have trust and confidence that her experience and leadership will serve our field and overall organization well through the current economic conditions as well as through our next phase of growth. I believe strongly in our opportunity given the long-term trend of cloud adoption and believe we are now better positioned to take advantage of that opportunity. And in line with the guidance we provided last quarter, we continue to operate against an aggressive goal to achieve profitability next fiscal year and remain on track to meet this goal. Now I'd like to turn it over to Navam and I look forward to answering any questions.\nNavam Welihinda: Thank you, Dave, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results showed solid progress in our fundamental customer adoption engine. Our process remains very consistent. Customers adopt our open source products throughout the organization. We land the organization as a commercial customer with a particular product. The customer expands its product usage and then extends into adjacent products. The success of this adoption engine drove our customer account to increase by 261 in Q1 and our 100K plus ARR customer account to increase by 32. Our total customer count and 100K plus ARR customer count is currently 4,392 and 830 respectively. While the pattern of customer adoption remains consistent, as Dave mentioned, the economic headwinds we've noted in the past few quarters also continued into Q1. Combined with our typical first quarter seasonality, we saw ongoing pressure on customer budgets, which caused slowdowns in customer behavior and elongation of sales cycles. The impacts were most acute among our larger contracts within our global customer segment, along with the large enterprise customer segment. In addition, one of our largest customers in the retail sector, adjusted for some excess capacity and reduced a portion of their spend with us. The impact to our quarterly gross and net retention rates due to this customer spending adjustment was roughly two percentage points. Despite the adjustment, the customer continues to be very engaged with our team and remains one of our largest customers. We expect the current buying environment will create ongoing uncertainty in the pace of large customer expansions and extensions for the rest of the fiscal year. Accordingly, we have reflected these expectations in our full year guidance. We have also widened the range of our potential revenue outcomes given the overall purchasing environment. While we have shown ongoing diligence in managing our expenses, we are operating in a very cautious customer spending environment. As a result, we took additional steps today to reduce our cost structure through a reduction in force of approximately 8% of our workforce. Before making any employee reductions, we took a number of other carefully considered actions, including reducing our program spend and eliminating open, but unfilled jobs. It is difficult to transition out valued employees who have helped build HashiCorp and this was a very hard decision for the company. However, we also believe it is necessary to have the right spending and investment profile to navigate the current economic environment, while also maintaining enough resources to deliver on our long-term plan. Following the reduction in force which we expect to be materially complete by the end of Q2, we will begin to see the impact of these reductions in our free cash flow in Q3 of this year and beyond. We expect free cash flow margins of approximately negative 5% in FY'24, followed by sustainably positive free cash flows on an annual basis the following year and beyond. Other than seasonally low second quarter cash flows, we're expecting all other quarters to have positive free cash flows. We are maintaining our target to reach non-GAAP EBIT profitability in the second half of FY 2025. With that, let's move on to our guidance. Our full guidance numbers can be found in our earnings presentations available in our ir.hashicorp.com website under financials quarterly results. I encourage you to read through the doc for full metric disclosures, share count disclosures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. To summarize our guidance, for the second quarter of FY'24, we expect total revenue in the range of $137 million to $139 million and a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $46 million to $43 million. For the full year '24, we expect total revenue in the range of $564 million and $570 million and expect FY'24 non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $113 million and $108 million. Thanks for your attention. Dave, Armon and I are available to take any of your questions. Alex?\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Navam. With that operator, let's go to our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I'm curious with Susan St. Ledger coming into head up sales. Is there an early sense of the extent or magnitude of the changes that you want to make to the go-to-market structure in terms of either approach or either staffing, et cetera? Because you also mentioned some changing in program spend as well. Thank you.\nDave McJannet: Hey, Sterling, thanks for the question. I think, it's really about as we step back and think about this next phase of growth in front of us. We had the unique opportunity to bring in a go-to-market leader who has done that now multiple times in multiple different companies. And so we're super excited about the opportunity, I think, candidly, that's the aspiration. It's about setting ourselves up for the next generation of scale that we certainly envision ourselves progressing through as a strong independent company and that's really what it's about. There's really nothing beyond that. Navam had alluded to some program spend changes, I think, it was just reflecting some program changes that we had made over the last quarter or so to try and keep the cost relative to the revenue line, but not related to Susan.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Sterling. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. One question I'm getting from investors is if you're kind of you're seeing customers move from commercial to open source given the budget pressures out there, Obviously, there's those dynamics in your end markets. Just I was hoping to get a sense of if you're seeing any of that or kind of what's your view on the risk of those kind of churn dynamics as you look going forward?\nDave McJannet: Hey, Derrick. It's Dave. I'll answer that one again. The short answer is no. The open source products solve a problem for an individual, the corporate commercial products solves the problem for an organization. So in a sense, they're fundamentally different products. And so, no, I think what we are seeing is very, very consistent what we've been communicating over the last couple of earnings calls, which is as Armon and I both be traveling a ton, what we're seeing at the front end is very, very consistent, in terms of interest in what we do, design when decisions being granted to us, no change to the competitive environment. . What we're really just seeing is increased scrutiny in the procurement process that is just difficult to predict as we've indicated over the last couple of calls. And much like other vendors in the market, that is putting pressure on us, but that is no different than really anybody else. What I don't hear anybody doing is changing their plans. The crypto cloud remains unabated. And I think as you sort of start to look at some of the numbers in our earnings report, you'll see we added 26 new Global 2000 customers, 32 customers over 100,000 in ARR and another quarter of strong NDE, which I think really just speaks to that consistent long-term trend and really no material change other way.\nDerrick Wood: Okay. Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Derrick. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Hey guys. I just want to try to get as much of a sense for what's changed as possible. You've held up extremely well during a period in which people have seen this type of scrutiny deal cycles extending, et cetera. And in fact, to some extent, deal cloud optimization seems to have benefited you in prior quarters. So is there anything that you feel like was inflection point here that might have determined your outlook worsening for the year?\nNavam Welihinda: Hey, Michael, it's Navam here. Thanks for the question. So in terms of what's changed, I think the main points to talk about is what's not changed is the front-end environment, which is the pipeline activity, the pipeline creation activity still remains very strong. As Dave mentioned in the call, a very healthy quarter in terms of the G2K ads, net 100K ads and total customer ads. So the activity of cloud transformation efforts, cloud efforts, all those things remain similar. What's happened in the first quarter, and this is a little bit of first quarter seasonality as well, the first quarter in a very long year. In this new budget cycle, you saw a lot of headwinds, a lot of procurement pressures in the global segment and the enterprise segment related to very, very large deals or large deals. And that's reflected in the guidance range that we've given. So that's the material change we saw in the first quarter. But the main thing to remember with these large deals, and I'll give you an example of first quarter deal that we were working on and it was held up in procurement due to some procurement process issue, ended up closing in the second quarter as a multiyear deal using several of our products. So these deals don't get lost for competitive pressures. They don't get lost because the cloud transformation effort is canceled, it just elongates and they happen when they move to -- they happen in a different quarter.\nDave McJannet: Maybe just add. This is Dave. Let me just add to kind of a subjective commentary. I think as you see on the hyperscalers, there's just a lot of -- there's a lot of scrutiny around anything related to the cloud narrative at the moment. And you see that in the hyperscaler results. And certainly, that seemed to be more acute in the quarter based on what I saw externally than in previous quarters. We are fundamentally tied to cloud transition. And that does cause things to get elongated as there's increased scrutiny on certainly the larger transactions associated with anything cloud related.\nMichael Turits: Thanks, Dave and Navam.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Michael. Next question.\nOperator: One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks, guys. I'd like to dig in into the retail customer that reduced portion of the spend. Just a few things around this. First of all, how big of a customer is it as a percent of revenue to have a two-point impact, it must be a quite significant customer, can you give some color on why the reduced spend or just not using it or didn't see value there? And Navam, would it be fair to say that without this customer, you're actually -- if I'm doing the math right, actually guiding in line to consensus for next quarter? Is that the right way to think about the magnitude?\nDave McJannet: Hey, Ittai. It's Dave. Thanks for the question. I'll let Navam answer the math side of it. I'll answer the sort of the more subjective side of it. Yes, I think, as we shared in the prepared remarks, there's a retail customer that have procured entitlements really for peak season. It's actually a really good example of what's happening in across the board around procurement and finance scrutiny. They ended up rightsizing that particular entitlement for that particular product for that particular application for the state, which is consistent with what other vendors have commented on. But in the sort of partnership that's something that we want to do with them. I would just underscore that they remain one of our largest customers. They are a multiproduct customer. We are super engaged with them. And also, it's very clear that they're very early in their cloud estate. These are big companies spend a lot of money on this category, but they're very early. So net, it was an optimization that we certainly are partners and I'll let Navam comment on the math.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, it's a large customer relationship of ours. And I think I mentioned during the prepared remarks, it was about 2% impact to our gross and net retention rates, about 1% revenue impact. In terms of the guidance, I think the guidance is reflective of the general large deal movement that we're seeing in any given quarter, rather than specific to this customer. So this customer's impact was obviously reflected in the guidance as well, but it's more a relationship in relation to what's happening in the extend large contract side and the impacts of procurement and the CFO being part of that purchasing decision more and more this quarter in this new budget cycle.\nIttai Kidron: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Ittai. Next question please.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just building off the Ittai question there. How much risk is there to other sort of large customers like this retail customer of reducing a portion of spend? What kind of guarantees you have that, that doesn't happen next quarter or the quarter after? And Navam, does this mean we should kind of expect this kind of let's call it, mid-teens kind of net retention rate in the period to continue forward? Or should we get back to that greater than 120% kind of trailing 12-month long-term target? Thanks.\nDave McJannet: Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. Yes, just really quickly on, I think we have a pretty good view of the overall customer state and I think our view is reflected in the guidance we have more generally of the guidance framework that Navam's shared. And this is a -- retail is a very specific vertical for, as you can imagine, so I don't -- I think we forget about the remainder of DC.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. In terms of the net retention rates, I'd point to there's a lot to be optimistic about after we get through this year's budget cycle, not hold right? You've still got very healthy activity on the G2K. You've got very healthy activity on the 100K. These are all expansions and extensions that happen and also multiproduct expansion -- multiproduct extensions that happened with our product portfolio and also the upcoming Boundary product, which will impact our revenue going forward. So, no, I don't think that this is a new reality of what net retention rates would be. I think it's more a reflection of the purchasing environment along with stopping sort of large contracts from proceeding to the finish line. Once these -- once this budget cycle resets into the next one, I think, we see the usual impacts of expansion extension and multiproduct purchase recovery. So our long-term targets of being above 120%, which is the target we've set remain intact, and we're very optimistic about that long-term.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've got multipart first one and then just a clarification. So I guess if we think about some of these larger contracts, these larger deals, these longer sales cycles, are you seeing like is this -- is the incremental scrutinization that's being put on these deals, is it anything to do? You mentioned, Dave, about kind of similar dynamics within the hyperscalers. Is this customers pausing on cloud migration? Is this greater focus on cloud optimization before the next phase of the journey? Like what are you seeing in that dynamic that's causing that incremental friction? And then can you comment on what you've seen kind of in the month of May and June relative to how April and maybe March trended?\nDave McJannet: Thanks, Alex. It's super interesting because it's also consistent. Like if you think about the conversations that we've been having for the last seven months, they're the same conversations we're having now, which is, hey, we're going cloud. Those plans are unabated by the Global 2000. They are not slowing down. They are engaging with us to say, yes, we've created a platform engineering function. You guys are the basis of how we do that. It's just taking us time and some friction to align the organization towards the consumption of that design win, which is already in place. I have two conversations this week, one with the massive utility, one with an insurance company where that was exactly the conversation what's happening is that those design wins are being done given the front-end consistency of the pipeline that we're seeing, what's not happening to the same degree as those things flow through procurement in some instances, it's a question of the typical plan of buying slightly ahead of demand, which is what most companies do on the entitlement side. That's what's being stopped by finance department specifically. So you want to stands to reason because we won those design wins that, that will flow through over the course of time. There's really no material change other than just literally like it's almost like if you're towing a boat behind you, the boat is a little further behind because that part needs to catch your procurement, but it's going in this direction with that question. Maybe Armon has a point of view. He traveled I think nine weeks last quarter.\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. I think maybe anecdotally, just to echo what Dave said. I think what we're seeing pretty consistently is going into this fiscal year, most of these organizations are sort of have locked their budget and the top focus for them is really an optimization and consolidation of vendors focusing on rightsizing their estates. And so I think we continue to see that translate to the procurement pressure that you're seeing, especially around the bigger deals. But that said, I think all these groups are still engaging with us on next product along really thinking about great. How do we architect tools like TerraForm and Vault into foundational layers of our platform. How do we start thinking about the other aspects of where we can help them on the automation journey. And I think in many ways, it's also accelerating the trend towards platform teams, right? Because I think these organizations are realizing if they're really going to get their hands around how do I do cloud efficiently at scale, you really need to have a central aperture for that. So I think it's exiting a lot of those order transformation and it's also accelerating the need to have standardization around the tooling. So I think all that speaks well to the pipeline and I think the activity is happening there.\nDave McJannet: I'll also just add, just to add to Armon's point, it is also occurring to a general shift towards consolidation of vendors during this cycle, which is certainly a net positive for us. As they're going through design win process, they are trying to rationalize in general, their portfolio as a multiproduct vendor, it actually it accrues very, very well to us on the design win side and as long as we make those companies successful the right things will happen over the longer term.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then what about just on the monthly cadence question?\nDave McJannet: I mean, I would suggest, normally, you know I feel it's very similar to me.\nArmon Dadgar: Yes. I don't think there's been a marked change. And I think this really speaks to the fact that these budgets are generally set on an annual basis for organizations. And I think that's reflected in our guide. I think it would be for most organizations, unusual to reset their budget midyear.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And just maybe a clarification question on the appointment of Susan to that role. Is she replacing someone? Is this a new role? Is there kind of contemplated meaningful changes to the go-to-market organization through the year, given the start in July? Just any help there would be helpful.\nDave McJannet : I'll say we're super excited about the opportunity to bring in Susan, suffice to say, it was never about her. It was always about her availability and not our lack of interest in having her play that role as someone who is very uniquely positioned to do that. And I think as we -- as I mentioned, as we think about the next phase of scale, the $1 billion number is the one ahead of us and that's certainly where our energy is pointed. And we think she's super well positioned to do that. And so we're bringing her as President of Worldwide for Field Operations. We think this is the right time to introduce that role as we think about the next phase of growth. And that is more of a decision around a role requirement for us. So beyond that, no material changes obviously her scope will be completely determined once she arrives full time in the next month. But conceptually, it's just the addition of a new role and the existing team will report it to her and obviously she'll help us grow into the next phase and beyond.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thanks, Alex. Next question. Got it. We're ready for next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGray Powell: Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Just if you can help me sort of dig into the revenue guidance more, I appreciate it. I think the full year guidance implies that you grow revenue around 11% or 12% in the second half of the year. Just how should we reconcile that against cRPO, which just grew 29%? And then how should we think about the potential for growth to reaccelerate at some point or maybe the timing of a reacceleration? I know that last one is going to be hard to call, but any color would be really appreciated.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes. Thanks, Gray. Good question on the cRPO side. So the cRPO is obviously reflective of the front half seasonality compared to the back half seasonality, right? So when you think about it, as a -- we sell large enterprise contracts, they're tail-end weighted. So the back half has a -- is a much bigger impact on our revenue than the front half from a bookings perspective. So the cRPO growth rates will differ from the front half to the back half. So there is going to be a difference between the first quarter absolute numbers, cRPO growth rate and what the full year revenue growth rate is just from a timing perspective because it implies what the bookings are for the back three quarters of -- or the back half of the year, right? So we've factored in basically continued headwinds in the global segment and the enterprise segment and how we think about the revenue guidance. Now I also caveated this is really early in the year. So we'll execute every quarter, and we'll give you updates as we move along. We're very optimistic about the front-end, especially given what we're seeing in terms of customer activity, especially given what we're seeing from the field when Armon and Dave go and visit our customers. So at some point, we're going to be out of this budget cycle. And at that point, I think we moved through normal purchasing cycles with our customer base, and that's where we feel will be back to our normal growth rates. But as Armon mentioned, the budgets are set once a year, and we're reflecting sort of the current budget environment, we're seeing until that changes and every quarter will be an update.\nGray Powell: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nAlex Kurtz: All right. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. So seeing the heaviest scrutiny coming from your -- actually your largest customers and then in the expansion is not what we would typically see. I think we would assume those are the customers that they know you, they trust you, they would -- they'd want to consume a larger footprint. Can you just double-click on that and maybe explain why we're seeing that the behavior kind of shake out that way? And then as a follow-up, so what is the current number of $10 million ARR customers as of June? Is that -- would that number be sitting at two now?\nDave McJannet: Hey, Mark, it's Dave. Let me answer the first one. Just so I understand or just so I clarify, yes, I think the procurement friction we're seeing is a general commentary inside existing customers as well as new. I think we again saw a very strong NDE in the quarter, which I think is reflective of those larger companies continuing to purchase incremental pieces from us. But certainly, the cycles for them are slower than maybe they were a year ago, just given the constraints in their own business, but that's more of a general commentary than anything. But overall, what -- exactly what I would expect and consistent.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, Mark. On the large customer side, yes, it is one of our largest customers, the current, one of our three $10 million customers slipped below the $10 million line. They still remain engaged and large, as I mentioned. So, yes, the count is there too.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Mark. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Altman with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nNick Altman: Great. Thanks, guys. There were some good upside of margins in the quarter and with the 8% head count reduction. I guess I'm a bit surprised why the margin guidance wasn't revised upward a bit more. So is there anything else there we should be thinking about or considering? And then just to clarify was the risk factored into the prior margin guidance?\nNavam Welihinda: Hey, Nick. Yes, so just to clarify, the severance related to the ripe is factored into our current Q2, which impacts some of our margins. But overall, I think our EPS is guiding better than what we had previously factored in. And also note that it takes until the back half of the year after the first and -- first quarter actuals and the second quarter severance to work its way through and really see the impacts -- the long-term impacts to your margins in the back half of the year. So that's what we're seeing in terms of the margin guidance. But that being said, our EPS guidance has ticked up and we expect to be -- apart from the second quarter seasonality, you're always going to expect a second quarter dip in free cash flow due to the first quarter ACV seasonality you should expect positive free cash flow for the rest of the year.\nAlex Kurtz: Great. Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Miller Jump with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMiller Jump: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one more to follow up on the headcount reduction. I was wondering could you give any more color on which segments of the business you plan on reducing or that you have reduced headcount in? And then maybe -- just are there any segments where you plan to continue hiring for the rest of the year. Thanks.\nDave McJannet: Actually, maybe as for the first part of the question, I'll let Navam answer the second. I just want to underscore, this is a hugely difficult decision for us to make and the one we felt that needed to be done. I just want to reflect back that we had gone through an investment cycle over the past four quarters, very deliberately, with an expectation of a certain demand environment to be in place and clearly, that different demand environment did not materialize, obviously with sales cycles extending just like for everybody else. But I want to make clear that because of that investment cycle, we feel like we're in a good position to deliver on the capacity required to deliver this year and next. So while certainly, there were modifications across all sectors. We feel good about the capacity that remains across all segments required to do what we need to do, both in R&D and in sales.\nNavam Welihinda: Yes, right. Echoing Dave, this is a very difficult decision for us and not something we took lightly. We took many steps to impact spend before going down this path. And ultimately, we still are a growth company, so we want to make sure we're invested in the long-term. And we were very careful in the large impacts when you think about the large organizations, which are sales and R&D. We maintained our investments in where we felt we needed the capacity. And in several geos or in certain products where we thought the payback was a little longer term. We took the action of understanding what the criticality of that business is and trimming it down. So overall, we are still very well staffed from a sales and R&D perspective to both deliver the quarters and also deliver the product road map. And we feel that the headcount that we have or the employee base that we have this quarter is sufficient for the year. So we don't feel like we're going to add unless the environment materially changes.\nMiller Jump: Understood. Thanks for the color.\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Hey, guys. I asked ChatGPT, what questions have not been asked by Mark Murphy and Alex Zukin. And it timed out. So I have to just be thinking on my own here. In seriousness, when you look at the net expansion rate, is the pressure coming from existing customers expanding more? Or is it because of existing customers cutting down scope of the deployment? If you can just give some color? And also, is there a way to triangulate, is that coming from TerraForm or non-TerraForm out of the house, that would be great? And also, Susan, obviously, has got a great track, but she was at Salesforce had market in cloud, she at Splunk, President of Worldwide Operations and I believe something pretty close to that Okta, very, very different business, very different products. What do you want Susan to accomplish for Hashi with respect to the [Technical Difficulty] Do you think she brings in that is so critical for Hashi at this stage of the game? Thank you so much.\nDave McJannet: Hey, Kash. This is Dave. I'll answer the first one. I think I got it, and I'll try to get to the second. I think my observation is it's largely around the net new expansion pace. It's the rebuy cycle just because of that procurement pressure that we're seeing. Once deployed, our products are on the runtime positive applications and that makes them generally long relationships with our customers, notwithstanding small acquisitions here and there. So generally speaking, the NDE is notwithstanding the one thing that the one customer that Navam referred to is just sort of a slight slowdown in the rebuy of next use case long next product along. In terms of Susan, I think we're cognizant of phase shifts of a company, and we think about the next phase ahead, and it is an operationally different phase at $1 billion in revenue, and that's really where we think is going to help us as a put to any specific about our product portfolio or type of go to market. It's -- there are very few people in the world available to do that, and she is at the very, very top of that list. So it's more generally a scaling question for us as a company. As you can see, our customers are among large companies in the planet, we play a critical role for them. They're going cloud, and that is not shifting and our relationships will be extremely long as a result, and we want to build the best possible companies to support them.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thank you so much and all the best.\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you, Kash. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. Hey, Armon, at the beginning of the year, you were talking about how budget is aggregated across three [indiscernible] and data, and you thought there was a lot more variability in apps and data. How are you thinking about that division today? Is it still a helpful way to think about the business?\nArmon Dadgar: Hey, Pat. Thanks for the question. I think that still is a useful way. And I think what we see in all these accounts is at the infrastructure layer, all of these teams are still committed to cloud, they're still moving ahead. I think they're taking sort of a moment to pause a beat, look at hey over the last three, four years, spending on cloud has been gangbusters, where is there opportunity to optimize and consolidate and drive a little bit of efficiency in these states. I think what we broadly see is a fairly large amount of waste in the cloud environment. But I think no one is really divesting from cloud as a strategy, right? So our view is it's like everyone is pausing taking a beat to do that optimization, but really forging ahead on sort of a multi-cloud strategy. And I think in that sense, we expect infrastructure will sort of take that pause and then continue the growth as people move there. If anything, I think where we feel some optimism is, I think, with a lot of customers who are now interested in leveraging some of the generative AI techniques, we actually think those will be drivers of net new cloud workload. And we're already seeing that. There's a very large financial group we've been working with, who has dramatically pulled forward and accelerated their efforts to get on to Azure for exactly that purpose. So that's bringing net new workload, expanding them to multi-cloud and they're using Terraform and Vault and Console to underpin that multi-cloud journey. So I think in that sense, we feel like there's going to be this optimization that we're seeing broadly across the market that will take a pause, and then we'll continue to see workloads on cloud continue to grow at that infrastructure layer.\nPatrick Walravens: All right. Great. Thank you. And Navam can I just -- as a follow-up how confident are you in your -- revenue guidance?\nNavam Welihinda: Hey, Pat. So yes, I think we're very confident about our new revenue guidance. It factors in this elongated large contract cycle into the rest of the year. And as Armon said, we're optimistic about not losing out due to competitive pressure or losing out due to cancellation of the cloud program. So we expect this large contract activity to occur as they will for the next three quarters. But as soon as the headwinds change, we should see return to normal. But the full year is reflecting our confidence in what we can achieve next year or this year.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Pat. Next question.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for squeezing me in. I had a question for Dave or Armon. I guess I'll jump ball and it goes to the rightsizing of the environment, Armon that you mentioned in the previous question. In your conversations with your customers, when you talk -- when they talk about optimizing their environment, rightsizing your environment, could you give us a sense of what that entails? And from the feedback that you've gotten, how long does a rightsizing initiative or project take from what you're hearing from your customer base?\nArmon Dadgar: Hey, Sanjit. Thanks for the question. It's a really good question. So I think the shape of it takes a few different forms, right? I think part of it, what we see is you have development testing environments that have been relatively unconstrained and some customers might be as much as 50% of their cloud spend. So I think there's one side of this, which is really looking through those dev test environments and a whole lot of it is orphaned resources, things that developers went up an environment left or running for three months, you're paying the meter on that. So I think there's a lot of that happening in dev test, where that takes -- you have to go through an inventory process, identify those workloads and shut them down. Then I think on the other side, you have a production environment where you have kind of multiple forms of voice take place. One is, hey, maybe this needs to run on five servers that's really running on 10. Okay, can we identify that and sort of shrink the footprint down to five. You have other cases where it's like I'm running on a double extra-large when really I should be on a kind of a medium-sized capacity. So I think that also is a complex challenge, if you have to inventory all the assets really look through data and telemetry to understand where am I overutilized, where am I over deployed and then go through the change management to kind of rightsize some of that. In terms of how long that takes, I think there's a fair amount of variability and frankly, it actually goes back to the maturity of their cloud program. The programs that were leased mature, they don't have a good handle on it. The data is not readily available to them. They don't have a central team that was responsible for driving that in a standardized way. And I think, in fact, this has been an accelerant of conversations for us around the value of standardizing on tools like TerraForm and having a platform team because that central aperture gives me visibility of what workloads are dev test, what workloads their production. It allows you to kind of do that instrumentation on usage. So for us, it's actually been a useful conversation driver on the importance of creating those sort of standardized layers. I think with the teams and organizations that don't have that, it's a longer journey, right? They have to sort of get their hands around problem and there's multiple phases of identification, rightsizing and change management.\nDave McJannet: If I could add just my other comments, Sanjit. I think to me, it's kind of two countervailing forces. One, as Armon described, there's -- we see it -- obviously, we're doing it ourselves. There's a lot of clean-up of those orphan environments that we're all paying for and overspend, and so that is driving consumption down. At the same time, the velocity of new things going to cloud is not slowing. So at the same time, as that is coming down, you're seeing an increase in the slope of the line of new things going cloud. So in a sense, it's getting offset a little bit. And ultimately, TerraForm is a critical element of how people actually solve that problem by putting constraints in from the provisioning process. The irony being, you have to get to the procurement function to put that in place, but that is certainly what people are doing.\nSanjit Singh: That's really helpful context. And it seems to align broadly with how the hyperscalers are talking about how that's manifesting in our environment as well. And ultimately, we get to a place where new workload growth hopefully outpaces or surpasses the impact from optimization. So that's encouraging. I had one follow-up for Navam and it goes back to the previous question around like your confidence in the guide. I hear you guys loud and clear in terms of the longer sales cycles and the procurement process. We do have a new sales leader in place. And so I wanted to understand like in terms of the magnitude of change in terms of the blocking and tackling of sales, territory alignment, comp, how much change is being instituted in the sales organization, at a time where we've had a risk and then also the environment is a little bit weaker. So I just wanted to understand like the magnitude of those changes and whether that creates incremental execution risk this year?\nNavam Welihinda: Thanks, Sanjit. The short answer is no. We don't see incremental execution risk with the addition of Susan. And in fact, we're optimistic about or impacts of the company and how she could help us grow into this new stage. Just as a reminder, when we took this very carefully considered workforce reduction, we didn't overly impair the capacity in our core regions where digital transformation is the most advanced or the most furthest along. Rather, we looked at where the geos were that potentially were longer-term investments, and we rightsize those a little bit. And those were the margin impacts that we saw on the workforce reduction plan. The existing sales leadership still is intact, and they will, as a unit report up to Susan. So the org still is very stable, and we feel like there's no incremental risks with the change, no incremental organizational risks with the change.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. I appreciate the context. Thank you.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks, Sanjit\nOperator: Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Dave McJannet for any further remarks.\nDave McJannet: I'd just like to express my thanks for the participation from everyone here, and we certainly appreciate you dialing in and for all the questions. Look forward to speaking to everybody soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
