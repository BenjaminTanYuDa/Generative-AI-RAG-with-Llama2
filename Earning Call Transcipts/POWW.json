All this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Participants on this call are advised that the audio of this conference call is being broadcast live over the Internet and is also being recorded for playback purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Blazei of CoreIR, the company's Investor Relations firm. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt Blazei: Good afternoon, and thank you for participating in today's conference call. Joining me from AMMO's leadership team are Fred Wagenhals, Executive Chairman; Jared Smith, Chief Executive Officer; and Rob Wiley, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including statements that address AMMO's expectations for future performance or operational results. Forward-looking statements involve risks and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information about these risks, please refer to the risk factors described in AMMO's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the company's press release that accompanies this call, particularly the cautionary statements in it. Today's conference call includes non-GAAP financial measures that AMMO believes can be useful in evaluating its performance. You should not consider this additional information in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net loss, its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the reconciliation table located in the company's earnings press release. The content of this call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today, February 8, 2024. Except as required by law, AMMO disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any information to reflect events or circumstances that occur after this call. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to AMMO's Chief Executive Officer, Jared Smith.\nJared Smith: Good afternoon, everyone. Calendar 2023 was a challenging year for our industry and for the U.S. economy. Despite this backdrop, AMMO continued to transition its business to a stronger and leaner operating model as we push through this very tough economic period. We have emerged from this time with an impeccable balance sheet, and we are encouraged about the significant opportunities we have before us here in the fourth quarter and going forward. We recently announced a $10-plus million brass contract with ZRODelta and continue to see increasing demand as the ammunition and firearms market recovers from the 2022 and 2023's post-pandemic slump. Now turning to our third quarter. We generated $5.1 million in cash this quarter, mostly through a reduction of inventories by $3.5 million. We will continue to work through inventory reductions as the year progresses. Third quarter revenues were up $1.6 million sequentially, but net loss was dramatically improved to a loss of $1.6 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $7.5 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $4.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by a nearly 600 basis point sequential increase in gross margins due to decreases in tooling expenses, cost-cutting initiatives and higher traffic on the GunBroker.com marketplace. We are seeing a stronger pull-through here in January and are optimistic as we grow our capacities for rifle case production as we expect to return to profitability during the 2025 fiscal year. In addition, our Marketplace division continues its upward trend with seasonal sales continuing to increase here in Q4. GunBroker.com successfully tested our centralized payment processing application this quarter, and we will take our multi-item cart live on or before April 1. The payment application for checkout will support credit card processing for over 80% of our business, and we will continue to onboard sellers throughout the year as we develop the rest of the platform to onboard the remaining 20% of our business. As we've said in the past, this is the first major step in our evolution and our transition from an eBay auction house to the Amazon eBay of the outdoor shooting sports industry. The launch of our cart will drive subsequent evolutions of the platform as we enable tiered category fees, cross-selling, shipping, financing, a better user experience, enhanced search functionality and much more. Now I'd like to transition to the Ammunition division. We continue to see strong demand for our products and continue to bring on rifle capacity. While the transition has been slower than desired with our rifle brass production, we now have the lines in place to start seeing acceleration this quarter and into fiscal year 2025. We invested $3.6 million in CapEx projects this year, and our cost-out initiatives will result in a savings of $1.75 million, which will start to take effect this quarter, but with real effect in our 2025 fiscal year. We are well on our way into the rebranding of our Ammunition portfolio and have focused our efforts on premium pistol and rifle ammunition, repositioning our core brands, STREAK, Signature, StelTH and the launch of our HUNT line. This rebranding will carry through to our packaging website, in-store and online displays with our new HUNT line hitting shelves in early summer, while STREAK, StelTH and Signature lines are hitting stores now. I'm also proud to announce we recently onboarded Paul Kosowski [ph], our new Chief Compliance and Transformation Officer. Paul will be helping us drive greater compliance and ensuring our business stays in the black as we maneuver in these regulated markets. As we look at opportunities going into fiscal 2025, we will focus on the transformation of our marketplace. We will also continue to transition our manufacturing model to one of pursuing higher margins and premium rifle and pistol ammunition opportunities as well as embracing the growing OEM business. I will now hand the call off to Rob Wiley, our CFO, to walk us through our third quarter financials.\nRob Wiley: Thank you, Jared. Welcome, everyone. Let me now review the financials of the third quarter of our 2024 fiscal year in more detail. We experienced an improvement in the marginality of our Ammunition segment, while the margins of the GunBroker.com Marketplace segment remained strong. We continue to see positive demand trends building for our ammunition product and activity continued to increase on GunBroker.com as we enter into the final quarter of our fiscal year. We ended the third quarter with total revenues of approximately $36 million in comparison to $38.7 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in revenue was related to a decrease in sales activity from our Ammunition segment as a result of a change in the U.S. commercial ammunition market from the comparable prior quarter. Our casing sales, however, which afford us higher gross margins increased to $4.7 million, up from $3 million in the prior year period. Our marketplace revenue was $14 million for the reported quarter, compared to $15.4 million in the prior year quarter, which decreased as a result of the current macroeconomic environment impacting our industry as well as others. Cost of goods sold was approximately $25.1 million for the quarter compared to $26.2 million in the comparable prior year quarter. The decrease in cost of goods sold was related to the decrease in sales volume. Our gross margins for the quarter were $10.9 million or 30.3% compared to $12.5 million or 32.4% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was related to the shift in our sales mix. Our cost cutting measures are paying off. There was a 5.4% decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales from the prior year quarter adjusted to exclude non-recurring expenses. There are approximately $1.5 million of non-recurring expenses related to legal and professional fees, which we have included as an add-back to adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we recorded adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5.4 million compared to the prior year quarter adjusted EBITDA of $6.2 million. This resulted in a net loss per share of $0.02, or adjusted net income per share of $0.04 compared to the prior year quarter of net loss per share of $0.04 or adjusted net income per share of $0.04. Our improvement to our marketplace GunBroker.com progresses as our cart platform is on schedule to launch on April 1. We purchased approximately 145,000 shares of our common stock under our repurchase plan in the reported quarter, bringing us to just over 1.3 million shares repurchased in total under the plan. That concludes our opening remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Matt Koranda with Roth MKM. Please go ahead.\nMatt Koranda: Hey guys, good afternoon. Maybe just a few on the AMMO business first, and then we’ll cover GunBroker, but maybe just talk about the drivers of brass revenue in the quarter. They fell off a bit sequentially, obviously up a bunch year-over-year. Maybe just talk about sort of the puts and takes around, why that fell on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And then where should that volume be headed in the fourth quarter and beyond? I know you mentioned it as a meaningful driver, but just any additional color that we can kind of think about as it pertains to brass volume.\nJared Smith: Absolutely. Thank you for the question, Matt. Yes, our brass came back online back in November, but really we held back some brass for our own internal loading to meet future production as we launched our HUNT lines. And we’re making sure that we’ve got some brass available that will pass-through production over the course of the next quarter to two quarters. Brass sales are strong, great pipeline, production – more capacity is coming online every day. It’s still a great play for us and it was really just holding back inventories for our own loading.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. And then maybe just talk about the levers, Jared, that you have at your disposal here to get that gross margin into the positive territory in the fourth quarter. Nice improvement on a sequential basis. I assume it’s kind of a combination of a mix of more brass sales pricing, firming up in the loaded round side of things, but maybe just unpack a bit more for us in terms of how you’re thinking about getting to positive gross margins in the fourth quarter.\nJared Smith: Our brass production Matt is still less than 30% of the total capacity that we have. So it’s really about continuing to build out those brass lines. We saw a sequential price decrease, reduction in tooling cost, reduction in material for our entire brass casings division as we push more into these larger calibers. As I just mentioned, we landed a very large contract in conjunction with zero delta on the 50 cal, 12.7 X 108 line. That’s a further big margin play for us going into 2024. We’ll continue to press on these larger calibers as more capacity comes online. We think price out there on the market is fairly healthy. Inventories are healthy. We see positive trends ahead.\nMatt Koranda: Does that mean we can expect positive gross margins in the AMMO business in the fourth quarter?\nJared Smith: I think we’re going to be well on our way to breakeven our positive gross margins in the fourth quarter. We’re super confident on our ability to start cranking out more and more brass. This 12.7 contract, it’s really about making sure that those start dates are on target. But yes, we’re confident whether it’s Q4 or our Q1 2025 fiscal year.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. All right. Helpful. And then just turn into GunBroker, I guess I’m curious. The obvious question is GMV looks like it was down year-over-year. Despite if you look at mix and sort of the surge in activity that we saw in terms of the primary firearms market, it was up at least in October and November. I think kind of marginally positive in December even. So, just any help on the differential there for you guys versus mix? Why do you didn’t necessarily see as much of the pickup? It’d just be helpful to kind of get the understanding for the business.\nJared Smith: What I think the question that you asked was why were we not up as high as mix? Is that the right way to look at it?\nMatt Koranda: Yes, yes. Exactly.\nJared Smith: Okay. GunBroker is a resource for this industry and when there’s an abundance of guns on the shelf, they’re not necessarily running down and going to GunBroker as often. We still saw positive trends. We continue to see positive trends going into Q4. You got to remember, we haven’t really delivered to our marketplace enhanced checkout features, and we see that as a big upside for us going into Q1 of 2025 as we rollout the multi-item cart and checkout process.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. All right. Got you. I guess just last one on GunBroker, what are the last hurdles that you have to clear to get to the payments and carting initiative on April 1? I mean, it's coming up pretty fast here, a little over a month away. Maybe just discuss any additional items that need to be tackled. And I did hear, I guess, if I heard you correctly, did you say honor before? What are some of the things that could happen to swing you before April 1 in terms of getting to carding?\nJared Smith: Honestly, we just need a few more weeks of testing. We'd like to see a couple Sundays of higher volume traffic. There's not really anything that's keeping us. It's just making sure that when we do roll it out, it rolls out successfully. I can't speak to really any one impediment that keeps us from going live.\nMatt Koranda: Okay, great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.\nJared Smith: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mark Smith with Lake Street. Please go ahead.\nMark Smith: Hi, guys. First one for me, just wanted to ask about this recent contract. Jared, I don't know if you can give us any additional details or if you can quantify maybe what margin or profitability on this contract business would be like kind of versus your typical ammo or typical brass casing business.\nJared Smith: Absolutely. Well, it's a little bit of a mixed bag on the margin, because we're still seeing overheads across the entire ammunition business or across our entire factory, a little higher than we would like. So with turning this line on, I mean, based upon our estimates, there's a 40% margin, plus 40% margin on this play. It's 6 million pieces. We will be producing this well into the first part of 2025 calendar year. It's a strong 40% margin play just on those cases.\nMark Smith: Perfect. And then it looked like the proprietary ammo had a little better sales during the quarter than I'd expected. Was that just some of the new branding and shipping, some of maybe stuff in new boxes or things that looked a little better in the quarter?\nJared Smith: It's a little bit of the rebranding. We're really hitting our stride on the rebranding just now. Shipments are going out on the black and yellow boxes that have a better presence. I would tell you that I think it's a big part of market recovery. The sales team really hit its stride in Q4, we've got a really strong team that is out. And I think people are starting to recognize the AMMO, Inc. brand again. The pricing out there is healthier than it was in Q2 and Q3 or in Q1 and Q2.\nMark Smith: Okay. Next question for me is just looking at ammo margin here, still tough, but I'm curious if you can dive into it a little bit more, how much of that was maybe, we'll call it, one-time-ish in nature with the press still being down versus just kind of headwinds that are out there in the industry. In particular, for loaded ammo, what are you seeing for powder propellant and any other kind of costs that are hurting margin right now?\nJared Smith: There is certainly a constraint for propellant. I think the market is going to see that constraint more and more as the year goes on. I think that's going to impact some of the smaller players more than the bigger players. As we look into kind of the one-time plays, I mean, once again, as I said earlier, we're still at less than 30% capacity of our rifle production, and there is a massive capacity still sitting there as we bring it on, more and more capacity day by day. So that's really where our margin creation comes from. And then I think the inventory levels out there in the U.S. market are relatively healthy despite it being an election year. I think people are coming off of this kind of post 2022-2023 slump. We came out of shot show and talking to all the retailers and dealers out there, everybody's pretty confident about what we're seeing in the market.\nMark Smith: Okay, the last question for me, this new contract is certainly a positive, curious across the board for your business, kind of how you feel about contract business. You've got, I think, you call it, your signature on target happy and happy rounds. Just curious any update on kind of your outlook on military or global contract business?\nJared Smith: It's really, really solid and we've held off on taking large contracts, because we wanted real internal proof of performance before we go sign on to any larger deals. I mean, there's no lack of ability for us to go out and get multi-year contracts, but we really wanted to perform first. And I think some of our clients are waiting for us to perform first before they start sending in more orders. They know it's a new factory. They know we can produce premium rifle cases and cartridges. But once again, they want to see the proof before they bet the entire future of their supply lines honor. And so I think we're gaining that confidence back day by day. And we'll start taking those larger contracts, such as this 12.7 x 108 contract that we just took.\nMark Smith: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJared Smith: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jared Smith for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJared Smith: I want to thank you all for participating on today's call and your interest in AMMO, Inc. We look forward to sharing our progress when we report our fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results in June. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to AMMO’s Chief Executive Officer, Jared Smith.\nJared Smith: Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter was a very difficult quarter for our industry, which had been previously anticipated and reported by our major competitors. With that said, the market is moving very quickly due to recent international and domestic events. From our perspective, we continue to transition our business to a leaner and more profitable operating model and remain focused on addressing operational inefficiencies. Of note, during our fiscal second quarter for which we report today, we incurred $3.9 million of non-recurring expenses due to legal and professional fees, payments incurred upon change in control and accruals or contingencies from activity originating in the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years. There was an additional $0.9 million stock compensation expense due to the change in control activities and $0.4 million write-offs of deposits from the 2022 fiscal year. These actions, while not favorable in the quarter, allow us to move forward without the burden of prior fiscal year activities. We believe that these actions are illustrative of the necessary adjustments that we believe are necessary to transition AMMO, Inc. for greater transparency and profitability in the years to come. On a positive note, we lowered our working inventory by $1.3 million, created $9.9 million in cash and reduced working capital by $8.9 million since year-end. Revenues were flat sequentially, but profitability suffered as we cleared out slow moving inventory at a loss so that future reporting quarters could be clean and a true measure of the changes we are making. We believe these strategic moves were timely as recent international events have created strong tailwinds for the ammunition division. And we are beginning to see increased traffic and conversion to GunBroker.com as our enhancements are beginning to pay off. This past quarter, GunBroker.com has successfully launched its centralized payment processing gateway and is now onboarding sellers as anticipated. This is the first major step in our evolution to a multi-item cart and streamlining the checkout process as we transition from an auction house to an Amazon-like model with auction functionality. In line with our expectations, we experienced a sequential decline in sales in Q2 from the previous quarter, tracking $1.4 million down in top line revenue. This decline in sales was anticipated and we are now starting to see the lift in our sales for Q3, including a 14.7% sequential increase in volume through our platform in October versus September, which is in line with seasonal trends in the current macro environment. This acceleration is amplified as we onboard new sellers and users begin to experience OutdoorPay for the first time, which is our centralized payment processing platform and escrow service. We have onboarded 2,826 sellers since we went live with OutdoorPay. We remain very enthusiastic about the progress and outlook for GunBroker.com. Now, let me turn our attention to some specifics on our ammunition division. Tough news is best served straight. As with any transition year with a new management team, we have taken certain steps to clean up our inventories, books and outstanding debts and liabilities. While we anticipated a rough market, we also took substantial margin losses on slow-moving inventory as we cleaned up our stocks. In context, the ammunition market in our Q2, as reported by other publicly traded companies, was well below our already low expectations. With this backdrop, our results were further impacted because the major investments we’ve made in contact tooling for brass production equipment did not come online in the quarter and our overhead absorption for the plant suffered. This is by no means from a lack of demand, but due to the mechanical and electrical failure of our primary presses for our rifle case production. While we initiated the investments for mechanical and electrical failure redundancy, we did not have the investments in place to keep our workforce and the downstream process operational. This led to an additional $1.75 million in expenses for the quarter. Of the $1.75 million, there is roughly $800,000 in tool expenses incurred in the quarter that will help offset future cost as these presses come back online. The fundamentals of our transition to OEM brass sales become even more crucial in our go-to-market strategy as our demand for products exceeds our current industrial throughput due to these mechanical and supply issues we experienced in the quarter. We expect to see strong demand and high margin growth in future quarters, but we are roughly a quarter behind where we thought we would be by now. On a positive note, we have brought on an additional 132 new domestic ammunition customers and continue to sign new OEM customers for supply of rifle and pistol brass. Events around the world have driven demand for our product offerings and we are increasing the output of the facility to continue that CapEx. While our highest margin presses continue to sit idle, we have not set idle over the last quarter. We have expanded brass sales by 47% compared to this quarter last year and brass sales now make up 30% of total sales, a 27% increase over last year. Although I am disappointed with our performance this quarter, these trends reinforce my confidence in the strategic direction of our ammunition business. Since we last reported our earnings in August, we’ve seen the international market increase its demand for our products. And due to recent news of further consolidation in our industry, coupled with limited sales of 5.56 into the commercial market from Lake City, we simply cannot have been down at a worse time. Events in October have completely flipped the market on its head and we see a return to revenue growth and improved margins in both the brass and loaded ammunition market today. GunBroker.com is starting to see the payoff of carting and payment processing capabilities on the platforms. We continue to add talent to our team and recently brought on industry veteran, Paul Schreiner, to help us recruit and retain talent in our organization. The turnaround is in place and bearing fruit, albeit with more bumps along the way than we hoped. I look forward to better results in our fiscal third quarter and the remainder of the year. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Rob Wiley, to review the second quarter results in more detail. Rob?\nRob Wiley: Thank you, Jared. Welcome everyone. Let me now review the financials of the second quarter of our 2024 fiscal year in more detail. The margins in our marketplace segment remained strong. And although our gross margins have decreased in our ammunition segment, due to the aforementioned operational struggles, we are optimistic on the future performance of this segment. While challenges continue in the market today, demand for our brass casings remained robust. We are beginning to see positive trends in the demand for our ammunition products and we are seeing the activity on GunBroker.com increase as we enter into our third fiscal quarter. We are positioned to capitalize on these positive trends, given our strong financial position as we have reported $129.5 million in current assets including $49.6 million of cash and cash equivalents in comparison to $27.6 million in current liabilities. Additionally, we have generated $18.2 million in cash from operations through the midpoint of our fiscal year. We ended the first quarter with total revenues of approximately $34.4 million in comparison to $48.3 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in revenue was primarily related to a decrease in sales activity from our ammunition segment as a result of the state of the U.S. commercial ammunition market during the reporting quarter. Our casing sales, however, which afford us higher gross margins, increased to $6.4 million, up from $4.3 million in the prior year period. Our marketplace revenue was $12.5 million for the reported quarter compared to $14.6 million in the prior year quarter, which decreased as a result of the current macroeconomic environment impacting our industry as well as others. Cost of goods sold was approximately $26.1 million for the quarter compared to $35.5 million in the comparable prior year quarter. The decrease in cost of goods sold was related to the decrease in sales volume. Our gross margin for the quarter was $8.3 million or 24.1% compared to $12.8 million or 26.6% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was related to the shift in our sales mix, but was also related to higher costs associated with our manufacturing process in our ammunition segment. Primarily, our cost absorption suffered due to the setbacks we experienced as a result of the rifle casing presses going down in the reported quarter. There were approximately $3.9 million of nonrecurring expenses related to legal and professional fees and also accruals for contingencies from activities commencing in our 2021 and 2022 fiscal years. There was also $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense as a result of change in control and also $0.4 million of write-offs incurred in our second fiscal quarter. All of these items among others are included as add-backs to adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we recorded adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million compared to the prior year quarter adjusted EBITDA of $5.7 million. This resulted in a net loss per share of $0.07 or adjusted net income per share of $0.00, compared to the prior year period of a net loss per share of $0.01 and adjusted net income per share of $0.04. We continue to push forward on the improvements to our marketplace GunBroker.com. We have formally launched OutdoorPay, our payment processing platform and are in the process of onboarding our user base to this platform, which will enable us to launch our cart platform soon thereafter. We repurchased approximately 198,000 shares of our common stock under our repurchase plan in the reported quarter, bringing us just over 1.2 million shares repurchased in total under the plan. That concludes our opening remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank You.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Matt Koranda with ROTH.\nMike Zabran: Hey guys. It’s Mike Zabran on for Matt. Maybe just starting on the ammo segment, how sustainable is the uptick and demand that we saw in October? Has demand sustained at that same level since then? And I guess, just as a result, have we seen wholesale pricing change much?\nJared Smith: Matt, great question. We’re seeing wholesale pricing because the event happened just before the NASGW event, we’re seeing wholesale pricing increase slightly. There’s a lot of optimism out in the market out there that this price is going to hold going into the election year. We’re certainly optimistic for the trends that we’re seeing. And we continue to see opportunistic buys out there that says that price continues to escalate. So, do we think it will -- that this is a long-term hold? We think there is a strategic repricing that’s happening going into the 2024 year.\nMike Zabran: And any calibers in specific were noticing pricing changing much or just kind of across the board?\nJared Smith: Yes. So I mean, the stuff that everybody’s running for is 5.56 and 223, 7.62 by 39, all your larger rifle calibers, anything related to military calibers, because of the news between Israeli and Hamas. But I would say across the board we’re getting increased demand and increased inquiries on bringing on new customers.\nMike Zabran: And core ammo margins flipped back negative in 2Q. I know we talked about and referenced the rifle casings, press are going down, but is the sequentially worse gross margin coming entirely from lack of cost absorption on the casing side? Just trying to gauge, did both loaded ammo and casings have sequentially worse gross margins or was that just from the casings side of the business?\nJared Smith: We only really took a gross margin hit in some slow moving products that we really were sitting on too much of leftover from ‘22. We flushed all that inventory out. We’ve not seen any price erosion on brass casings, and we’ve not seen any price erosion on 9 and 223. It was flushing out inventory. And back in June, when our press didn’t come online the first time, we had made strategic purchases of contact tooling bunters, another tooling that we expense upon receiving. And month after month that press did not come online. And so that contact tooling and those expenses continue to flow in. And that’s really the major hit to our profitability in the ammunition division.\nMike Zabran: Last one for me. Maybe it’s on GunBroker. Good to see the payment processing finalized. Maybe just remind us on how to think about the magnitude of the benefit to take rate and how we should expect to see take rate climb in the coming quarters as a result?\nJared Smith: Well, the take rate we see climbing somewhere between 1% to 3% as we capture credit card fees. You’re also going to see an uptick just due to the sheer seasonality that we see over GunBroker, but that doesn’t really affect the take rate. We’re also seeing our take rate -- what’s the word I’m looking for? Well, the main effect is that you’re going to see somewhere between a 1% to 3% in our take rate over the next, 3.5 to 4 months as we onboard these new sellers.\nMike Zabran: And last quick one. Is carting live? I thought I heard you reference benefits from it on the prepared remarks.\nJared Smith: We are not carting yet. What’s happening right now is we’re onboarding those sellers through our payment gateway and centralized processing, and carting will not come on until we finish onboarding all our sellers.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Smith with Lake Street. Please go ahead.\nMark Smith: A bunch of things to walk through here. First, this may be hit a little deeper on the demand environment that we saw in October. Can you just talk a little bit about maybe the consumer demand first? How much you saw that uptick. And did you see that -- maybe what the impact was within your GunBroker business? I think that you said that -- you quantified was at 14.7% sequentially, but that was the typical seasonality. Walk us through kind of what you’re seeing on the ground with consumers.\nJared Smith: So we would expect anywhere between a 5% to 6% increase and a gentle trend coming from September into October. This was a pretty sharp trend in that 14.7%. And that’s really because these events happened in the second half of October, it was really sharp incline after the events in Israel and Hamas that we saw the uptick. I think I answered only one of two of your two-part question. So, please repeat.\nMark Smith: Yes. Maybe just elaborate on that. Are you seeing demand -- that demand, is that primarily on firearms or is that spread across firearms, ammunition and kind of other accessories?\nJared Smith: It’s spread across firearms and ammunition. And we’re certainly seeing an increase in ammunition sales on the platform, in those calendars. [Ph]\nMark Smith: Okay. And then the other piece of increased demand, maybe walk us through what you’re seeing from OEM customers for brass casings. So you’re seeing that demand uptick significantly in October as well? And I don’t know if there’s anything you can quantify around that.\nJared Smith: The issue being is that we’ve been sold out for quite a while, Mark. And until these presses come online, we’re not really wanting to take any new orders because we need to make sure that we’re getting the orders that we have on our books and that we are supplying our customers that placed orders back in March, April, and May, when we forecasted that this new press was coming online. So that’s our biggest issue. We could go out and take on 200 million, 300 million more brass case capacity, but the demand today that exceeds our output is really in a rifle case capacity, and that’s where we’ve had a shortfall in operational efficiencies.\nMark Smith: And then on that, as we think about these gun rifle process, these equipment issues that you had, where are we at today versus maybe where we were at the end of the quarter or mid quarter?\nJared Smith: Yes. Great question. So back in April, when we started to do the walkthrough of the new plant, we recognized that we didn’t have the redundancy that we needed. So, we bought additional presses, but those presses won’t come online until December. The press that went down, the parts showed up last week, we’re running and testing off this week. Once again, it’s not from a lack of demand, it’s not from a lack of everybody pulling together, trying to get this press up and running, this press was bought during COVID. Some of the parts were made during COVID. And the parts that are being made today are being made by the original equipment manufacturer versus when they outsource the parts for these. And so, we think we have a press that we can count on going forward. But the last three to four months of sending the parts back and forth and trying to get the parts to work has been a very frustrating experience for everybody on the team.\nMark Smith: And maybe the last one, and then I can go back into…\nJared Smith: One of the things that’ll help explain this press, this press is part of our pre form process and it feeds about six other presses downstream. So it’s not like a single press goes down and you just work around that press. It is the feeder press for our entire medium action line, which we have somewhere in 90 million to 120 million piece capacity on. So, it’s a big deal for us and has been.\nMark Smith: The last piece here maybe for me, and I can jump back and if any other, is as we think about the profitability that was impacted by kind of clearing out, we’ll call it, aged or not as current of inventory. I don’t know if you can quantify anything else there around how big of an impact that had in the quarter. And then, also do you feel like you got through that process during the quarter, or is there still some remaining loaded ammo that may go out at lower margin or maybe even loss as we roll into Q3?\nJared Smith: No. At this point going forward, we’ve cleared out our old inventory. Part of our push to get that older inventory out is that our overheads are calculated on goods sold. So because we had such a hit on our overhead from not running the rifle presses, we pushed really hard at margins that we didn’t even want to take, but the bleeding should be over now and we’re off to a better footing.\nMark Smith: Maybe, Jared, I don’t know if you still got me, but you said taking price up. Was that kind of post quarter end?\nJared Smith: I mean, what we’re seeing, yes. That’s post quarter end. We’re seeing demand in 2024 that allows us at least a little bit of breathing room. You’re not seeing as much price margin compression as you’ve seen in the past.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jared Smith for any closing remarks.\nJared Smith: I just want to thank everybody for participating on today’s call and your interest in AMMO, Inc. We look forward to sharing ongoing progress when we report our fiscal third quarter 2024 results early next year. I appreciate the investors sticking with us, and just want to wish you all a good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amal's Executive Chairman, Fred Wagenhals.\nFred Wagenhals: Thank you, and good afternoon. I appreciate everyone joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I would like to begin this call by welcoming Jared Smith as the new Chief Executive Officer of AMMO Inc. The Board, executive management team, and I believe that Jared's background and success in the ammunition industry combined with his strategic vision for our next phase of growth will be instrumental to build greater shareholder value. We look forward to working with him and are confident and energized -- he will guide moto future successes. As the company's original founder, I will continue to be engaged on a daily basis as the Executive Chairman of the Board and will work very closely with Jared assist in this transition. As many of you on this call are aware, Jarrett has been with Amos since January 2023 as President and Chief Operating Officer. Until his recent appointment as CEO, I look forward to remaining a strong voice in the execution of our strategic plan and will stay until the job is finished. I believe the markets are significantly undervalued the opportunities in front of us. I am proud of what we've built since I founded this company just 7 years ago, and we'll continue to make sure our stakeholders understand exactly what the vision of AMMO is in what we are working towards. I'm optimistic our value has nowhere but to go but up. Our Board, executive management team and I are completely committed to making that happen. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jared Smith, Amo's new Chief Executive Officer. He will discuss our first quarter in more detail, review the current state of operations and what we believe the future has in store for AMMO, its team and its shareholders.\nJared Smith: Thank you, Fred, and good afternoon, everyone. This is my first earnings call as CEO, and I couldn't be more excited to be here. The last 6 months, we've been rolling up our sleeves and making tremendous strides in creating real operational lift inside and outside the 4 walls. As I laid out in my letter to shareholders on July 31, we are driving the business through 3 major categories. First category, we're expanding Gunnbroker.com's platform and reach through centralized payment processing, carding and the addition of services to complement the products relevant to our community. The second category is we're focusing the ammunition division on enhancing margins through expansion of our rifle brass lines, continuous improvement measures and vertical integration and to project oil manufacturing. And finally, and most importantly, we're aligning the goals, compensation and incentives of the management team with shareholder interest. Our work and our strategic directions are starting to pay off as we have already begun to see the positive effects here in the first quarter. Our gross margins were 40.9% compared to 27.3% in the prior quarter with an adjusted EBITDA of $6.6 million, up from $3.8 million in Q4. Cash generated from operations was $13 million, up from $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. As we transition the business away from low-margin commodity ammunition sales to higher-margin OEM brass sales, we gave up top line revenue and focused on bottom line profitability. This was reflected in our sales for the quarter being down $34.3 million from $43.7 million in the prior quarter due to this transition in the business and overall market conditions. We had a total increase in cash of $8.4 million and repurchased 739,000 shares this last quarter through our buyback program. We will continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet through capital allocation with strategic buybacks and a credit of purchases as we see opportunity in the quarters ahead. I'd now like to speak specifically on gunbroker.com. We moved $238.8 million in product on the platform this quarter, down from $281.2 million in the prior quarter. This follows industry seasonality was only slightly lower than our internal projections for Gunbroker.com. While revenues decreased, our margins remained strong, 87% compared to 85.5% in the prior quarter. We also expect a lift on the platform starting in Q3, Q4 as we roll out our centralized payment processing and multi-item carton. As we start the multi-item card, we will be able to increase accessory sales and over time, increase our final value fee across the higher-margin products and services. We believe high single digits are achievable compared to the 5% to 6% we currently earn today. We are rolling out beta testing the payment processing and will continue to onboard new sellers through Q4. Our Cart capabilities are in development, and we anticipate that platform coming online by the end of our fiscal year. Now I'd like to transition to the Ammunition division. The Ammunition division of AMMO in created positive margins for the first time since June of 2022. We reported $20.3 million in revenue with a 9.5% gross margin, up from negative 8.6% in the previous quarter. While this is a major win, we anticipate strong headwinds for loaded ammunition sales for the next 2 quarters. We continue to refocus the ammunition company on the most profitable segments of the market, and we'll continue to monitor our margins during this very tough economic time. The OEM market for casings, brass casings, the revenue increased to $6.2 million, up from $3.5 million in the previous quarter. This is a great result considering that we started this transition in January. I'd like to thank everybody for joining the call today, and I look forward to continued and robust communication with you as the year progresses. At this time, I would now like to turn it over to Rob Wiley to walk us through the financials.\nRob Wiley: Thank you, Jared. Welcome, everyone. Let me now review the financials of the first quarter of our 2024 fiscal year in more detail. Margins on our Marketplace segment remained strong, and our gross margins have increased on our ammunition segment as we begin to see the benefits of the transition to our leaner operating model with a higher focus on undress sales. We remain confident with the progress we have made to date, but still face headwinds as we continue to see softening in the U.S. commercial ammunition markets. We have, however, continued to increase our cash position with $13 million in cash from operations generated in the quarter. We ended the first quarter with total revenues of approximately $34.3 million in comparison to $60.8 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in revenue was primarily related to the decrease in sales activity from our ammunition segment as the U.S. commercial ammunition markets continue to soften. Our casing sales, however, which afford us higher gross margins increased to $6.2 million, up from $3.3 million in the prior year period. Our Marketplace revenue was $13.9 million for the reporting quarter. Cost of goods sold was approximately $20.2 million for the quarter compared to $42.6 million in the comparable prior year quarter. The decrease in cost of goods sold was related to the decrease in sales volume, but was also related to higher gross margins from our 2 segments. Our gross margin for the quarter was $14 million or 40.9% compared to $18.1 million or 29.8% in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit margin is related to the shift in our sales mix. There are approximately $2.8 million of nonrecurring legal expenses incurred in our first fiscal quarter, which we have included as an add back to adjusted EBITDA. Without the nonrecurring legal expenses, we would have generated a profit for the quarter. For the quarter, we recorded adjusted EBITDA of approximately $6.6 million compared to the prior year quarter adjusted EBITDA of $10.6 million. This resulted in a net loss per share of $0.02 or an adjusted net income per share of $0.05 compared to the prior year period of net income of $0.02 per share or adjusted net income per share of $0.07. We continue to push forward on the improvements to our marketplace, gunbroker.com. We are currently in the process of rolling out beta testing for our payment platform with former launch expected to begin by the end of this quarter. Our car platform for the gunbroker.com marketplace is on pace and is expected to launch by the end of this fiscal year. We feel confident in our financial position as we have reported $130.6 million in current assets, including $47.5 million of cash and cash equivalents in comparison to $23.9 million in current liabilities. We repurchased approximately 739,000 shares of common stock under our repurchase plan in the reported quarter, bringing us to over 1 million shares repurchased in total under the plan. We continue to look for opportunities to bolster our impressive balance sheet. That concludes our opening remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Koranda with Eros [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst: Mike Zebra on for Matt. Maybe just start on the casing side of the business. I guess just what percentage of Cassons production are we currently selling to OEMs -- at some point in the past, you talked about it being 10% to 15%, but obviously, a different business nowadays. So just where do we stand there? And where does that need to go over time as we continue to scale the casingside of the business.\nJared Smith: This is Jared. It's is. I see our business taking a turn for the positive over the next 2 quarters. And the casings business is easily going to be 25% to 35% of our business going forward. It is a growing business. There's demand out there. There's strong margins to be captured there, certainly in this very, very tough economic time as ammunition sales continued to decline and margin compresses across the board for the rest of the nonvertically-integrated players.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And given that loaded MO demand is still relatively soft across the entire industry, how should we think about pricing for Shell cases? Are we having to compete on price here at OEMs? Or is press relatively stable for Ken?\nJared Smith: Prices -- we reentered into this market in a declining market. So I would say right now and for the foreseeable future, price is very stable. Our capacities are increasing more capacity comes online with a new factory that we brought online back in August every day. And I see this -- I mean, this is a huge win for us, and I see this continuing. And I do not see any further price erosion related to the market on the casing demand.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Makes sense. Maybe switching to the loaded AMMO side. Good to see loaded AMMO margins kind of sequentially improved pretty meaningfully. I just wondering, do we have any remaining bulk-loaded AMMO inventory to clear through? Or are we kind of done on that end?\nJared Smith: For the most part, we're done, we will always have to manufacture some amount of range AMMO [ph] to be relevant in this market, but it will play a much, much smaller role going forward than it has in the past in terms of clearing out our inventory, I think our inventory is healthy. There are still some items, slow-moving inventory that sits there, but it's not a major factor. It's not a going concern for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Got it. That makes sense. Last one for me. Aside from any unforeseen discounting, if the demand environment gets worse, how should we think about the progression and timing of getting loaded AMMO gross margins back to the 20% range? Do you think we can get there by year-end? Just how are we thinking about how that maybe just scales over time?\nJared Smith: Yes. I think for our business, margins improve. We have more rifle grass capacity coming on in the 2 quarters ahead. That’s clearly where we can make margin. We can defer kind of the the non-vertically integrated piece of our production over a larger dollar value and margins increase. And once again, it really – our focus is rifle ammunition and playing a much, much larger role in that rifle space, both domestically and internationally. Thank you, sir.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Smith with Lake Street.\nMark Smith: First question for me, kind of broadly within Amo. Jared, can you give us any updates just as you talked about continued headwinds coming here. Maybe talk about kind of high demand calibers, 9-millimeter, 223556, kind of what you're seeing there? And then any changes that you're seeing in demand that we're pricing or kind of channel inventory in kind of everything else, primarily centerfire rifle.\nJared Smith: Yes. So I think what's happened, Mark, is that a lot of the ammunition manufacturers have been holding on to inventory waiting for little shifts in the market for things to pop. I see 9-millimeter and 223. I really don't see any further price erosion out there from what's currently on the shelf. There will be some specials coming out for Black Friday. But I think for all intents and purposes, the market is fairly stable and we bottomed out and we will stay at this for the next 2 quarters. Going forward, there are still fantastic pockets that we can play in, in revolver, there's still inventory out there that is lower than pre-pandemic inventory levels in those areas, and that's where we plan to play.\nMark Smith: Okay. And then maybe talk as much as you can or might be tough competitively, but walk us through kind of the margin on brass patent sales versus on loaded am.\nJared Smith: Yes. I mean, today, our cost to produce ball O is somewhere between $2.20 to $2.40 per 1,000 and the price at retail was $2.05. We just can't play there. Whereas I can sell a brass case, and I can still make 10% margins. So I sell bras casings anywhere between $75,000 up to $85,000 and there's space and there's demand there. And we can help out the international market. We can help out our domestic players, and we can help out new brands they're wanting to enter this space. So the rifle ammunition, if we looked at like 223, 223 at retail right now is going anywhere between 3.75% and 4.25% for Balama. We were just -- the primer is too much of a factor of our cost for us to play in volume against larger vertically integrated players, but we can sell the brass casing for a 20% to 35% margin. It's where we're going to stay and it's where we're going to play until this market returns, and we're going into an election year next year. So we're quite excited, and there's not a lack of international demand out there for [indiscernible] as rifle cases.\nMark Smith: Okay. Yes. And then as we think broadly about you guys get it back more heavily into bras casing sales to OEMs, can you talk at all about maybe how much of this is on contract versus just kind of open to buy orders from OEMs?\nJared Smith: Great question, Mark. Yes. We are signing large contracts today. I would say our contractual sales are now making up somewhere between 15% to 25% of our total capacity of that plant. All new contracts within the last 6 months.\nMark Smith: Okay. And then I think the last one for me, broadly speak to -- I know it's a seasonally weaker quarter here for gun broker and this kind of demand for some of these products. But talk about where you guys see the consumer primarily specific to gun broker, where is this consumer what's it going to take to kind of maybe spur some more buying activity from these consumers? So maybe your outlook as we move into more important hunting and holiday season. \nJared Smith: Great question, first of all. gun broker is a perfect reflection of the market. And what we're seeing for new guns is that new guns are in the retail locations, and they're not having to go to gun broker define that ubiquitous Block 17 or the Remington 870. What they are going to go and broker for are those unique items, and we're actually seeing that our marginality improve on the platform because we're doing, a, sells a higher mix of cells of used guns. But what's really going to drive gunbroker users back to the Gunbroker platform is streamlining the checkout process, internalizing and providing credit card services and it's the cart item, and it's really just the ease of use of that platform that we'll be delivering in Q3 or Q4 of this year \nMark Smith: Excellent.\nJared Smith: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, and I will turn the call over to Jared Smith for in closing comments.\nJared Smith: I just want to say thank you for everybody for tuning in today. We are extremely bullish about the future. We're heading into the fall season. We've had this factory now for a year there in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Things are really starting to click for us as brass cells are taking on. From the gun broker side, the developments that we're doing on the platform are exciting. You're going to be hearing more from us in the future. And stay tuned, and thank you for joining the call today.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all disconnect."
