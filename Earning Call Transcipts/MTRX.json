I'll now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Hewitt: Thank you, Kellie, and good morning, everyone. When we think about the safety risks present in the construction industry, we often think about the physical risks to people, but there are equally significant risks that have to do with mental health and well-being. Mental health issues arise to a variety of reasons, loneliness, high pressure work environments, seasonal layoffs, lots of a family member or friend, and can manifest in different ways, including loneliness, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and substance abuse. The construction industry has one of the highest suicide rates of any industry when compared to all other construction fatalities suicide occurs five times more often. This is why the construction industry is taking a collaborative approach to better understand mental health issues by providing research-based solutions. Through our participation in the Construction Industry Institute, and Construction Safety Research Alliance. Matrix is directly involved in this effort. Matrix is also committed to doing all we can across our job sites and office locations, and we're doing so through a cross functional internal initiative Matrix Cares. We believe that together, we can make a difference for our own employees, and others across our industry. And I believe the mental and physical safety of our employees as well as those visiting our offices or job sites is the most important thing we can do as coworkers and leaders. Now letâ€™s talk about business. I am proud to announce that with awards of $233 million in a quarter, we've achieved a record backlog for Matrix of $1.45 billion. This is an all-time high for the company in its 40-year history and is an achievement that is the result of the hard work of our people and our focused strategic approach in our core markets. We have transformed our organization to be more cost efficient by ensuring our skills, expertise, and strong brand are aligned with our core markets. We are positioned to safely execute projects with improved operating processes, while continuing to deliver best in class quality for our customers. As you will see, when Kevin walks through our results, Matrix has resolved the primary issues that have plagued us the last few years. We have completed projects that were bid into highly competitive pandemic environment, which resulted in limited margin opportunity. We also streamlined and refocused the company, restored our direct gross margins to our historical double-digit range, rebuild our backlog to historic levels to support higher revenue volumes in the coming quarters, and improved our liquidity position and reduced our debt to 0. A dramatic improvement in both the volume and quality of the projects in our backlog, we expect revenue volume to grow and as such, leverage our streamlined cost structure, which will resolve our final issue. Now I want to spend a few minutes on our work in the energy markets. Recently, President Biden paused pending and future permits to export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries. Generally, we do not expect this pause to impact our opportunity pipeline or backlog. A small to mid-scale LNG facilities we have won and are pursuing are domestic in nature, riding backup fuel supply, heat shaving, or ship bunkering. Any LNG tank projects that are related to large scale export facilities that might be associated with the current White House permit position, are more of an opportunistic pursuit for Matrix. We have significant opportunities in the small-to-mid scale LNG market I just described as well as NGLs, ammonia, and hydrogen and expect these opportunities to continue contributing to backlog. While the transition to a low carbon energy mix has been a focus on global energy policy, the world is still heavily dependent on fossil fuel, and will be for the foreseeable future. At the same time, energy companies are actively at work developing longer term, more sustainable energy solutions. For Matrix, our expertise in both the traditional and emerging energy markets, together with our longstanding reputation for safe, quality delivery, positions us as a leading contractor across the entire industry and puts us in to the advantageous position. Our opportunity pipeline remains steady at $5 billion, demonstrating the strength of our markets and our ability to continue our long-term trend of backlog growth. We remain a contractor of choice for work in traditional oil and gas, including the engineering and construction of crude storage tanks and terminals, ongoing maintenance repair work, refinery turnarounds, retrofitting for renewable fuels, and the installation of natural gas processing infrastructure. With increasing use of LNG as a low carbon solution for ensuring reliable and affordable power for electricity, heating and cooling, and also an alternative fuel for high horsepower applications. Matrix has emerged as a leader in the design, construction, maintenance, and repair of LNG storage tanks and balance of plant facilities. Major energy companies also rely on us for NGL storage tanks, terminals, such as ethane, ethylene propane, and butane that feed the global marketplace because of our country's vast, safe, and dependable natural gas availability. Looking forward, the transition to sustainable energy is a broad initiative and will include, among others, hydrogen. This is a market that while not presently a significant revenue driver for us will be as we assume a major leadership role and fulfilling the significant infrastructure needs that will evolve. This has creation of our strong market position in LNG was made possible because of our specialty vessel, cryogenic capabilities. The hydrogen market requires these same specialized skill sets. In the not market that will develop overnight, nor is the one that that any contractor can simply step into once it's developed. Same is true for ammonia, methanol, as energy carriers and a means of transporting hydrogen. Drawing on our extensive cryogenic engineering and construction expertise, Matrix is already at work laying the foundation needed to ensure we were at the forefront in providing the needed solutions in this space. For example, we have completed construction of a hydrogen sphere in the southwestern U.S. and are beginning the engineering for a liquid hydrogen storage sphere for a client on the West Coast, which we will also construct. We're also actively at work on a FEED study for a hydrogen production, and distribution facility and working on a feasibility study for a global energy company to develop large scale liquid hydrogen storage solutions. With an increasing number of hydrogen and ammonia opportunities internationally, we are building strategic relationship with construction organizations, like that recently announced with Tissot Industries and other European partners, which provide the ability to offer complete EPC solutions Across the European Union, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland and elsewhere. As shared last quarter, we had communication with several of our long-standing clients, who are also part of the hydrogen hub teams identified to receive funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Of course, we continue to be active in our other end markets with robust opportunities and growth potential across each of our reporting segments. As I've said before, our organization has been meaningfully transformed over the past few years, and that transformation is showing up on our performance. We continue to fine tune the organization and are investing in the technology, systems and personnel needed to execute our strategy and grow the business. I'll hand the call over to Kevin to review the results.\nKevin Cavanah: Thank you, John. The overall results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations While revenue was a bit lower than expected, direct margin performance, cost management, bottom line performance, backlog, and liquidity were all at or above our expectations. We generated awards of $231 million resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.3, our 10th consecutive quarter at or above 1.0. With these awards, we have increased our backlog to $1.45 billion, the highest in company history. Backlog has increased 95% in the last year and 33% in the first half of fiscal 2024. Revenue of $175 million in the second quarter was on the lower side of our range of expectations. The decline compared to first quarter revenue of $198 million related primarily to the normal timing of project execution on storage construction projects with the first quarter benefiting from a high level of project procurement. As I mentioned last quarter, our backlog contains larger long term construction projects. There is an inherent lag between the time when a project is awarded and when it begins to have a material impact on revenue. In some cases, this lag can be between 3 and 6 months or longer. The contribution to revenue from these projects has been minimal thus far as each move through scope finalization, engineering and planning stages at its own pace. We expect revenue from these projects to increase modestly in the third quarter and then pick up meaningful in the fourth quarter and the remain at elevated levels throughout fiscal 2025 and 2026. In the meantime, we are encouraged that direct gross margins return to historical double-digit levels in the first half of 2024. Project execution was strong once again, but was offset by under recovered construction overhead resulting from the low revenue volume that impacted gross margins by almost 500 basis points. The result was a gross margin of 6%, which was consistent with the first quarter. We expect to see improved overhead recovery in the third quarter and to achieve full recovery in the fourth quarter as a result of the revenue ramp we previously discussed. Organizational efficiencies achieved over the last several years continue to benefit our cost structure. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $15.7 million in the second quarter, which is the lowest level since the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This compares to $17.1 million in the first quarter. The decrease in second quarter was primarily attributable to a reduction in expense associated with the variable accounting for cash settled stock compensation and lower project pursuit cost. The company will continue to control costs in order to leverage SG&A but expects to see modest targeted increases to support revenue growth as the year progresses. Other income during the second quarter included a gain of $2 million on a $2.7 million sale of a facility in Catoosa, Oklahoma. The facility was previously utilized for our industrial cleaning business, which was sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This completes the divestiture and closure of non-core service offerings as part of our strategy to focus the business on our core markets. As expected, the effective tax rate was near 0 for the second quarter, and we expect the effective tax rate to be around 0 throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we had a net loss of $2.9 million or $0.10 per fully diluted share, which was similar to the net loss $3.2 million or $0.12 per share in the first quarter. Moving to the operating segments. In the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment, revenue was $62 million in the second quarter, as compared to $90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. First quarter revenues for this segment were positively impacted by the procurement of materials and components for construction projects awarded in the prior fiscal year. We did not have a similar level of procurement in the second quarter. We expect higher revenue volume as we move through the remainder of fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025 as large specialty storage project awards transitioned through contracting, project planning, and mobilization, and into field construction. Gross margin was 2.9% in the second quarter as strong project was execution was negatively impacted by 770 basis points from the under recovery of construction overhead costs due to the lower revenue. We have allocated additional resources to this segment to support recent awards, a significant opportunity proposal pipeline and the related additional revenue that we expect in the coming quarters. With revenue increases in this segment, we expect to reach full recovery of construction overhead costs in the fourth in the first quarter. In the utility and power infrastructure segment $40 million in the second quarter compared to $32 million in the first quarter as revenue begins to benefit from peak shaver projects previously awarded. We expect LNG peak shaving revenue to continue to increase as we move through the second half of fiscal 2024. Gross margin was 3.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as good project execution in this segment was offset by almost 600 basis points from under recovery of construction overhead costs. We've allocated additional resources to this segment as well, to support recent awards, a strong bidding environment, and related anticipated revenue growth. As revenue continues to increase in this segment, we expect to reach full recovery of overhead costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. And finally, in the Process and Industrial Facility segment, second quarter revenue was $71 million, which was slightly lower than the $75 million in the first quarter. We expect revenue to remain at similar level as we move through the remainder of fiscal 2024 and then increase in fiscal 2025 related to previously awarded construction work. The segment gross margin was 9.4% in the second quarter compared to 6.8% in the first quarter. With project execution strong in both quarters, we also reduced construction overhead costs in the second quarter by allocating resources to other segments, as I noted previously. Now let's discuss our financial position. Liquidity increased to $106 million an improvement of $26 million in the quarter. Positive net cash inflows of $30 million from operations allowed the company to repay all outstanding borrowings on our credit facility of $10 million and increase our cash balance by $20 million. We expect to see cash and liquidity also improve in the second half of fiscal 2024. We'll continue to proactively manage the balance sheet to support the improving business and believe we have the liquidity to support our financial needs, including funding working capital for the normal spring peak and reimbursable work, funding construction projects that are in a prepaid position and targeted capital expenditures to support operations. As we move forward and continue to strengthen our balance sheet, we will evaluate our approach to capital allocation to ensure we are creating value for our shareholders. That concludes my prepared comments. So I'll now turn the call back to John.\nJohn Hewitt: Thank you, Kevin. Before we open for questions, I'd like to reiterate some key takeaways for today. First, with record high backlog, we expect to see a marked improvement in revenue volumes in the near term. Those higher revenue volumes will provide for better construction overhead absorption, leverage of SG&A, and improved bottom line performance. But it's difficult in our business to accurately predict the timing of awards, starts at backlog version of revenue, we are highly confident in this outlook. Second, we believe our strategic approach to our strong end markets, clients and services to help us maintain a sizable opportunity pipeline and lead to further backlog growth and strong performance well into the future. Third, organizationally, we are leaner and more efficient. We'll continue to invest in the process, systems and people needed to drive performance improvement and deliver strong project execution. In conclusion, there was a lot of positive momentum in the business, and we are well positioned to maximize our profitability and generate value and growth for our stakeholders. I'd like to open the call for questions, and then come back to you for some closing thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Franzreb of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nJohn Franzreb: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the questions. I like to start with the gross margin profile in the second quarter. Considering how much revenue was down and when you look at it versus a year ago, was sizably better. How much reflects the absence of unprofitable jobs and how much reflects new jobs priced appropriately in that mix. Can you give us a sense of what drove the margin in the quarter?\nKevin Cavanah: So as I as I talked about on the call, the direct gross margins in the quarter, were strong back in the double digit area that we've been striving to get to. That's the result of the quality of bookings that we've had over the last year, year and a half. If you look at the same period last year, the direct margins were extremely low - low single digits. And that was because of the combination. We were still working off the COVID backlog. We were still continuing to work on a project that was, very difficult for us to complete in a profitable manner. So when you look at the margin performance quarter-over-quarter It's an extremely big improvement. I don't have to split between what's related to new projects versus the old, but it's sufficed to say the margin performance, is that where we need it to be on these projects. Now what's left is to get the revenue volume up to where we want it. So we can fully recover our construction overhead.\nJohn Franzreb: And Kevin, just for clarity sake, what's your definition of direct gross margins?\nKevin Cavanah: So I think about direct gross margins, it's the actual margin that I'm earning on each individual job and when I think about gross margin, it's the combination of those direct margins on jobs, combined with the recovery of our construction overhead pool of costs that we utilize to manage all those projects. So when we get to a period where we've got the right volume, we're fully recovering those overheads and Therefore, the direct gross margins is fairly equal to the gross margin. In a period where our revenue volume is low, and we're not fully recovering that under recovery can have a very significant impact on our margins as it as it did this quarter, almost 600 basis points. So that's something that's extremely important for us to manage, and it's the it's the one item that John noted in his comments that that we've still gotta, finish getting that completed. We completed everything else. We've just gotta get that strong backlog we've booked the last year plus to convert to revenue, which we think is coming.\nJohn Franzreb: And, John, regarding the awards cycle, what innings do you think you're in? Is it unreasonable to assume that you can persist at the current rate of awards?\nJohn Hewitt: No. I don't think that's unreasonable. I mean, you know, the again timing â€“ timing is everything. And, whether quarter after quarter, it's gonna be above 1 or not, but certainly think we're in a position to exit the year with a one plus on awards and our book to bill and projects that are in our pipeline, you know, a variety of sizes. So we think we'll continue to contribute to backlog well out in the future. So we think we're in early innings in our ability to continue to and add good projects to backlog and continue to build and grow the business.\nJohn Franzreb: Okay. Got it. That sounds great. And one last question. If I heard correctly in the prepared remarks, it sounded like that the revenue outlook is strong through fiscal 2026 based on the current bookings profile that doesn't assume any incremental new awards. Is that the proper understanding?\nKevin Cavanah: Well, so we're we always have a portion of our revenue that's what we call book and burn that that will get awarded and we'll burn it off in the next quarter or two and then we have the larger projects that are - have a have a two and a half, three-year, construction period. So, when we make comments like that, with these larger projects we've added to backlog, we've got much better visibility into the total revenue stream for 2025 and 2026 that gives us the confidence to make that statement.\nJohn Hewitt: If I add on to that, John, I would say the backlog in place now helps us lay a foundation for the future. And then overlay what we see in the opportunity pipeline, gives us confidence that we're gonna be able to have a strong revenue stream here out over the next couple of years.\nJohn Franzreb: Great. That's great, John. I appreciate it. I'll get back into queue and let somebody else go. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nBrent Thielman: Hi. This is Jean Ramirez for Brent Thielman D.A. Davidson. I'll start with the revenue question. Should we see some revenue progression from fiscal quarter - from the second fiscal quarter to third? It seems like this should be sort of a trough for revenue given the sizable backlog today.\nKevin Cavanah: Yeah. We would agree with that. I think this will be a the low point of the fiscal year. You'll see some decent growth here in the third quarter and then should be higher growth in the fourth.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thank you. Just interviews on the refinery turnaround season and activities you performed there. Just wanted to see if it's a better or worse, relative to the past few years.\nKevin Cavanah: I mean, we're entering our refinery turnaround cycle. Basically, now we're sort of in it. Majority of our refinery turnaround work is located in the Pacific Northwest. And, I don't know if there was anything unusual this year versus last year, I would say I'd probably point it as sort of an average turnaround cycle for us in the facilities that we work.\nBrent Thielman: Thank you. And one more question. So you mentioned some favorable direct margins. Are those continuing to get better with New York - with the work awarded in New York, or I guess in other words, do the bid margins keep moving higher because the market's so busy right now?\nJohn Hewitt: I think what I would the way I would look at it is When we look at the margin performance in the first half of fiscal 2024, we've had some good project closeouts. On completing some projects that have moved that margin up. I'm really overall strong execution by our field that has helped that. I think that'll be replaced by the quality backlog that we've got. Those projects should lend themselves to a similar level of margin. So I wouldn't expect - we'll continue to strive to - maximize the direct margin performance but I wouldn't expect, direct margins to go significantly higher than our the 10% to 12% range that we've talked about being the normal range for the business. And you also need to remember that 30%, 40% of our business is reimbursable and a lot of maintenance activities, that type of work, really good work for us. But it leads itself to a lower margin profile. So instead of double-digit margin for we're in the high single digits for that type of work.\nBrent Thielman: Perfect. I appreciate the color. I'll hop back in and let someone else ask some questions.\nOperator: Looks like we have a question from John Franzreb of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nJohn Franzreb: Thank you. John, just back to the hydrogen discussion, I might have missed this. You said it was small, but put it in context how much business you do in the hydrogen market. What do you think maybe the potential is and the timeline for realizing that kind of a potential?\nJohn Hewitt: So I think, you know, obviously, it's about, you know, how fast the at least the U.S. transitions to a higher percentage of hydrogen in the energy mix. I think we feel pretty comfortable long term that hydrogen will take a larger position in the U.S. energy mix. Whether that's for, certainly in industrial processes, but, for, as a, a fuel for transportation fuel, and then for, some kind of a mix or blending for power generation. So I think what you're seeing, what we're seeing right now is a lot of, kind of foundation for us, laying the foundation for that future, were a lot of time spent on marketing, time spent on providing feasibility and FEED studies to various clients to help them with their decision making profile on what their next steps are, picking up an occasional, storage sphere or an occasional, maybe smaller, hydrogen processing facility. So I think it's gonna continue to grow for us. So but I think, you know, we're probably a couple of years away from a hydrogen, from a material impact on our backlog and revenues from hydrogen. That said, you know, I would expect here over the next 12 to 18 months, and we'll continue to add small hydrogen related projects into our backlog and that should continue to grow over the subsequent years.\nJohn Franzreb: Understood. And just a little bit about the leverage discussion. Kevin, you suggested that the second quarter SG&A was artificially low, due to timing of, I guess, bonus accruals and other items. But you also said that you expect to leverage the SG&A line rather significantly in the year ahead. So how should we think about SG&A, on a go forward basis, similar to maybe the first quarter? marginal increase. Just any color on that line would be helpful?\nKevin Cavanah: I think the second half SG&A will probably be higher than the first half was. The variable accounting on cash settled stock based compensation. We'll have a higher expense. We also anticipate increased, project pursuit cost as we continue to work to build the backlog and then you know, than just some other targeted increases that we'll need just for the added revenue volume that comes. The way I think about SG&A is we've got a target out there we're trying to get the SG&A to 6.5%. I think we'll make a significant move toward that especially in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure we'll get all the way there, but we can definitely get, a much closer. Hopefully, we get to 7% or lower. And then then I think that's achievable mark in fiscal 2025.\nJohn Franzreb: And when you talked about asset relocations, just about moving guys from, personnel from process into utility in stores, not adding, additional personnel. Am I understanding that properly?\nKevin Cavanah: Yes. For the there's really two aspects of the construction overhead. So first of all, when we talk about reallocating resources, we've talked about the fact that our staffs can work in multiple segments and if you look at the volume of revenue that was flowing through the process and industrial facility segment last year, it was definitely a higher percentage. That we completed some of that work, and I mentioned that we're kind of in a low period here before additional work kicks in. So those resources are being allocated toward the other two segments. And when we try to put a little more color on those resources, what those are, that's all the project management, the quality, the safety, all that infrastructure we have in place to execute the projects will be more focused on those other two segments, in the second half of the year than they were in, say, the prior year.\nJohn Franzreb: Okay. And just lastly, on the long-term financial targets, any kind of update when we would expect to realize those targets, is that a exit philosophy ending this 2025? Or what are your thoughts there?\nKevin Cavanah: I think, again, it's similar probably to the answer on, SG&A. I think you can see significant movement, toward those targets at the end of the in the fourth quarter. Will we get there all the way? I'm not sure about that, but I do think those are achievable in in the in fiscal 2025.\nJohn Franzreb: Great, guys. Thank you for taking my follow ups.\nOperator: It looks like we have follow-up questions from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nBrent Thielman: Hi. Just thinking about CapEx Can you give us a sense of how we should be modeling, CapEx for the year or the next couple of years? Just, should we think of the is it tied to revenue growth pursuing there are some costs to support all of this growth, right?\nKevin Cavanah: It is tied to revenue growth, and it's also tied to the fact that as we've been trying to control costs the last few years, we've held our capital spending pretty low. So I'd expect it to increase. We've put a long-term target out there at 1.5% of revenue. I think we'd probably be around that level for the second half of the year or potentially a little higher as we as we kind of almost you ramp up some of that CapEx for the for the revenue volumes that are coming. I donâ€™t have a fiscal 2025 CapEx budget at this point, but I would expect we'd probably be at least at the 1.5% next year or potentially a little higher.\nBrent Thielman: And, for fiscal year 2025, when you say a little higher, is that compared to the second half of the, fiscal year 2024 or just in general, a little higher than 1%?\nKevin Cavanah: I'm talking I'm talking a little higher as a percent of revenue. So when I talk about the 1.5% of revenue, it could be it could be 1.8 or 2%. But, again, I don't have a I don't have a developed CapEx forecast yet. I'm just anticipating that there will be needs for portions of the business that are growing.\nBrent Thielman: Perfect. Makes sense. I appreciate the follow-up. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Hewitt for any closing remarks.\nJohn Hewitt: I wanna thank everybody for being on the call today. I hope it's clear that there are a lot of great things happening in in the business. And that, we are positioned for significantly improved bottom line profitability as you look out into the out into the short term here. So you very much for your time today and everybody. Please be safe. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to today's host Ms. Kellie Smythe, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Matrix Service Company.\nKellie Smythe: Thank you, Josh. Good morning, and welcome to Matrix Service Company's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call.  Participants on today's call will include John Hewitt, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Cavanah, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The presentation materials we will be referring to during the webcast today can be found under Events and Presentations on the Investor Relations section of matrixservicecompany.com.  Before we begin, please let me remind you that on today's call, we may make various remarks about future expectations, plans and prospects for Matrix Service Company that constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may different materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements because of various factors, including those discussed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent filings made by the company with the SEC. To the extent we utilize non-GAAP measures, reconciliations will be provided in various press releases, periodic SEC filings and on our website.  Before I turn the call over to John Hewitt, I'd like to share information about several upcoming investor conferences and corporate access opportunity. On November 14, we will hold the Matrix Service Company Virtual Annual Stockholder Meeting. You can register to attend as instructed in the proxy or via the Events tab on our Investor Relations website. We will present at and hold one-on-one meetings at the Sidoti Micro-Cap Virtual Conference planned for November 15 and 16.

If you'd like additional information on any of these events, I invite you to contact us with Matrix Service Company Investor Relations website.  I will now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Hewitt: Thank you, Kellie, and good morning, everyone. Here at Matrix, we continue to pursue and expect zero injuries across our platform. Broadly, our focus is around accountability, communication and training to drive better outcomes. Each of us need to be accountable to ourselves and each other as we think about our behaviors, decision-making and risk awareness and not only our professional lives, but at home as well. We need to communicate our expectations, why safety is important and support each other.  As a learning organization, training is critical to improve awareness, decision-making and ultimately, outcomes. Above all, each employee has the authority and the obligation to stop work when they see or feel uncomfortable with the task they or a coworker are about to perform. Three simple questions: What am I about to do? How can I get hurt? What am I going to do about it? Are key to keeping yourself and your coworkers safe.  Turning to the quarter. We're pleased to update you on the continued momentum in our business and our end markets. We generated awards of $497 million in our fiscal first quarter, surpassing our fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 awards of $464 million. This is our highest project award total in 5 years. Project awards resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 2.5.  Our Storage and Terminal Solutions segment was the standout in the quarter, recording a book-to-bill of 4.6 on the back of a large capital project award. This award is a midsized LNG liquefaction and storage facility in the Eastern U.S., similar to previous small to mid-sized LNG projects completed in the past. This is a project for a client, we've done a good deal of work for over the years, which is a testament to our ability to deliver complex projects safely, on time and with high quality.  In our last earnings call, we referenced another LNG project we were awarded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, an LNG peak shaver in our Utility and Power Infrastructure segment. Together, these projects are in line with our strategy of leveraging our strong cryogenic storage brand and our capabilities in engineering, fabrication, procurement and construction. Our strategy to offer complete solutions to the growing small to midsized LNG facility market is creating awards and growth for the company as we expand our brand and capture market share. This market covers a range of uses, such as peak shaving units, backup power plant fuel supply, ship bunkering, rocket fueling and export facilities.  Our teams have a great reputation executing these types of projects and have built strong client relationships over the years, made clear by continued awards like the most recent one, I mentioned above. The pipeline for opportunities in the small to mid-scale LNG market remains strong with both new and repeat clients. Matrix' capability to wrap the complete facility around the storage is unique in our markets and among our competition.  Considering our current position in a robust market and with the numerous project proposals and bids in progress as well as the ongoing FEED studies, we expect to keep adding similar projects to our backlog over time. Adjacent to this strong position in the small, the midsized LNG market our strategy extends to other specialty vessels and facilities for ammonia, ethane and other natural gas liquids.  In addition, our brand and skill sets extend the hydrogen storage facilities as well as development of large-scale storage solutions for various clients. We have several clients that are part of the 7 hydrogen hub teams recently selected by the Department of Energy to receive funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We are in discussion with these clients on how we can assist them in these programs. We believe there will be significant opportunities for our company in not only these hubs, but also a variety of other projects that are taking advantage of the changing energy mix and federal clean energy funding and tax credits.  As we look out into the future, we fully expect our backlog and specialty vessel storage and related facilities to continue to grow with a diversified mix of energy projects. In addition to our storage market strategy, the vision for the rest of the business creates opportunity for growth, expansion and sustainability in revenue. For example, our position for electrical infrastructure services from substations to transmission and distribution and other industrial electrical work, presents a strong growth potential for the company in a market that has significant demand of expansion, upgrades and repair across the country.  We are working with technology providers on an increasing number of project opportunities across the country for carbon capture. We continue to be a leading contractor in traditional energy for refinery maintenance and repair, turnarounds and projects, many of which are focused on lower carbon process improvements such as renewable fuel refining. We remain active in crude and refined product storage tanks and terminals, both new build and repair and maintenance. And finally, midstream gas compression, mining and minerals, chemical and petrochemical and aerospace projects on an E-only, C-only or full EPC basis, leverage our engineering capabilities, project skills and construction experience. These service lines, operatings and skill sets, complement each other and support the growth aspirations of the entire business, market capture and geographic diversity of our operations. All these end markets continue to be supported by the strong tailwinds and macroeconomic drivers we have discussed before, which include global energy security, domestic energy supply assurance, clean energy transition goals, commodity demand to support renewables and infrastructure upgrades and industrial reshoring of manufacturing as well as federal infrastructure investments that will start to meaningfully flow into the project phase during calendar year 2024.  I can confidently say that we're executing our strategy from a position of strength. Our backlog has grown by 27% from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and 126% from a year ago. At $1.4 billion, our backlog is at its highest level since June 30, 2015. Even with $1.6 billion of awards these past 4 quarters, our opportunity pipeline remains steady between $5 billion to $6 billion, providing a strong indication of the potential in our markets and ability to continue our long-term trend of backlog growth.  Organization has been meaningfully transformed over the past few years. We are focused on the end markets that present the best opportunity for us to leverage our decades of experience. We have restructured our organization to be more cost efficient, while maintaining our skills, expertise and strong brand. We are positioned to safely execute projects with improved operating processes while continuing to deliver best-in-class quality for our customers, and we continue to invest in digital solutions to improve our administrative and project execution performance.  While the company is well positioned with a high-quality backlog that contains larger long-term capital projects. It is important to note that our traditional small cap projects and recurring repair and maintenance work, which is strategic to our overall portfolio come in and out of backlog in a shorter time frame. And this work has historically represented on average over 50% of our annual revenue.  So to be clear, our strategic market focus and positioning, the macroeconomic and industrial drivers, and the steady opportunity pipeline, combined with our transformed organization, we'll continue to build on our diversified backlog portfolio, which will lay the foundation for the business to grow and be sustainable well into the future.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Kevin to review the results. \nKevin Cavanah: Thanks, John. Overall, the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was in line with our expectations, highlighted by the strong project awards, John previously discussed. Revenue of $198 million during the first quarter was lower than the $206 million in the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, primarily related to the decrease in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment, which I will discuss shortly, as well as seasonality in our business.  The contribution to revenue of newly awarded projects is beginning to benefit the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment but is still currently limited as the projects progress through engineering and planning stages. Gross margin was 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to a gross margin of 7.1% and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Despite generally strong project execution, gross margins in the first quarter experienced a 470 basis point impact from the under recovery of construction overhead cost. Some of these construction overhead resources have been more actively involved in the pursuit and planning of future work.  With the improved backlog, more resources will now shift to the execution of projects. On a consolidated basis, we expect to achieve full recovery of construction overhead costs on higher revenue volumes in the second half of fiscal 2024. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $17.1 million in the first quarter compared to $17 million of SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The first quarter expense includes an additional accrual of $1.6 million associated with the variable accounting for cash settled stock-based compensation, which increased due to a significantly higher stock price. The improved stock price is obviously a positive, we have all been working to achieve, but it does increase expense related to certain stock-based awards that are subject to variable accounting. This increase was offset by various other lower costs as we manage our cost structure, which includes our continued streamlining of the business as well as delaying certain costs based on the timing of revenue.  Other income during the first quarter included a gain of $2.5 million on the sale of a previously utilized facility, which was no longer strategic to the future of the business. This transaction is just one of many steps we have taken as we focus the business to its core offerings, improve efficiency and manage our cost structure. As expected, the effective tax rate for the first quarter was zero and we expect the effective tax rate to be around zero throughout fiscal 2024.  So for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we had a net loss of $3.2 million or $0.12 per share compared to a net loss of $0.3 million or $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.  Now let me briefly discuss the operating segments. In the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment, revenue increased to $90 million in the first quarter as compared to $64 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue for this segment was positively impacted in the first quarter by the procurement of materials and components for capital projects awarded in the prior fiscal year. We expect revenue to significantly improve in the second half of fiscal 2024.  Gross margin of 5.5% improved over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 due to strong project execution, but was still negatively impacted by the under-recovery of construction overhead cost. We have allocated additional resources to this segment to support recent awards and additional revenue in the second half of fiscal 2024. As these revenues increase, we expect to eliminate the under-recovery of construction overhead costs in this segment.  In the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment, revenue was $32 million in the first quarter compared to $39 million in the fourth quarter due to lower volumes of power delivery work during the summer months. LNG peak shaving work added to backlog over the past year, is expected to positively impact revenue as we move through fiscal 2024.  Gross margin of 11.4% was positively impacted by strong project execution, which led to favorable project closeouts as well as LNG peak shaving projects, which have a better margin profile.  In Process and Industrial Facilities segment revenue decreased to $75 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $103 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the completion of certain gas processing work, lower refinery volumes during the summer months and the sale of a noncore business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Despite generally strong project execution, first quarter gross margin of 6.8% was negatively impacted by low revenue volumes, which led to the under-recovery of construction overhead cost.  Now let's move to the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we utilized $28 million of cash for working capital purposes. This was expected and primarily related to the timing of cash flows on projects. We ended the first quarter with total liquidity of $80 million and $10 million in debt. Our liquidity is comprised of $27 million of unrestricted cash and $53 million of borrowing availability under the credit facility. We also have $25 million of restricted cash to support the facility. We expect to see cash and liquidity increase as we move through the rest of the fiscal year. In fact, an event subsequent to the end of the first quarter also benefits our financial position.  In October, we reached a favorable resolution on a longstanding legal dispute with an iron and steel customer that resulted in the receipt of $16.8 million. The amount collected represented the full amount owed under a reimbursable contract which the company had pursued for a number of years.  Another subsequent event that warrants mentions is that, with the improving financial position of the company, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in early November. We will continue to proactively manage the balance sheet to support the improving business.  On our last call, we provided an outlook for fiscal 2024, which is substantially unchanged. Overall, the results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. We now expect revenue to be at a similar level in the second quarter and then show strong growth in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the improved backlog.  For the full year, this will create significant year-over-year revenue growth. The bottom line results will follow a similar pattern as the revenue was significantly stronger results in the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate accelerated movement toward the longer-term financial targets in the second half of the fiscal year.  This concludes my prepared remarks, so I'll turn it back to John. \nJohn Hewitt: Thanks, Kevin. Before we go to questions, I'd just like to reiterate some key takeaways for today.  First of all, our strategic approach to the energy and industrial end markets we serve is being validated given the strength of our awards and ultimately backlog. This is supported by a steady opportunity pipeline across these markets. The timing and volume of project awards, our awards will not be linear and there will be some lighter award quarters. But overall, we believe our strategic approach will lead to further backlog growth and strong performance into the future.  In the long term, the reshaping of global energy markets, energy supply security, push towards lower carbon activity and industrial reshoring, all create opportunities that we expect will drive our business for years to come. We are well positioned and structured to maximize our profitability and generate value and growth stakeholders.  With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. \nBrent Thielman : I guess first off, John, I wanted to get just your feel for look, higher cost of capital environment looks to be sustaining going forward. You're still looking work at an elevated pace, maybe your customers' reaction to that, how that might be impacting the overall kind of business or bookings pipeline? I imagine maybe the 50% of the business that smaller project work could potentially be susceptible, but love to get your sense on that. \nJohn Hewitt: Probably two comments there. One is that we do hear from some customers that they have -- that they're relooking at their portfolio of projects capital projects that they're doing based on the cost of debt. But I would say that's a pretty small percentage of our entire client base that we're kind of hearing those things from. And a lot of that may be mixed up with individual things that they've got going on within their organization of how they have spent or overspent their capital in the past year or two. So we're not hearing a lot of that.  Two is that it's probably not a great market right now for a developer, mid-project, because of the cost of capital but the majority of our clients and the clients that we're seeing a lot of our backlog growth from are more blue-chip companies that they've got a heavy piece of their personal balance sheet and their own cash flows that are funding the projects. And they have a those companies have a tendency to look much longer term on interest rates, the price of energy demand in the market and then appreciating that some of these larger projects take upwards of 3 years to get put in place. So currently, I would say we're not seeing a major effect on our business on this award cycle. \nBrent Thielman : That's encouraging. I guess second was question was on LNG peak shaving projects. You've been really active there. And it sounds like the pipeline is pretty busy there with maybe some forthcoming opportunities as well. I think you mentioned the margin profile attached to these is pretty attractive. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a sense what those look like, maybe relative to kind of the long-term averages you expect from the business from a gross profit perspective. Can these be sort of accretive beyond those targets as you kind of get deeper into execution on them? \nJohn Hewitt: Those projects certainly support our consolidated long-range forecast for gross margins; and as we've said in the past, in the 10% to 12% range. I think one of the things that support that for those projects is it's a smaller competitive set for us and the risk and margin profile embedded in the entirety of the project gives us an opportunity to deliver on the margins we need to support the consolidated margin profile of the business. So the levels of contingency and escalation, projects were -- these are projects that are getting to be more repetitive, so we're able to appreciate the risks better and to manage the execution better that we're able to deliver on those margins. So I think those are a couple of reasons that help us drive the overall business to this more of a consolidated margin profile. \nKevin Cavanah : Yes. And I think what's key here is the consolidated margin profile. As John said, these projects have good margins, but it -- one of the other added benefits is that we've talked about under-recovery of construction overhead has been a big driver towards our margins not being where we want them to be. And so the volume from these projects will benefit us on that recovery of overhead. \nBrent Thielman : I guess the last one, I'll get back in queue. Kevin, I think you've sort of indicated look, as you start ramping up on these projects you should see increase in cash generation potential. You're essentially debt-free at this point. It seems like you could be building some cash on the balance sheet. I guess a two-part question would be, what do you start to think about doing with that cash, John or Kevin? And two, how do we think about kind of the conversion to cash or cash conversion, as again, you're start ramping up on these projects, just to get a feel for the cash potential this year? \nKevin Cavanah : So I do believe that our balance sheet position is going to improve as we move through the rest of the year. I think that's going to come from a couple of places. Number one is the improved financial results, just producing positive earnings is going to produce positive cash. Secondly, if you look at the mix of work we're going to do, Certainly, there'll be increases in repair and maintenance work that's reimbursable that we'll have to fund, but I think that will be more than offset by just the timing of cash flows on the capital projects. So I think that we'll be able to build cash.  And I think our initial focus on the use of that cash is going to be more internal making sure that we've got the right equipment needed for us to support that business. And as we've said before, we've been focused on really returning the company to profitability before we get too aggressive on either any other actions such as M&A, stock buyback, dividend, entity of that stuff. So those will be things we consider in the future, but focus this year is really about rebuilding the company's profitability, getting back to the financial targets that we've set. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti. \nJohn Franzreb : John, congratulations on another great bookings quarter. I want to start right there. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've relocated -- reallocated resources from procurement to execution, does that kind of suggest that we should think that the incoming booking profile will be a little bit more muted in the next quarter or two as you move to execution, especially in light of the fact that you also mentioned there are some large projects out there you think that are certainly near-term opportunities? \nJohn Hewitt: I don't think, we have not taken our foot off the gas pedal as it relates to continuing to book projects and awards. These things have a tendency to come in, in like waves on the ocean. And we've certainly had a strong wave here in the past couple of quarters. And we've seen it coming, right? So we appreciate the timing of when our clients are going to be making decisions on some of these larger projects. And so we're not taking our foot off the gas pedal, right? We're continuing to pursue projects, to build backlog. We're looking out into the future. How we're going to continue to take a bigger share of that market related to our storage, brand position in that market.  And but to effectively chase some of that work, we do engage our project teams and to -- not only to help plan and create the estimates and the budgets for that work, but also to talk to our clients, our potential client, about the projects about how we're going to execute it. Very important for us to put our project and field management in front of our clients. But yes, they will -- they are starting to transition over into the execution phases we continue to have proposal specific people that that's what they do for the organization. And so that doesn't change. And so they will combine with our business development teams are continuing to pursue projects to build backlog out in the future. \nJohn Franzreb : And clearly, the under-absorption issue has been a problem for some time. Kevin certainly said that the second half of the year is where we'll probably migrate to a much better situation. It seems to me that's largely going to be led by storage and to a lesser extent, the utility business, but the process will be lagging a bit. Can you kind of review the outlook on the process side, when do you expect that business maybe to turn the corner? I know the expectation is for it to be down this year, but what's the depth and duration of that? \nKevin Cavanah : So first thing, I think we'll see pretty good growth in both Storage and the Utility segments. For Process and Industrial Facilities, we've got a number of things that are impacting the top line for that segment. We completed some work that previously have been trying to get done, but that was pretty significant for the company, an important step. We did sell a noncore business that in the fourth quarter of last year that impacts that segment.  But we've also had some good bookings in that segment. If you go back to -- I think it was the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we booked a large capital project, that project is a little unique. It's got a -- there's a longer runway before we really start seeing revenues on that project. It won't really start benefiting until the first quarter of fiscal '25 so we have visibility to seeing these revenues increase, but most of that will happen in the very first part of fiscal 2025. \nJohn Franzreb : And in regards to your long-term financial targets, I'm most interested in the 4.5% operating margin target. What kind of revenue profile and gross margin profile are you using to get that 4.5% op margin target? It's certainly better than what I was expecting by the end of next year. \nKevin Cavanah : There's a number of things that are going to -- that will go into us getting to that target. So we need to get revenue volume up. And we've talked previously that to get to where we're fully recovering our construction overheads, we probably need at least $250 million of quarterly revenue to get there. But we also want to get the SG&A percentage down to 6.5% or lower. So in order for that to happen, we probably need that revenue to be even higher than that, getting it up to $275 million or so in a quarter. So those are two big drivers.  And then the third one is just what's the margin opportunity in the full backlog of the business between the capital projects and the repair and maintenance projects, and that needs to be north of 10%. So the combination of those three things are what's going to get us to the 4.5%. And as I said in my comments, all three of those areas are going to improve and be helping us move toward that make a significant step for those financial targets as we complete the fiscal year. \nJohn Franzreb : And I guess one last pesky question, regarding the tax rate, you mentioned that you expect it to be approaching zero this year. How does that look in 2025, what's the step function up? \nKevin Cavanah : So I think it will be near zero this year. I mean there's always unique tax issues that could adjust that. So it could be zero to 5% somewhere this year. Next year, we'll still be utilizing a lot of reserved tax assets. So I currently back the envelope projecting that to be somewhere around 10% next year. That's my best guess at this point. \nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to John Hewitt for any closing remarks. \nJohn Hewitt: Couple of things real quickly. First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for your hard work for your dedication to quality and the teamwork that's gone into delivering on the -- not only on the strong awards but also to our execution strategy and improvement in the business overall.  I certainly want to thank our shareholders for your support through this period. And would leave everybody, again, with a reminder on your personal safety awareness to ask those three questions: What am I about to do? How can I get hurt? What am I going to do about it? And to remember for our employees that you do have the authority to stop work and you have the obligation to do that as well, if you see something or feel something that is unsafe.  Other than that, I'm glad to spend time with everybody today and look forward to seeing you in future conferences and calls. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
