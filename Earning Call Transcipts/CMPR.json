I will introduce Meredith Burns, Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability.\nMeredith Burns : Thank you, Michelle, and thank you everyone for joining us. With us today are Robert Keane, our Founder; Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Sean Quinn; EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We really appreciate the time that you have dedicated to understand our results, commentary and outlook. This live Q&A session will last about 45 minutes and will answer both pre-submitted and live questions. You could submit questions live via the questions and answers box at the bottom left of your screen. Before we start, I'll note that in this session, we will make statements about the future. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risk factors that are outlined in detail in our SEC filings and in the documents we published yesterday on our website. We also have published non-GAAP reconciliations for our financial results and outlook on our IR website. We invite you to read them. And now I will turn things over to Sean for some brief remarks before we take questions. Sean?\nSean Quinn : Thanks a lot, Meredith, and thanks to everyone who's joined us today or on the recording. Before I take your questions along with Robert and Meredith, just want to highlight a few key points from the financial results and the updated outlook that we published yesterday. First of all, Cimpress delivered strong results in the second quarter. Our consolidated revenue grew 9% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew $55 million year-over-year in Q2 to $266 million and adjusted EBITDA margins were up nearly 500 basis points to 18.1% this year with gross margin expansion, leverage in advertising spend and reduced operating expenses. That was also helped by more favorable input costs compared to last year, and there were also a few beneficial year-over-year improvements that will not repeat that we called out in the earnings document as well. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter increased significantly year-over-year by $96 million with the higher adjusted EBITDA, but also significantly more favorable net working capital compared to the year ago period, which was helped by the normalization of our working capital trends. While we had growth in EBITDA across all of our segments, as you would have seen in the release, Vista experienced significant profitability expansion on strong results for its holiday peak. Vista's revenue grew 9% on an organic constant currency basis, which was better than expected. We saw strong growth across business product categories, but we also had 7% growth in our consumer products category. We continue to benefit from the range of improvements made in recent years that we talked about extensively in our last two Investor Days. Total customer count and also gross profit per customer both grew this quarter. So, we're continuing that multiyear trend of improved per customer value, but with growth in total customers as we did in the first quarter. I think beyond the quarter, it's worth taking a step back for just a moment and reflecting on the last year. One year ago, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $228 million. Now, at the end of December, it's $438 million a 92% increase in one year and that's still with material year-over-year benefits ahead next quarter from our prior cost reductions that haven't yet impacted reported results. One year ago, our net leverage was 5.5 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as defined by our credit agreement, now it's 2.87 times nearly halved in one year. Importantly, we've achieved that while still maintaining significant organic investment. With two quarters remaining in the fiscal year that puts us on a run rate that exceeds our prior profitability and net leverage guidance that we established for FY24, which we had already increased since we first introduced that more specific guidance one year ago. And lastly, one year ago we had cash and marketable securities of $214 million and we had no access to our revolving credit facility. Now, we ended December with cash and marketable securities of $291 million, we have full access to our $250 million revolving credit facility. And over that time in the last year, we also used $70 million of our capital to purchase $78 million of notional value of our high yield notes. Turning to our updated outlook for the full-year. Our organic constant currency revenue guidance for FY24 of at least 5% is consistent with what we experienced in the first half of the year and down slightly from our prior guidance of at least 6%. We think that's appropriate to reflect the lower than expected revenue growth that we've seen in our upload and print businesses and build a sign. Given our strong profitability and cash flow performance, we've raised our FY24 adjusted EBITDA guidance to at least $455 million and we now expect that to convert to free cash flow at approximately 45%. That compares to our prior guidance of at least $425 million and conversion to free cash flow at approximately 40%. If you do the math of our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as of December and what we've already disclosed for year-over-year cost savings that we expect in the third quarter of approximately $25 million and you back off unfavorable currency impact for the remainder of the year that we've also disclosed which is $8.5 million, that math will get you to $455 million. And so you might ask why our guidance isn't higher after the extent of year-over-year growth we had in the first half of the year beyond those cost savings and unfavorable currency impact. The second half of the year is definitely a harder comp from a profitability perspective. I think if you look at the quarterly profile of last year's just the segment EBITDA margins, you'll see that. There were also a few benefits in Q2 we called out in the earnings document that we won't have again. That's not to say there's an opportunity for further growth in the second half of the year, but we've maintained this at least construct and we want to be realistic about where we set that. We're, as you know, incentivized to continue improving our business and our financial results and that's what we'll remain focused on. Our boards also authorized share repurchases of up to $150 million which doesn't have a defined time frame set against it. Given the progress that I've just outlined, we're now in a position to have this as an option for capital allocation. Any share repurchases in the remainder of this fiscal year will be done with the expectation of exiting FY24 with net leverage at or below approximately 3.0 times, trailing 12-month EBITDA as defined by our credit agreement. And I would note that that's an improvement from our prior net leverage guidance that we established at the beginning of the year of exiting FY24 at or below 3.25 times. With that, Meredith, why don't we open it up for questions?\nA - Meredith Burns: That's great. Thank you, Sean. Okay. So, we're going to jump in on a couple of questions about the quarter. So, Sean, I'll kick the first couple to you. First one, which product or family of products have had the most impact on Vista's outperformance in the quarter?\nSean Quinn: Sure. Yes, we've made a few, kind of directional comments about this quarter and the release. The revenue performance in Vista, it was strong across the Board. I'll come to the product category question, but maybe to start, the growth was pretty similar across all of our regions, the North America, Europe, Australia. Europe was just slightly out ahead of the pack, but really a balanced growth story across regions. And then from, in terms of our incremental revenue, though, in North America, was definitely the largest, and the over performance relative to our expectations was mostly in North America as well. In terms of product categories, all categories had double-digit bookings growth other than business cards and consumer in Q2. Relative to our expectations, though, I would say consumer was the product category that sticks out partly because we set pretty modest expectations there because some of those products, things like holiday cards or calendars, we don't get to experience throughout the year. So, we had modest expectations. We exceeded them. But, again, strong across many categories. I think, one might read the commentary and think consumer is what drove the quarter. But remember, Vista had 9% organic constant currency growth overall. And so mathematically, with consumer at 7%, all the other categories together were more than 9%. And just in terms of the absolute dollars of growth, Vista had $47 million of year-over-year, incremental growth. To put that in perspective, while consumer was really important in that, it was a little more than $7 million of that growth and so there was a lot of strength elsewhere too.\nMeredith Burns: Thank you, Sean. And certainly a related question here, what drove the 7% growth in the consumer segment? And can it sustain mid to high-single-digit growth under the new model?\nSean Quinn: There were a lot of contributors. To start, I think that the team really did a great job in the planning and in the execution. We always do a very extensive deep dive, to assess what we can do better. And that's actually something that we've already, is well underway, even for next year's holiday peak. But the team was able to take action on the things identified, from last year, and those are things that have to get worked on throughout the year to improve the experience to add new features, add new products, evolve our go-to-market approach across our markets and so on. So, I think the team did a really good job in all that planning and execution, and that was really over the last full year. There's also the fact that, it's not like consumer is a wholly separate business. We define it based on product category, but these are customers that are interacting with the site and being put through the same experience improvements, the same reduced friction in our checkout, the same improvements to design help, improvements in terms of how we're using data, improvements in site search, more efficient advertising. All the other things that we've been talking about, that are actually a big part of why the other product categories had the strength I just mentioned too. I think the consumer categories also benefited from the fact that, we've had healthier new customer acquisition cohorts, in the last quarters. And there are many hybrid customers in there that are purchasing across categories. They tend to be some of the most valuable customers in our customer file. So those are some of the things that impacted the revenue performance. As we noted in the release, it was the first time that we had year-over-year consumer products growth since we started the transformation journey in Vista in 2019. And you may recall back then we pretty significantly reduced discounting and advertising. And that was, that had a big impact on consumer, because there were some things that we were doing in the consumer category that were destroying capital or not producing sufficient returns so we made some big changes there. So, it's great to see that back to growth and doing what it's doing. But it actually goes beyond just revenue. And so maybe just highlight a few other things. In our production facilities, we also had really good execution. Just as an example of that, last year, In Europe, there were labor supply challenges in the holiday ramp, which increased cost. Team did a really nice job this year, changing how we approach workforce management, driving a lot of efficiency versus last year from a labor perspective and doing all that while maintaining a high on time delivery to customers. In our customer care, those teams, another area where we've made continuous improvement throughout the last year, but the team has really been focused on removing friction for customers, improving training for our team members, improving visibility of help on placement on the site. And we've been able to reduce contacts as well because we've improved the site experience, but also we've improved these elements of how our care teams interact with customers. And so, all of that has led to about 100 basis points of savings just in our customer care versus last year. So, I mentioned those because it's not just revenue, it really is across the Board it was a strong performance. There's a lot that's gone into that, and hopefully, that's been a theme you pick up over the last quarters, which is, it's a lot of little things an improved execution and focus that ultimately has driven the results.\nMeredith Burns: That's great. Thank you, Sean. All right. I'm going to move over to Robert for, one of our pre-submitted questions. So, Robert, what is ailing upload and print other than the tough year-over-year comps in the half of the year? What are you doing to fix it? And how should we think about it, about the sustainable growth in that segment?\nRobert Keane: Okay. Well, thanks for the question. First of all, let me say hello to everyone and like Meredith and Sean, welcome you to the call. To answer the question, I will start by saying we see these businesses, the upload and print businesses, as healthy, not as ailing. We also are asking how we can continue their success and make them even stronger, which is an important question, but it's not a question of what we need to fix. So, of course, and I will come to this in a moment, we explained in our release that revenue growth was below our plan, but that doesn't change the overall picture. And let me explain that by starting with the success in driving up upload and print EBITDA and cash flow. As we've done across Cimpress, we are focusing on driving bottom line expansion to one show the underlying power of what we have as a business, but also to help with the corporate level delevering. And upload and print just expanded profitability, EBITDA, 41% year-over-year. And we have strong bottom line prospects looking forward. Specifically, if you look at the upload and print on the trailing 12-month basis, that's over $150 million which is driving again increased cash flow and cumulatively we've generated cash flow from this group that exceeds the capital we ever invested in them. And of course, there's value in the business today going forward to the returns have been already attractive and we're confident that those returns will continue to grow. So again, we see these healthy businesses. Now as to revenue, yes, it was lower than I expected, but it was in part due to making sure we drive the bottom-line, but also there were and you mentioned this in your question, high growth rates last year, we had a lap. But beyond that, I think there's two very important trends, which we have spoken about in the past, which is important to keep in mind, which are constraining near-term revenue, but which are good for Cimpress' upload and print our revenue outlook over the longer term. We are the undisputed European leader in selling direct to end customers through upload and print style, e-commerce printing, these are small orders traditionally relative to the commercial printing industry. And the industry continues to shift overall print, not just online towards smaller orders and we see that as playing to Cimpress' strength. And as those orders get smaller, it gets harder and harder for traditional printers to play in that. Secondly, we do see we have headwinds from resellers. Resellers are typically professional graphic, our graphic design professionals or local printers or the like who have traditionally been how and even today are how the majority of the Print industry transacts businesses. And especially in print group, but across our blood and print, we have a pretty material business selling to those resellers who in turn say to the end customer. But with the passage of time, those resellers are kind of systematically getting this intermediated and in large part by Cimpress' upload and print group as a leader in this space. So there's a channel shift there. But if you step back, that excluding that high concentration of reseller revenue, it is an overall positive picture. And we look to upload and print and the teams there is being, they are very innovative. They're very focused on being low cost producers. They have incredible supply chains and production capabilities, they serve customers incredibly well. And you can see in cohort value, especially defined as cash flow not revenues, you see these strong trends occurring. So they're going to keep doing what they're doing. There's a lot of good things happening there and we don't see this as a sign that the multiyear strength we've had in upload and print is anywhere near the end.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you, Robert. I'm going to shift to Sean for a technical question. So Sean, what accounted for the big share based compensation jump in the second quarter and is that an appropriate run rate?\nSean Quinn: Sure. Yes. Always good to have a couple of technical questions in here. The grants that we made this year were a combination of instruments, performance share units or PSUs and also RSUs. In terms of why the increase in share-based compensation expense, the total grant value for all of our annual grants we do is a little bit higher than last year, but there's really two things that drove the, the higher expense in Q2. The first one is that for the PSUs and in terms of Robert, myself, other executive officers have all of our long-term incentives and PSUs. So, it's a large part of the overall share based compensation for this year. The way that those are required to be accounted for is on an accelerated basis. And so what ends up happening to spare you the details is that about 50% of the expense gets taken in year one. And that compares to like if there's an RSU with a four-year vesting period, about 25% of the expense we get taken in year one. So, you do get just in terms of how it's accounted for higher cost in year one than our pass profile. The second one is that the PSUs and the expense that we take for PSUs is variable depending on our attainment against the performance conditions. Those performance conditions are based on our revenue, EBITDA and our number of cash flow for this year. And we've updated those estimates of attainment percentages based on our results, which we're strong and so that attainment percentage is a bit higher. And so that also played a role. You'll see in our non-GAAP reconciliations, we actually walked this and so we increased our full-year expectation for share based compensation expense from $60 million to $65 million for FY24. Again, just remember that some of that is driven by this feature of accelerated expensing for the PSUs with 50% of that cost in year one. As to, I think the question also asked that that's a good reflection of the run rate. I think it really depends on sort of the intermediate use. [Technical Difficulty], I think that's a fair run rate. We're continuing with PSUs year long on an accelerated basis, so that'll kind of more and more be layered into the expense profile.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thanks so much, Sean. Okay. This next question is for Robert. Robert, can you update us on customer experience enhancements in Vista that are driving improvements customer satisfaction, new customer acquisition cohorts, and customer lifetime value?\nRobert Keane: Sure. Let me tell you first of all, the main point about these customer experience improvements is that we are increasing the cadence and the velocity of continuous improvements of many small things, not relying on step function changes, and that's very powerful. But there are too many to cover all of these. I will give you some very specific examples, but there's a lot of them. Sean also covered this to some extent in his response to the consumer question earlier, and I'll come to that. Now you mentioned specifically acquisition cohorts and customer lifetime value and customer satisfaction. I think that in terms of cohorts, we have, there's two major factors. How much value is there per customer, the LTV, and how many customers? And the improvements we've been making for the last 5 years have consistently driven up the value per customer. I think a lot of what's happening is we are continuing that trend with consumer customer facing experience improvements. But very importantly, the second factor, the number of new customers are now starting to get traction and it's certainly an important part, our customer experience is certainly an important part of that, but it also has a lot of great work in the marketing teams and others to find ways to drive that. So, in terms of some examples, I think you really have to look back for the last 4 or 5 years and see we started with some very large brute force changes, moving our discount level is down dramatically. We still discount, but much less certain in the past. Change in how we advertise, change in how we talk about our business and our, the customer value we deliver. We spent more than 3 years migrating the technology stack, and only finished that up 18 months ago. We invested in talent in a lot of different areas. We didn't do all that right, but we made a lot of good decisions. And we are now seeing 18 months after the tech migration, about 15 months after committing to move to what are known as empowered product teams. We're seeing that a lot of those things are starting to click, the teams are able to be more focused on improvements rather than these big shifts, and that it comes down to things that matter to our customers. So as two examples, I could start with site search. It could be, that's much better than it has been in the past. We think we can make it better. Mobile first design flows are reducing the friction of checkout, improving the layout of the homepage or some of the core merchandising pages to improve findability. The pace of new product introduction is coming up dramatically from where it was a year ago. It's still not where we think it can be and it's not at the pace we see in our upload and print businesses, but it's improving. We've improved design service offerings and started to integrate those more deeply in the experience. We've taken learnings from VistaCreate and we're bringing those into the core of VistaPrint experience. We're acquiring, as I mentioned, more customers that it certainly comes from great marketing improvement, but also very importantly improved conversion rates, because of the site improvements. And so finally, we've done a lot of work on product quality and on time to customer and customer service improvements, which has multiple effects. One is, it improves our retention rates, which has huge value of the cohorts. And two, it's driven down our credit rate. We still have a very customer centric approach to credit, but as we make fewer mistakes, we will make we issue fewer credits and that's healthy. So I'll stop there, but really I would summarize by saying there's no one silver bullet, which has changed things, we see this as an overall acceleration of the velocity, the faster cadence of new product or new customer facing improvements, and we think that will continue.\nMeredith Burns: It's just really exciting to see that inside the Company as well and just, like, adding my own editorial comments here. Let's move to the next question, Robert, I'm going to stick with you. How far along are you in the process of integrating more robust design services into the Vista customer experience? Can you give us a progress update on VistaCreate in terms of user growth and other key metrics that you're tracking?\nRobert Keane: Great. So there are a couple of questions there. There's design services overall, and there's VistaCreate specifically. So Florian in our most recent Investor Day spoke about exposing design services from the 99designs community to VistaPrint customers. We have taken a slow approach there, it's taken longer than I would have originally expected. I think any of us would have. But again, a lot of that was related to a need to fix some of the other things I just talked about in terms of tech migrations, new product team structures and so on. But we are seeing the benefits when by making that smoother for customers who need design help get it and we're going to continue to test and learn and incorporate improvements into the experience. And importantly, we are now working to say how can we make sure the flow between, if you think of a spectrum from getting customer service to getting customer service based help to getting a professional to help you, making sure that that's a smooth transition back and forth, for customers who at different points in their customer journey need different types of service. With ultimate design overall, more pervasive through the customer experience, how design agents. We know the design customer service agents and we know that designers from the 99designs network have much higher LTV. So, making incremental improvements has helped the, I would put that in the category of what I spoke about for the prior question, it's an example of improving satisfaction, conversion, revenue, profitability. If you go into the site, you'll see a lot more offers for design help for custom or bespoke design support on the homepage, in the studio, in chat boxes that pop-up and on pages for more complex products. We also have the team is driving mobile offerings with a range of design options and experiences, which is very much related to 99designs and work that we've done since we've acquired 99designs. We are incorporating the VistaCreate capabilities into the VistaDesign studio within Vista Print that is taking time because of the architectural underlying components. But we are on a trajectory of making incremental studio experiences to make it better for our customers. And you can see some of this, for instance, the logo maker where you download the finished logo and a brand kit, that's now available in Vista Create as well. And so finally, I'd say, we see how we move forward with the VistaCreate and 99designs acquisitions less of building them or not as building with standalone businesses, but rather exposing the services and capabilities in using the talent we acquired with that to improve the VistaPrint experience overall, where the real value is for customers because of the size of Vista Print and for shareholders because of the size of the revenues and cash flows out of Vista Print.\nMeredith Burns: Thank you, Robert. Okay. I'm going to stick with you for one more question before I let you off the hook. Robert, how is customer adoption of the Vista x Wix digital offering progressing?\nRobert Keane: First of all, we have a 100% completed migration off of our legacy website builder product to the Wix website builder. We finished that up in the first quarter. And it is just a much better customer experience full stop, and we're happy with that. We also see the value per customer is materially better, our value per customer in terms of cash flows. Progress has been good. It's still a situation where most of our focus is continuing to optimize how we integrate what is a third-party holding controlled product experience, the Wix experience, which we really see is great for customers and make sure it integrates into our site well and making sure the funnel that drives customers there is working, removing friction for customers. Now that the bulk of the effort, which was getting all of the legacy site builder customers migrated to Wix is over, we can focus more on those things. Digital bookings grew year-over-year in Q2, just we finished up, they also did in Q1, and we expect digital revenues to grow, again, on a full year basis. And as we move forward. We think we're seeing an uptick in customers, but again an uptick, material uptick in the lifetime value of each customer. So in summary, we are happy with where the Vista x Wix digital offering is. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us, but it's going in the right direction.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks Robert. Sean, I'm going to ask you a question now, And that is, what is the implied growth for Vista in the second half of the year in the 7% revenue guide. So 7% reported guide or 5% organic constant currency guide.\nSean Quinn: Yes. We haven't given revenue guidance at a segment level for the remainder of the year. So maybe just a few things to cloud. The comps in H2, as you can see, are different depending on the segment and when price changes were happening last year. I think that, I think you can assume that the Vista expectations in the second half of the year are close to the consolidated organic constant currency guidance that we gave of at least 5%. Probably won't get more specific. And that as for, the reported revenue growth, in general, there's going to be less based on the current rates, we expect less currency impact in the second half of the year. And so right now for Vista, I would expect that the reported growth and the organic constant currency growth would be quite close together.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you. Another one for you, Sean. As you mentioned, Input prices are lowering and revenue per customer is increasing. What's the response from customers to price increases? And how are you able to lower prices to attract upload and print?\nSean Quinn: On the, from a price perspective, we there hasn't really been much change over the last quarter, in our direct increase, decrease. As I said last quarter, we find ourselves now in more kind of optimization mode. So I don't expect any step function changes, upward or downward based on, what we see today. It's more back into the continuous optimization, testing based on price elasticity, and so on. So that's the mode that we're, that we've been in. I think one of the things to consider is that the pace of input cost increases in part of our business and take paper costs, for example, was extremely high. And so we weren't just passing that all on, and there were parts of that business where we were having to absorb a piece of that. In paper costs, for example, and some regions go up 50% or more, that's not something that you can just the next day pass on. And so I think that over time, as input costs have settled in, combined with the pricing steps that we did take over the last 18 months or so. We're at an equilibrium that right now feels like that's okay. And again, we'll continue to optimize within that. In terms of, are you able to lower prices to attract upload and print? We haven't seen the need to do so. Again, we'll continue to test and optimize. But orders are still growth, and so it's in upload and print, it's really the things that Robert talked about earlier in terms of some of the headwinds there for growth. So I don't expect big changes in the near-term. And also, we did not make big changes, over the last quarter, not only in upload and print, but elsewhere too.\nMeredith Burns: Next one, I'm going to ask Robert. Have you done the math on what upload and print's growth rate was in the quarter excluding the reseller channel?\nRobert Keane: Yes. We've done the math. We don't disclose that publicly, one, because every business in the world, has overall results and profits to contain a mix of different growth rates of different segments, but also for competitive reasons. But I can give you a little bit of context here. Now remember that our Upload and Print businesses, every single one of them have reseller business. But Exa and TradePrint, which are part of the Print Group, traditionally were a 100% reseller. And they are shifting away, but they really started with a 100% reseller. Whereas WIRmachenDRUCK, Printi and Pixartprinting, well, the first three of those, excluding Pixartprinting are part of PrintBrothers. Pixartprinting is part of the Print Group, also has resellers, but a much it's a minority of their business. So, we see the most headwinds in the Print Group because of the traditional focus of two other businesses on resellers. Now a good number to look at is PrintBrothers, where again we do have reseller businesses, which are reseller customers that are material, not majority. Yes, PrintBrothers is still growing at about 5% a year. So again, there's a mix within that of resellers and direct. I think, I'd come back to the main point that if you think out 10 years from now, where is the world going? The world is going more and more to direct relationships across the Internet with end customers and, the ability to sell directly from our factory floors out to those customers without going through intermediary is long-term good for the economics of Cimpress.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks, Robert. All right. Another question here for Sean. Capital allocation question. Sean, any, plans to buy back more bonds?\nSean Quinn: No specific plans. As we said in the, in our release last night, we've obviously, we've been a buyer of our bonds over the last three quarters. We'll continue to consider using excess liquidity to repurchase our debt. That's not exclusive to the bonds could be any of our debt. And, but, yeah, no specific plans. But as you can see, it's something that we'll regularly look at and we have been looking at. And, yes, we'll see where things go.\nMeredith Burns: Fantastic. All right. So with that, we have come to the end of the set of questions. There was another question that came on, about the holiday season. I think, the asker maybe came on to the call a little bit late because we did cover the holiday season in quite a bit of detail at the beginning of the call. So, I can write to, that person after the call. And you can always listen to the trans or re-listen to the replay or read the transcript to catch our answer on that one. So, I'm just going to turn things over to Robert to wrap things up.\nRobert Keane: Well, thank you to all of you for joining the call and for continuing to entrust us with your capital. We are really happy to be ahead of our plans for the bottom line profit and cash flow, and by reducing our net leverage. We have, I think a lot of options in front of us. But very importantly, and Sean said this before and we said this in the release, we are happy to do so while continuing to invest in key areas for the future. And so we think that success it is a combination of different factors, but, you know, stepping way back, being able to focus on execution after a series of changes that started with the Vista Print transformation five years ago that went through the pandemic, which went through a lot of fundamental changes of how we run the business. But we are seeing the benefits of that focus. We look forward to continuing to build the momentum from here and we think we're on the right track to improved our intrinsic value per share for a long time to come. Thank you again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day and you may now disconnect."

I will introduce Meredith Burns, Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability.\nMeredith Burns: Thank you, Tanya, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. With us today are Robert Keane, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Quinn, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. I hope you've all had a chance to read our earnings document published yesterday. We appreciate the time you have dedicated to understand our results, commentary, and outlook. This live Q&A session will last 45 minutes to an hour, and we'll answer both pre-submitted and live questions. You can submit questions live via the questions and answers box at the bottom left of your screen. Before we start, I'll note that in this session, we will make statements about the future. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risk factors that are outlined in detail in our SEC filings and in the documents we published yesterday on our website. We also have published non-GAAP reconciliations for our financial results and outlook on our IR website. We invite you to read them. And now I will turn things over to Sean for some brief remarks before we take questions. Sean?\nSean Quinn: Thanks a lot Meredith, and thanks to everyone who has joined us today. Before we take questions, I'll just highlight a few key points from the financial results and also the updated outlook that we published yesterday. First of all, we delivered solid results in the first quarter. Consolidated revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic constant currency basis. Growth did vary by segment and it was also reduced by approximately 200 basis points from year-over-year revenue timing changes. Consolidated profits were very strong. Adjusted EBITDA grew $43 million year-over-year in Q1 to $89 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up from 6.5% last year to 11.7% this year. This benefited from gross margin expansion from leverage and advertising spend and reduced operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA expansion over the last three quarters has been very significant. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of September was $383 million, and that compares to $228 million at the end of December, a 68% increase in just nine months and still with a significant benefit from our prior cost reductions yet to impact those reported results. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter increased significantly year-over-year by just over $63 million with a higher adjusted EBITDA and also a significantly more favorable in net working capital compared to the year ago period, which was helped by returns to more normalized inventory patterns. I won't go through all of the segments here today. But given the significance of the profitability expansion in Vista, let me just share some highlights there. This is revenue grew 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Overall, revenue growth was driven by approximately even contribution from growth in orders and then higher average order values. The higher average order value is driven by both product mix and pricing. Revenue grew across geographic markets and across product lines with the fastest growth continuing to come from our promotional products apparel and gifts category, signage and packaging and labels. There's a lot of investor focus on Europe these days, and I'll note that for Vista, growth in Europe was quite strong in Q1. Vista segment EBITDA grew $44 million versus last year, which similar to last quarter was driven by a balanced mix of revenue growth, gross margin expansion, lower advertising spend as a percentage of revenue, which decreased and materially lower operating costs as a result of the cost reductions that we announced back in March. Importantly, in Vista, We're also seeing continued improvements in per customer value, which is a trend that's been in place for the past several years. But we're now also doing that while growing the customer base year-over-year, which grew by more than 100,000 customers in the first quarter. That was primarily driven by new customer growth and those new customers generated record levels of in-quarter variable gross profit per customer when compared to past Q1 new customer cohorts. There are many small improvements that contribute to this and there remains a lot of opportunity for more of these improvements, which can have a meaningful impact on our overall customer experience, conversion rate, and financial results, and that's where our focus is. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $148 million, even after we purchased $21 million notional value of our 7% senior notes, for just under $20 million. Net leverage decreased sequentially to just over 3.5 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as defined by our credit agreement. As we talked about on recent calls, from a balance sheet perspective, we've been prioritizing reduction in net leverage and that's happening at a good pace. Moving to our outlook. Given our strong Q1 profitability and cash flow performance, we're raising our FY 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to at least $425 million, and we continue to expect that to convert to free cash flow at approximately 40%. Our organic constant currency revenue guidance of at least 6% remains unchanged. We recognize there's some macroeconomic uncertainty in most parts of the world, and we'll of course be monitoring that as it relates to future revenue commentary. Our expectation is still to end the year with net leverage that is below 3.25 times. So, that also remains unchanged. And with that, Meredith, why don't we open it up for questions?\nA - Meredith Burns: You bet. Thanks Sean. [Operator Instructions] So we'll get to as many as we can and make sure we get to a variety of top it around people's minds. So the first question, is I'm going to throw it to Sean. So on a reported basis, Vista Europe grew at 17% year-over-year, which we assume translates to 8% to 9% once FX effects are removed. Are we thinking about this the right way? And if so, what is driving faster organic constant currency growth in Europe versus North America?\nSean Quinn: Yes. Thanks. Just so everyone knows on the call, we publish financial and operating metrics each quarter, which we post on our Investor Relations site and that's where the data is that would have prompted this question. The constant currency revenue growth in Vista Europe, as actually just above 10%. So it was a little higher than the math that whomever asked the question was doing. And that was indeed higher than North America, but both regions perform well. I would say that even beyond just the revenue growth in Europe being just above 10%, gross profit grew at a higher rate there and contribution profit grew at an even higher rate. And so, again, overall, a very strong quarter for Vista, but also in particular in Europe. At a category level, there's two areas to call out in terms of where, performance was, or growth was higher in Europe and that would be in packaging and labels and also in marketing materials. Those two categories happen to be the ones that benefit the most from leveraging new product introduction, from fulfillment from other Cimpress businesses in Europe, which there's not that same opportunity in North America. The combination of the technology migration that we did last year, which just to keep in mind, there were the latest markets to be migrated were a few of our large European markets. So, kind of the benefit of that is a little bit delayed. And there's also organizational changes that we put in place back in March. And I think the combination of technology migration and those organizational changes has allowed the team, to have more focus in Europe and also to move more quickly to have customer impact in those markets versus a year ago. There were pretty meaningful improvements in customer credit rates that was notable in Europe, due to a lot of the work of our customer care teams that's beneficial to revenue. That was also a good trend in North America, just a little bit better in Europe. And then I would say we've also been able to take the learnings from other markets, both from an advertising spend perspective, but also in areas like pricing, or how we're thinking about promotionality, and bring those to, some of our European markets in ways that we haven't before and that is that is definitely having an impact. So, in general, I would say it's primarily, micro factors rather than macro factors that delivered the differential performance.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you, Sean. All right. So, we're going to stick with revenue here and we've had several questions trying to really sort of pick apart the differential growth rates by segments, and some of the, the timing impacts there. So, I'll ask one question and touch on the other, other questions that came in on this and you can cover all of them at once in detail. So, in a lot of ways, it was a strong quarter, but revenue growth rates declined sequentially in all segments and are lower than your annual growth expectation. What were the key contributing factors to that? And given your continued confidence in the annual growth rate, was the decline this quarter expected? And then the other questions around this are really getting at, the growth rates in our Upload and Print businesses, and why there was a difference between those two groups?\nSean Quinn: Yes. Okay. I'll do my best here. Yes, first of all, agree with the overall sentiment we believe that it was a strong quarter. Profitability and cash flow were quite strong. But there was some variability in the revenue growth. So, I'll dive into that. There's I had mentioned in the opening remarks, there's about 200 basis points of timing impacts too that that are a drag on consolidated growth rate. Over half of that, we'll benefit revenue in the remainder of the year. As backlog normalizes, there's really nothing to that other than timing. So, just know that that had some impact. And then I would also just keep in mind that the expectations that we set coming into the year was that we were going to have lower growth, and particularly in our Upload and Print businesses as we lap pricing changes from last year and so on. In terms of how we performed versus our expectations, generally speaking, let's say Vista was right on plan, other than the timing impact that I outlined, we feel good about the quarter there. The fact that per customer value continue to improve while customer counts also grew, as I noted, I think is a is a good signal as well. So, System was right on track and solid quarter. And Upload and Print, those, both of those segments within Upload and Print, each grew over 20% in Q1 last year in constant currency. So, we're lapping that, we're lapping pricing, increases. So, it's still a tough comp. But relative to expectations, there, I'd say it's a little bit more of a nuanced story and you kind of have to get down to the country category channel level to better understand that. There are, in certain markets, we're seeing either stable or increasing orders. But some indication of customers purchasing lower quantities per order, in some categories. So, a little bit of a trade down there in some categories. We also, saw softer revenue trends in our reseller channels, which just from an overall Cimpress perspective, is relatively small. It's roughly mid-single-digits percentage of revenue for, overall for Cimpress, but it does impact the growth for some of these businesses in the Upload and Print group. And that's one reason that growth was lower for print group. Within Upload and Print just because there's more concentration on a relative basis, in the reseller channel, especially in France. That is a trend that's been present for some time. And it's a trend that, has benefited the Cimpress overall in the long-term. A bucking way on growth in the near-term for some individual businesses to have more concentration there. So, we do expect that will continue to be somewhat of a headwind, to near-term growth for those businesses that have more concentration and resellers. I think important to note that, in Upload and Print, despite lower overall growth segment EBITDA still grew year-over-year, and that was helped by, lower input costs that we've experienced so far this quarter. And we expect that to be a feature for the remainder of the year as well. I'm not going to get through all the other segments. I think those are the most notable takeaways As we've mentioned in the question we held our revenue guidance for the year. There will be variability as we go throughout the year in terms of growth rates by quarter as we lap pricing and also as we previously said, we expect the growth rate in the December quarter in Vista to be weighed down, somewhat by, consumer concentration during the holiday peak. But based on what we've seen, we still felt confident leaving the revenue guidance untouched.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks Sean. One more quick question for you, Sean on revenue. Can you elaborate on the backlog that provided a $4.3 million drag on revenues during the quarter? Was it isolated to one product category or was this something, that was broad based -- not within Vista?\nSean Quinn: Yes. We always have fluctuations in the backlog, which is the orders that we've received, but we haven't yet shipped. There's really nothing to read into on that one and not specific to a category. Those fluctuations have to do with things like, what, what, what's the last calendar day of the quarter end, but also things like timing of promotions as we cross the quarter end or seasonality and we don't try and manage that in any natural ways as we as we end the quarter. From an economic standpoint, all that really doesn't matter. In Vista, we receive the cash, upfront from customers. And it's just that there was a higher level of orders not yet shipped in the last day of the quarter. So, that'll come into revenue when they do ship, and that's really it. But it does impact growth rate, year-over-year.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks, Sean. Okay. Let's get Robert, involved here. And, we've got some questions on the Vista, customer additions. So, the 100,000 customer additions referenced in the earnings document, could you add some additional context such as what the percentage increase was, what the percentage of the total? And then, very similar question you specifically noted that Vista grew its customer base year-over-year by more than 100,000 customers. Does this represent a recent quarterly high for new Vista customer additions? What is the size of the total Vista customer base currently?\nRobert Keane: Okay. Well, thanks for the question. First of all, two words were used there. One is customer base and customer additions. So, it really is customer base that we referred to, repeat customers plus new customers or, in other words, plus customer additions. So, it was good growth. New customers drove that growth. They the number of new customers grew 13% versus the same quarter of the prior year. Repeat customers were still down slightly year-over-year, but that is a trailing metric after the new customer acquisitions. And the trend in repeat customer count also improved sequentially. So, we have overall growth in the customer base. We don't go into a lot of the details that you asked about specifically, but let me give some additional context. First of all, It's very important to keep in mind the customer count on its own is not the metric we seek to grow. We certainly wanted to grow, but it's not the only metric. It's important to know that we care most of all about the profitability per cohort and to get to that, you need to also look at how much gross profit per customer we are generating, what's that worth over the life of a customer expressed in NPV terms, and what's the cost of customer acquisition relative to that lifetime value. So, it's a factor in the equation, but it's not the, the, the top number we're looking at. And that focus on economic value holistically, is why compared to going back five years or so in our history, for the last multiple years, we have seen, a reduction in customer count as we've moved away from the prior value proposition, which was based on very deep discounts towards higher value customers. And in some of our multiple investor days over the last couple of years, we've shown charts and data, how We've greatly reduced economically negative results in our lowest decile or deciles, and we've strongly grown gross profit customer overall and in our top deciles, and very much driven by our top deciles. We also, over that multi year period, have really reduced value destructive advertising. We've greatly reduced, discounting, and we have focused on higher value products not we've done price increases, but even more so, we've moved to higher value products, before price increases. And Q1 was a continuation of all those trends. Gross profit per customer in this most recent quarter's acquisition cohort was higher than it ever has been in the first quarter of any year. The improvement in repeat customers of course, helps and we're happy about that and we are also focusing on driving repeat business by giving better value to these customers. And finally, in terms of increasing the number of customers going forward, we're optimistic about this. There's a lot that's gone into this. It's not just what we've done in the past one or two quarters. It goes back to the multi-year repositioning of the brand, the increasing awareness of our product breadth, accelerating into growth, areas of higher value products like promotional products, improving the customer experience. And they've had an earlier impact on value per customer, but they clearly now are improving our ability to acquire more customers. And so we're looking forward to seeing that continue.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks Robert. Really exciting development in Vista. All right, Sean, next question for you. We thought our Upload and Print businesses were nearing the end of an investment cycle, but we were surprised to see the uptick in capital expenditures this past quarter. What investments are we making here? And do we expect these to moderate?\nSean Quinn: Yes. Yes, this is a good question. The growth investment in our Upload and Print businesses in recent years has been relatively low, but, you're right to note that, this past quarter from a CapEx perspective, it was definitely a high CapEx quarter for these businesses. And that's not a new run rate. The equipment purchases that we make in those businesses. And in particular, in the Print group, which is, as more vertically integrated than the Print segment, can be a little bit lumpy over time. And there happened to be some large piece of equipment that were purchased this quarter. There was also within that, about $2 million of facilities related CapEx, which that doesn't occur often and so that's sort of a sort of a one off. But the rest of it is Print Production Equipment, those are investments that have clear payback and return thresholds, that have to be met. And some of that's maintenance CapEx as well. So, it wouldn't necessarily be captured in the growth investments that we that we outlined each year. So, yes, higher, intensity CapEx quarter for these businesses. That's not a new run rate and there is some lumpiness there. There's no change to our CapEx guidance for the year. And so that might be helpful in terms of when you look at the CapEx guidance that we provided for the full year and back off Q1, it would imply that, the rest of the year, it does not have that level of intensity. And so the quarterly run rate for the next three quarters will be lower.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks Sean. And also thanks to the person who asked that question, who is clearly looking at the detail in our financial and operating metrics that we posted on our website. All right. Next question, Sean, input costs are trending better than expected. Any additional color to share, where are you seeing the biggest benefits?\nSean Quinn: Yes. In general, input cost environment definitely continues to improve. We talked about this back at Investor Day a bit. I would say even since then, it's improved some. Paper costs have been coming down after what was very sharp increases that we experienced over the last two years. And that's happening more quickly in Europe. The pace of the decrease is happening more quickly in Europe than in North America, and that's definitely benefited gross margins. In markets where energy costs have really spiked last year, those are -- those costs are down meaningfully just as a point of reference in Italy, which was one of the countries where there was the most intense increase. The cost per kilowatt hour is less than half of what it was in Q1 last year. So, down quite a bit. Inbound freight costs are down meaningfully as well. So, those are probably the three that I would highlight. But as we noted in the release, the changes have been slightly more favorable than what we had planned for at the beginning of the year, and that's also now incorporated into our guidance.\nMeredith Burns: Great thank you. All right. One quick one here, and then we'll move into some outlook questions. So, can you provide an update on the cost reduction initiatives, Sean?\nSean Quinn: Yes, we gave quite a bit of detail back in March in our call back then and when we had made those changes. And just for recall, the total benefit that we had expected from the cost reductions was about $100 million. Some of that we got in FY 2023. And there's another $75 million of that $100 million, which was a year-over-year benefit that we expected to get this fiscal year, which is roughly evenly split between the first three quarters. We're on track with what we previously outlined. As we entered the year, the changes as related to any headcount impact, those changes had already been made prior to the beginning of the year. And then any decisions on things that were non-compensation reductions, those decisions were also made. So, it's really just a matter of the passage of time for us to see the remaining benefit over the next two quarters. So, maybe just to put it plainly, we're on track.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you. All right. Sean, a few quarters ago, we talked about how the consumer category remained important for Vista so much so that a dedicated team has been formed to focus on the category. With the all-important holiday season around the quarter, can you please give us an update on the outlook for consumer. We actually did have multiple questions on holiday outlook and that one is representative.\nSean Quinn: Yes, sure. So I'll give some overall comments here. We're going to give a specific holiday outlook, but it's an important part of the year. From a consumer perspective, it has come down overall in the mix, Cimpress overall to less than 10% of our overall revenue. But the December quarter is an important one from a consumer perspective, particularly in Vista, but then also in BuildASign as well. In Vista consumer revenue has declined in the last few years and some of that is just from behavior change that happened through the pandemic, especially in invitations and announcements, that's probably the most pronounced. And what we've said recently is that the profit pool for consumer in Vista is a very important one, and it's one that we definitely want to protect. And while there's opportunity for growth there, first and foremost, we want to protect that profit pool. I think the question referenced to a dedicated team. We've always had a team focused on that category. But over the last year, we've also added some specific product teams there so that they can continue to make focused improvements in the experience and also drive new product introduction that's targeted at that customer segment. We've talked at our Investor Day about just the pace of new product introduction overall starting to increase. And many of those products are relevant for consumer use cases as well. They just need different content or different merchandising like in drinkware or apparel. So the category will benefit from overall new product introduction will also benefit from overall experience improvements on the site. And as noted in our prior remarks, we're seeing that happen, and that will benefit consumers as well. Many of the new products that we've launched, especially in the photo products, home decor, some of our apparel gifts are showing nice growth. Although in Q1, our consumer overall was basically flat year-over-year. We do expect that from an overall perspective in the December quarter that consumer will still put some pressure on the Vista growth rate, as we mentioned back in Investor Day. But there's a lot of improvements that we've been able to make over the last year. So, the team has done a really nice job there in the planning, just had a review the other day on all that work and the client for the peak season basically starts now. So, while consumer it's not our primary focus from a brand perspective, it is still really important. And frankly, we're also uniquely equipped to serve customers across both small business categories and consumer categories. And when we look at the customer -- our customer value metrics, those hybrid customers, small business and consumer are very valuable for us. There's a lot of creative that we've used in our mid and upper funnel channels that we're repositioning this time of year to be relevant for consumer again. And that just like we were doing for all of our brand advertising is really trying to demonstrate the breadth of the product offering. And so you should see that over the next few weeks and months here through the holiday season. So, we feel good about our plans. We've made a lot of improvements, and we're excited about the weeks ahead here.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks Sean. All right. Robert, a question for you. Have you seen any signs of prices softening in any of your end markets?\nRobert Keane: No, nothing broad-based. All of our businesses are constantly testing pricing. So, there are some places where prices decreased there are also areas where they went up. So, I'd say no, this is normal in the course of testing and optimizing at this point. All right.\nMeredith Burns: Thank you. All right Sean, to give the market increased confidence in achieving a 2024 EBITDA guidance, are there any KPIs that you'd be willing to share?\nSean Quinn: Yes, sure. Well, I'm not sure what well KPIs would be helpful in that regard. Hopefully, even throughout the call so far, there's been more granularity provided that is helpful and provides confidence. We don't normally give such specific guidance like we have in the last quarters. But back in the March quarter, we provided guidance, which we beat and then we raised the expectation for the June quarter, we exceeded that, and we increased our guidance for FY 2024. And we just delivered strong Q1 EBITDA results, also cash flow results and increase our guidance for the full year. So, again, hopefully, you should get confidence from that as well. But I think it's not KPIs, but here's the math that I would focus on in terms of confidence in the full year guidance. As I said in my opening remarks, as of September, we have $383 million of FY 2024 adjusted EBITDA. I said in a response to an earlier question that we're on track with the cost reductions that we previously outlined. So if you do the math on that, those cost reductions, we said $75 million of benefit in FY 2024, roughly ratably over the first three quarters. So, there's still $50 million to come a benefit that will come into the run rate over the next two quarters. And then we said that we have currency headwinds this year of about $20 million for the year. $3.5 million of that was in Q1. So there's $16.5 million left to go there. So, if you just add all that up, you need to -- we need to deliver just under $10 million of the EBITDA expansion over the remaining three quarters of the year from the flow-through of growth to get to at least $425 million. That's not KPIs. But basically, in order to be confident in our guidance, you need to believe that we can deliver just under $10 million of improvement outside of cost reductions that we announced in March and outside of currency impact, whether that be from growth, efficiency, so on. We remain confident. Obviously, that should -- hopefully, that's understood from the fact that we increased our guidance. But that's the math that I would do to get comfortable.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you. So a couple of other questions here. One of which was pre-submitted and one of which came in live. Sean, can you walk us through the puts and takes of the FY 2024 guide, which calls for at least 8% year-over-year reported growth and 6% year-over-year FX-neutral growth and what is baked into the guide in terms of the macro? And another revenue question, I still don't understand how you get to 6% constant currency revenue growth for the full year if 1Q was 4%, and you're seeing Q2 was a tough comp. 2H, you'd have to have -- there's some math here. You have to have 16% constant currency comp in Q3 and 9% comp in Q4, what am I missing, raising EBITDA guidance by $5 million is great, but did 1Q outperform more than $5 million? Were there any pushouts of expenses from 1Q into the rest of the year?\nSean Quinn: Okay. A lot there. Let me try and cover all that. So, just in terms of puts and takes, the first question and influence the macro. I walk through that bridge to get to our EBITDA guidance just now. And then the cash flow guidance just flows from that because it's -- we're talking about cash flow conversion off of that EBITDA. From a macro perspective, we don't make specific predictions and frankly, we don't have any better ability to forecast macro than people on this call. And so the way that I would think about it in terms of the puts and takes in the FY 2024 guide and also the macro. I think it's helpful if you actually start from the bottom of the P&L and work your way upwards. And starting with OpEx after the cost reductions and the focusing of investment that we did last year. We feel good about our OpEx levels. Those are well under control and will continue to be managed very closely. From an advertising spend perspective, there, we made some decisions around focus last year as well. We continue to experiment there. Those decisions are all within our control. So, we feel good about that. From a cost of goods sold perspective, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question as well, input cost environment is improving. We do expect to experience those improved levels for the remainder of the year. So we feel good about that as well. And then it comes down to revenue and that's frankly where I'd say we attempt to be appropriately realistic about the environment that we're in. But of course, there's always macro risk to some extent. In terms of all the math to get back to 6% constant currency growth. The question is referring to what we'll be comping through the rest of the year. And yes, we do expect there to be some pressure on Vista growth from consumer. We've talked about that. There's nothing new in the December quarter. But other than that, I'm not going to walk through quarter-by-quarter revenue guidance or by segment. But we feel comfortable that we can still get to that level. Keep in mind also that there are some of these timing impacts in Q1 as well. And more than half of that will flip into revenue over the rest of the year. So that helps. And then as we get to -- towards the back end of the year, and it actually becomes an easier comp in parts of our business, and so that will influence growth rate in parts of our business as well. So listen, I think overall, is there a risk? There always is because there's always uncertainties from a macro perspective. But we've tried to be realistic about our expectations. Hopefully, the way that we've performed over recent quarters as we've given this guidance also kind of shows that that's how we're acting and we're trying to be realistic. Things can change, but we're going to try to be realistic, and we'll keep everyone updated on how we're doing against those expectations.\nMeredith Burns: Thanks Sean. All right. A question on Vista profitability. With Vista, adjusted EBITDA margins coming in at 19% for the quarter. How should we think about the potential upside to your previously provided color at Investor Day, which calls for 16% to 18% margins in FY 2024?\nSean Quinn: Yes. The Q1 results position us well within the context of that range that we talked about. I think the one variable, just to keep in mind there is advertising spend as a percentage of revenue was at the low end of the range that we had provided in terms of annual spend. I think it was a little bit under 15%, 14.5% or so. And so that's one variable just to take into account from a margin perspective. We do expect that will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. But yes, I think the Q1 results position us well within the context of that range.\nMeredith Burns: Thank you. All right. Question for you, Robert. What percentage of annual revenue or EBITDA is from business cards only, excluding stationery and everything else, just business cards. Not much of the market still thinks impress as things of Cimpress as the business card company. I know it's been decreasing. And I hope that the asker knows that, that's as a percentage of revenue. So, I believe it's helpful to disclose that. It's literally the first question I get when I bring up Cimpress.\nRobert Keane: Okay. Well, thanks for the question. First of all, let me be very clear. Variable gross profit, gross profit and contribution profit after advertising of business cards are all up in absolute dollars versus FY 2018 before we started this whole transformation of Vista. They were all-time highs in fiscal 2023, and they were Q1 historical highs this quarter. And it's very close to that from a revenue perspective. There's some differences there. And I realize that the Investor Day, we gave a category that included stationary. But if you looked at just business cards, what I just said is true. So, business cards revenue and business, our gross profit continue to grow in absolute dollar amounts that's true FY 2023 versus FY 2022, it's true this past quarter versus the first quarter of FY 2023. Now, the growth is in low single digits each year, and we think it's going to continue like that. But we also recognize it's a market which is declining overall, but we're taking share. Now, for many years, we spent a lot of advertising reinforcing Vistaprint, not Cimpress is print as a discount business company. So that was a perception, and we have moved way with that over the last multiple years. And so we still get some of that perception in the universe of investors. But although we don't disclose, in fact, we don't even calculate EBITDA by product, which was a question, I think, we do calculate the gross profit numbers and variable contribution profit I just described. And now couple of more thoughts on this. inside Cimpress, obviously, Visa has the most significant revenue gross profit from business cards. But we do see them -- they're about 25% plus or minus of revenue base, as I mentioned, other than during the pandemic, which they did fall, but they have consistently grown. Why are they growing? I think one, people are using them in new -- our customers are using them in new use cases. QR codes are becoming very popular, which it's a very easy way to get someone to your website or your digital presence. We have greatly increased the quality and the depth and breadth of our business card offering in terms of all the variations. And we're finding that customers are buying much smaller volumes of business cards, but at much higher end products, which is leading to both order and value growth. And because we're selling it at higher price points and higher gross profits than our traditional lead products, if you think of a very traditional Vistaprint approach 5, 10 years ago, it was 250 or 500 basic business cards with constant deep discounting often a $10 or $9.99 business cards for 50% off. We've moved away from that. So, I'd also say that some of these questions that investors have asked me come from a corporate setting. And I think it's a different way people operate in a corporate setting versus a small business, we could use it again for loyalty cards in a store. It's a box insert for small e-commerce or other product sellers. I mentioned QR codes. And so the trends are very different. Overall, other businesses have far less revenue from the business cards National Pen and builds basically nothing in Upload and Print, it's closer to 5%.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you, Robert. Robert, I'll stick with you for the next question, which is about the Wix partnership. How do you think about digital offerings contribution to the business throughout the course of the year? And where do you think it can grow over the medium term?\nRobert Keane: Okay. I'm pretty sure your question is about financial contribution, but I just want to give the context of value proposition contribution. I just mentioned QR codes, we recognize, of course, in this world, the physical digital connection of small business brands is important and in mid-larger businesses. So having the Wix partnership at Vista is very important to be relevant in that world because design and marketing activities very much transcend that physical digital divide. Or increasingly are removing that device. Now financially, we think we have an opportunity to grow in the Wix partnership because we're now fully migrated off of our legacy product we have in Zero. We're focused on optimizing the experience of the Wix product, which is an excellent product for customers in the small business space. And we think we're offering our customers a product. They like more, but importantly, the retention is strong in customer cash flows for us even after split the split we do with Wix are better. And we're looking at very successful increases in retention rates. So, again -- so far, the transition has been the focus off of the old product we have. Now, that it's done, the team that's working on this is shifting their focus to building from here. These are very valuable customers for us. The product is very relevant in today's world, and we're optimistic.\nMeredith Burns: Thank you, Robert. All right. Let's shift to Sean. Can you remind us of our software capitalization policy? I love it. Do you expect capitalized software to remain at current levels or moderate given the Vista re-platforming is behind us? And if a moderation is expected, would those outflows no longer be incurred or would they shift back into the income statement?\nRobert Keane: Yes. We expect capitalized software to be either flat or slightly lower this year than it was last year. Last year's level was $58 million. And that's -- last year's level was down from FY 2022, which was a high of $65 million. From the -- in terms of the income statement part of the question, if you're asking about the GAAP income statement, the costs that we capitalize get amortized into the P&L over three years. And so that reduction in the capitalized software levels from what was that high of $65 million in FY 2022, down to what will be approximately the same as last year, probably a little bit lower to $58 million. That difference will benefit the P&L over time because the amortization happens over time. So that founds a little delayed. My guess is that the question might be trying to get at whether that reduction effectively would reduce our EBITDA because the cost of those team members is just no longer capitalizable, or is there a true reduction and that won't have any impact on EBITDA. And the answer there is that the reduction from those FY 2022 levels is primarily due to the cost reductions that we did in FY 2023, which did focus where we're investing, but also did take advantage of areas where we could make changes post re-platforming. And so you shouldn't expect the cases that are here at swing back as to EBITDA.\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you. All right. So, we've had a live question here. And I think Robert or Sean will do a great job answering it. How are you leveraging technology data and AI and Gene learning to improve customer experiences and drive growth across your lines of business?\nRobert Keane: Yes. So, one, we're doing a lot. I'll give a few examples now. I'd really encourage you to go to our most recent Investor Day, it's all online at our IR site where both the slides. But if you look at the script or watch the video, you really get a good sense in much more detail that I can go into today. But let me just touch a few points. Data is very important. Martin, our CTO at the group level, [Indiscernible] at the Vista level and you spoke about technology and data in a great extent. We have literally millions of enrichment where we improve the quality of data at our customers and over 80 billion specific events that happen in upload and order payment, et cetera, which all goes into our data systems. We use machine learning in many different areas. We started at three, four, five years ago in early examples of how do you make graphic uploads higher resolution, how do you do background knockouts over time that's gotten much broader than what we were doing back in FY 2020. And today, we're doing things like having insights into the designs. Our customers are uploading AR-powered ten-fleet galleries, the AI information or capabilities we have behind things like logo maker are all based to getting machine learning. We're moving into generative AI work for suggesting graphic design improvements, design quality insurance, customer service and a lot of other ways. So, again, that's a brief and rapid list of some of the things we're doing. I'd encourage you to look at our Investor Day to get more detail.\nMeredith Burns: Fantastic. Thank you, Robert. All right. We have one more question that is on capital allocation. So, Sean, get ready, would you consider buying back term loan B seeing that the total interest on TLB is higher than the bonds, which are 7% fixed? We had a couple of questions like that.\nSean Quinn: Sure. And we've had a couple of questions like this in recent quarters. So the answer will be very consistent with what we've said in recent quarters. As of -- at the end of September, the weighted average interest rate on our term loan B that was just under 8%, 7.9%, inclusive of swaps. And so the non-hedged portion of that was higher. So, yes, the current rates are higher for our term loans, which were at variable rate, and that's higher than the 7% coupon on our bonds. But our bonds were trading at a deeper discount our loans. So, when you look at the yield, the yield has been much higher for bond repurchases. That was the case in Q1. To put that in perspective, during the window that we were buying in Q1, our bonds traded between 93% and 94%, and our average purchase price was 93.6% or so. And the U.S. dollar tranche of our term loan B traded closer to part. So that discount was not there. The yield to maturity on our bond repurchases in Q1 averaged a little bit under 10%. Although if you assume that we refinance our bonds in advance of the maturity, then the actual yield goes up from there. The bonds also mature two years before the term will be. So, we take term into account when we're trying to make these decisions as well. It's not out of the question that we would buy term loan B, but these are some of the factors that we consider, most notably yield and term. There are some others too. And so we'll continue to look at that and also the direction of interest rates, which obviously is an important input to this.\nMeredith Burns: Thank you, Sean. All right. That brings us to the end of our questions and I'm going to hand things over to Robert to wrap-up.\nRobert Keane: Okay. Thank you, Meredith. Thank you to all the investors for joining the call and continuing to entrust your capital with us. We look forward to delivering during this second quarter, which is our holiday peak as well as the rest of the fiscal year. We're off to a very good start. We're excited to be leveraging a stronger set of tools and capabilities to deliver great customer experiences stronger really than we've had in years. We are also financially excited to continue on the path to grow our profit and cash flow, very much in line with what we've been speaking about for the last year and to continue as we do so, nonetheless, to invest in the development of new capabilities, new customer value propositions that will continue to build our intrinsic value per share. Thank you again for your time, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
