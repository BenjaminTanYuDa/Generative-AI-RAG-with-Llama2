        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining the PetMed Express Third Quarter Preliminary Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Shamali, the operator for today's call. I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Mr. Brian Prenoveau, Investor Relations.\nBrian Prenoveau: Thank you, operator and I'd like to welcome everybody here today to the PetMed Express fiscal third quarter preliminary financial results conference call. Certain information that will be included during this call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended that may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions we have used based upon information currently available to us. Because these statements reflect our current views concerning future events, these statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. There can be no assurance that any forward-looking results will occur or be realized and nothing contained in this presentation is or should be relied upon as a representation or a warranty as to any future matter, including any matter in respect of the operations or business or financial condition of PetMeds. PetMeds undertakes no obligation to update publicly these forward-looking statements based on subsequent events, except as may be required by applicable law, regulation or other competent legal authority. We have identified various risk factors associated with our operations in our most recent annual report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, let me introduce our CEO and President, Matt Hulett. Matt?\nMatt Hulett: Thank you, Brian. Thank you to everyone for making the time today to participate in today's conference call. Today's call will follow a slightly different format than recent calls. As many of today's listeners likely saw, this afternoon, we filed an 8-K and issued a press release announcing a planned restatement of certain previously issued financial statements due to errors in accounting for certain tax-related matters. Please reference those documents for additional information regarding those factors that may affect the restatement of our financial statements. Additionally, due to the administrative burden and the process required for a multiyear restatement, our 10-Q for fiscal year 2024's third quarter ended December 31, 2023, will be delayed. The restatement and the delay in this quarter's 10-Q filing are due to errors in the accounting treatment related to certain previously reported tax-related items. As you recall, our Chief Financial Officer, Christine Chambers, first discussed the identification of the need for a sales tax accrual in the second fiscal quarter of last year and provided an update on the fiscal fourth quarter call. The restatement pertains in part to the recording of the sales tax accrual. I want to stress a few things. Number one, we are working together with all of our relevant partners and consultants to finalize the accounting treatment and complete the restatement as quickly as possible. Number two, the restatement has no impact on our day-to-day business operations or on our strategy. And number three, the restatement is a matter of accounting for tax-related items and there is no impact on our current cash balance. Christine will be discussing this accounting issue in more detail during her portion of the call. We would like to spend the remainder of the time on today's call discussing progress made in the business and sharing some high-level specifics from the fiscal third quarter. For the quarter ending December 31, 2023, PetMeds delivered sales of $65.3 million compared to sales of $58.9 million in the prior year, an increase of 11% year-over-year, including from our recent acquisition of PetCareRx. We reported a gross margin of 27.4% which was in line with our expectations. This reflects a balance between promotional activities intended to introduce food to our customers and a regimented focus on maintaining our historical gross margin as an overall business. Returning customers accounted for sales of $57.7 million during the quarter, reflecting a growth of 8% year-over-year related to the addition of the PetCareRx business. In terms of our initiatives to offer more products and provide more value to our existing pet parent customers, we've focused intensely on raising awareness about our food catalog at both the category and brand levels. Additionally, we are enhancing our cross-sell initiatives through our e-mail CRM, call center and website. Along those lines, we are excited to announce the addition of another major food brand of PetMeds in the coming months. We have entered into a partnership with Hill's Pet Nutrition and are launching Hill's Science Diet this quarter, a premium category known for its tailor-made nutrition that promotes healthy skin, coat and immune system in pets. Hill's Science Diet will start to roll out as early as next month. Premium food brands are important relationships for PetMeds and this expansion was accelerated in part due to our acquisition of PetCareRx. Prescription and premium food are important categories for PetMed as our pet parents are very health and wellness focused. Simply put, our customers want premium food and prescription food options. And we'll be leaning in heavily on this brand as well as new ones as we continue to go to market in the pet food category. We believe these additional food options provide us the ability to interact with our customers more often, increase the average order size and enhance the lifetime value of each customer. Let's turn to our operational advancements and initiatives. We have talked about our key performance indicators for the transformation of the business: successfully providing more product offerings to our current customers, increasing our recurring customer base and driving recurring revenues. A key business model driver for the PetMeds business is to expand the number and types of products our core prescription customer base buys from us or will buy from us on a recurring basis. We believe that our new AutoShip platform which was recently launched, will help facilitate the long-term compounded benefit and expanded customer loyalty by delivering exceptional value. This new AutoShip & Save capability enhances our current capabilities to include more pet parent control over their ordering experience, including activities like controlling the subscription duration, pausing or accelerating a subscription and adding additional products. We have also integrated our VetLive functionality which connects pet parents to licensed veterinarians over a digital connection 24/7 which is now available for all of our AutoShip & Save customers on a complementary basis. We believe the more products that pet parent uses on our AutoShip program, the more loyal they become. Our AutoShip & Save and PetPlus programs grew to 52% of our revenue during this last fiscal quarter, a substantial increase from 42% of revenue for the same time last year. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Christine Chambers, to provide an overview of the quarter's financials.\nChristine Chambers: Thanks, Matt. I want to first address the restatement announced in the 8-K earlier this afternoon and then I will address selected preliminary third quarter results for fiscal year 2024. In our previously issued annual financial statements for fiscal year 2023, we determined that an accrual for sales tax was required, so we recorded a sales tax accrual in the period based on a determination that the sales tax liability was probable and estimable and that it was in accordance with what we believe to be the appropriate guidance from GAAP. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the company reviewed, in conjunction with our auditors, RSM, the accounting treatment related to the previously reported sales tax accruals as well as the accounting treatment related to the deferred tax asset associated with the company's acquisition of PetCareRx in April 2023. As a result of the review, the Audit Committee of our Board has concluded, based on management's determination, that the company misapplied GAAP as it relates to the sales tax liability for prior periods included in the second quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the deferred tax asset reported in the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The company expects the impact of the restatement to affect multiple periods. The most significant impact to the income statement is expected to be a decrease in general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2023 in the range of $6 million to $8 million and the corresponding increase in net income for the same period. This amount was originally recorded as a sales tax liability based on a probable and estimable approach in fiscal year 2023 rather than the correct legal liability approach, under which the maximum potential sales liability would have been recorded beginning in fiscal year 2020. The restatement is expected to require the company to revise and record a sales tax liability of approximately $14 million to $20 million as of March 31, 2020. Because this liability gets adjusted in subsequent periods, as of March 31, 2023, we expect to record a maximum potential sales tax liability of approximately $16 million to $23 million. In addition, the accounting related to the valuation of the carried forward net operating loss resulting in an overstated deferred tax asset reported at June 30 and September 30, 2023, related to the PetCareRx acquisition will also be revised. This will increase goodwill and decrease the deferred tax asset on the balance sheet. This revision is the result of a technical tax matter surrounding a limitation adjustment to the net operating losses acquired. The company believes that this fairly represents the expected impact of the restatement on the company's prior financial statements. However, further adjustments may arise. It is important to note that, while unfortunate, the restatement is not expected to have an impact on the company's fiscal year 2024 revenue or cost of sales sold and does not impact our current cash balance. The restatement is not expected to impact our day-to-day business operations or strategic priorities. As a result of the level of administrative effort and time associated with completing the restatement, the company will experience a delay in the filing of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and expects to file a notification of late filing with the SEC. To reiterate, this quarter, due to the restatement process, we cannot comment on numbers below the gross profit line as the restatement could potentially impact G&A. Today, I will report our selected preliminary third quarter fiscal 2024 results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. As a reminder, this will be the third quarter of combined results including the acquisition of PetCareRx compared to results for PetMeds only for fiscal year 2023. Third quarter sales was $65.3 million, compared to sales of $58.9 million in the same period last year, representing growth of 11% year-over-year. The growth was due to incremental sales from the acquisition of PetCareRx partially offset by declines in PetMeds legacy new order and reorder sales. We continue to experience a single-digit decline in PetMeds legacy reorder sales. We welcomed approximately 67,000 new pet parents this quarter compared to nearly 72,000 in the prior year. The decline year-over-year is primarily due to onetime promotions in the same period last year that we tested and intentionally did not repeat as they did not attract high order value customers. Reorder sales were $57.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 8% compared to reorder sales of $53.3 million in the same period last year. We've continued to grow our recurring revenue, including AutoShip & Save sales and PetCareRx membership sales as a percentage of total sales. This drives greater engagement and strengthens our recurring sales base. Recurring sales as a percentage of total sales was 52% in the quarter, up sequentially from 51% in the prior quarter and up from 42% for the same period last year. Gross profit for the quarter as a percentage of sales was 27.4% compared to 25.9% in the same quarter last year and 28.3% in the prior quarter. The increase year-over-year was due to lower promotions compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $49.4 million of cash and equivalents on hand and no debt. Now, I will turn the call back to Matt for some concluding remarks.\nMatt Hulett: Thanks, Christine. As the CEO of this company, I've always promised to lead with full transparency. Providing financial statements that can be relied upon is fundamental and paramount to running a public company. In an effort to provide complete and accurate financial statements, we've recorded an additional sales tax accrual during fiscal 2023 and, unfortunately, later determined that GAAP was misapplied in doing so. Despite having to correct this, I want to reiterate that our focus remains on operating the business and on executing our strategy. Our pet health care strategy revolves around 4 key pillars: medication, care, nutrition and wellness. PetMeds is focused on executing our initiatives to operate a broader range of products and services to our core PetMeds customer base on a recurring basis. The announcement of adding a new premium food brand, along with a major upgrade to our AutoShip & Save infrastructure represent significant milestones in the journey to transform PetMeds into a trusted pet health expert. This will deliver more value to new pet parents as well as our existing 2 million customers. With these statements, we conclude our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we are now prepared to take questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Meyers with Lake Street Capital Markets.\nRyan Meyers: First one for me, just a couple on the actual restatement itself. Can you just discuss or explain what actually happened with the sales tax accrual and essentially how this error happened?\nChristine Chambers: Ryan, it's Christine and I'm glad you asked the question, thank you. There are 3 really important things that need to be taken away. And first thing I'll start with is this is the same issue that I identified and discussed last year related to our historical, these are prior period sales tax and exposure related to that. The difference is surrounded by the accounting treatment. So just to reiterate, this is not the result of any new facts or new analysis. It's about the accounting treatment. So secondly, let me just talk about the accounting treatment. There are 2 different ways to account for prior period sales tax liabilities. You can apply ASC 450 which is based on, as I mentioned, this probable and estimable approach. The other way that you can look at this is by applying ASC 405 which is based on a legal liability approach. This adopts a more strict interpretation and it accrues -- what's important, this accrues to the maximum legal liability. Now we believe that 405 is better than 450. And again, when you're looking at ASC and you're look at accounting applications, they're often about judgment. Historically, there has been diversity of practice applied to this issue. But we just reiterated that we believe now 405 is applicable versus 450. Thirdly, the last thing I want you to -- yes. Just to reiterate as well just the third thing. Yes. While having to restate is really disappointing, we are, as Matt and I have mentioned, committed to operating with the highest standards of transparency and making sure that we provide transparency and integrity. And we proactively identified the issue late in the third quarter and have begun working with our partners immediately to resolve. So we're working on this as quickly as possible and we'll get more out as soon as we can.\nRyan Meyers: Got it. That's helpful. I understand. And then you talked previously the accrual would be originally estimated about $6 million to $8 million. Now it sounds like it's obviously going to be quite a bit more than that. Does that mean you guys will be paying much more in that sales tax once those accruals go through? Or how should we be thinking about the taxes once you're able to revise this issue?\nChristine Chambers: Yes. Thank you. Another great question. Again, no change, Ryan, to our approach or strategy in resolving sales tax issues with the states. We've demonstrated the history of most settlements with states and again, our analysis of what is probable and estimable has not changed. So no change to our tax strategy with resolving these sales tax matters, just an accounting change.\nRyan Meyers: Okay. Got it. And then just kind of switching gears here to the actual fundamentals of the business. Just wondering if you can comment on if you've seen further stabilization of the core PetMeds business or maybe a little bit more commentary on what you're seeing there.\nMatt Hulett: Yes. I can take that, Christine. Ryan, thanks for the question. Yes, I think in the call, you obviously noted that the returning core PetMeds customer base, we noted, is declining relatively at the same rate from previous quarters. And really, the big comment there, I would say, is the core returning base of customers to PetMeds and the answer that we've really been focused on as a company is getting more of our customers on the AutoShip because our AutoShip business is growing and those customers churn less; and then two, in parallel, upgrading that platform which I noted on the call. And I've mentioned this on several calls but just to add a little bit more color to that. The AutoShip & Save infrastructure was sitting on a very legacy old platform. We spent about a year getting ready to do 2 things: one, to adopt that order management system that enables us to really build brains around distributing products, interacting with drop shippers, interacting with different warehouses; and then also, an order subscription platform that enables the consumer as well as us as the back end to have a much more flexible system. The old system was not really what I'd call industrial grade. And we think that this new platform that we just released just several weeks ago is going to be a really good answer to stabilizing the returning customer base with PetMeds. We've noted in our AutoShip sales as a percent of overall sales around 50%. We'd like to be a lot higher than that. Our original goal was 50%. We know that other direct-to-consumer brands have a much higher percent. And we couldn't have done that unless we made this investment about a year ago to upgrade the system. So in a long-winded way, more customers on AutoShip buying more products from PetMeds, including food. And this AutoShip & Save platform, we think, is going to be a key future unlock to really stabilize that base because it's a much more stable platform.\nRyan Meyers: Got it. And then last question for me. Just wondering if you can comment on the food business. I know that's obviously a newer piece of the business. But any sort of contribution you guys saw there during the quarter or how we should think about that business is trending?\nMatt Hulett: Yes. Thanks for that. Well, the answer there is 2 parts. One is getting food brands signed that our customers want and I had a little bit of color on that. And then two is executing on getting more products that our customers want in the AutoShip program. So on the first part, we are currently expanding our relationships with many of the top prescription and premium food brands. We just announced that we'll be launching Hill's this quarter, Hill's Science Diet. And we'll be launching and announcing new deeper partnerships with these premium brands in the future. And that's a huge deal for our customers. Our customers are very health conscious. They go to the vet a lot. They want premium food and prescription products, given our prescription medication background. Getting those types of brands online is large because we know definitively how many of our customers use those brands. So that's the first unlock. Get the brand and get them signed. The second is executing on that. And we've seen a large growth in our food sales as a percentage of sales which is very low. It's our fastest-growing category. And so as we get better at go-to-market, as we get better at marketing the right brands to our customers, that should continue to be a really good trend for the business.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mathew Hulett for closing remarks.\nMatt Hulett: Yes. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Although it was unfortunate news today regarding the tax liability issues and the accounting change, we hope that, that doesn't overshadow our excitement as a management team about the future of PetMeds as we transform from a single category pet medication business to a broader pet health expert business. We're excited about continuing to articulate our milestones along this journey. And thank you very much for your time and attention today. Thank you. Operator, we're all done here. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the PetMed Express Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shamali, the operator for today's call. I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Mr. Brian Prenoveau, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is now yours.\nBrian Prenoveau: Thank you, operator. I'd like to welcome everybody here today to the PetMed Express fiscal second quarter earnings call. I would also like to remind everyone that the first portion of this conference call will be listen-only until the question-and-answer session, which will be later in the call. Also, certain information that will be included during this call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions we have used based upon information currently available to us. Because these statements reflect our current views concerning future events, these statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. There can be no assurance that any forward-looking results will occur or be realized. And nothing contained in this presentation is or should be relied upon as a representation or warranty as to any future matter, including any matter in respect to the operations or business or financial condition of PetMeds. PetMeds undertakes no obligation to update publicly these forward-looking statements based on subsequent events, except as may be required by applicable law, regulation or other competent legal authority. We have identified various risk factors associated with our operations in our most recent annual report and other filings within the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, during the course of today's call, the Company will be discussing one or more non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the press release we issued this afternoon. Now let me introduce our CEO and President, Matt Hulett. Matt?\nMatt Hulett: Thank you, Brian. Thank you to everyone for making the time today to participate in our earnings call. For today's earnings call, I would like to focus my remarks on our operational advancements and overall progress. For the quarter ending September 30, 2023, PetMeds delivered sales of $71 million compared to sales of $65.4 million in the prior year, an increase of 9% year-over-year, reflecting our recent acquisition of PetCareRx. Our AutoShip & Save and Pet Plus programs grew to 51% of our revenue during this last fiscal quarter, a substantial increase from 39% of revenue for the same time last year. Later in the operating section, we will be discussing the significant improvements that we are making to the platform and program. This quarter delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in new customers. We added 75,600 new customers during the quarter, representing a 25% increase year-over-year. This growth includes new customers from the core PetMeds business as well as the contribution from the addition of PetCareRx's new customers. While we were excited about the sequential growth in new customers, we continue to face challenges with stabilizing the core PetMeds returning customer base. Returning customers accounted for sales of $62.4 million during the quarter, reflecting growth of 4.5% year-over-year. However, this growth was solely attributable to the addition of the PetCareRx business. While we do not break out our sales between the core PetMeds and PetCareRx brands, the returning PetMeds customer base is still declining at approximately the same single-digit rate from the previous quarter. And while this decline is less than it was a year ago, we have not yet achieved a stabilized returning customer base. Stabilizing the core returning customer base remains a top priority for us. We believe the combination of selling more consumable products to our existing customers and enhancing our recurring subscription platform offering is key to this challenge. As such, our immediate focus is on adding additional products to the basket, migrating more of our repeat business to our AutoShip & Save program and expanding on our operating initiatives currently underway to create deeper relationships with our returning base. Lastly, PetMeds is not immune to the overall market conditions. Based on our own data, the pet industry data, as well as discussions with our supplier partners, we have seen some softness in our core returning customer base in terms of reduced spending. PetMeds pioneered the direct-to-consumer pet prescription space over 27 years ago based on a value proposition, and we have a large base of price-conscious pet parents in our active customer base. We have also seen some specific categories and products in the prescription space that have come under pressure, contributing to the softness in our year-over-year numbers. While we feel that PetMeds' current mix being largely in the prescription health care business is more resilient to macroeconomic pressures, we are certainly not immune to them. We believe that our diversification into new consumable categories and our continued push into our core value positioning provide an opportunity to grow over the long term. Next slide, please. PetMeds is making strong progress on our strategy to evolve the business from our legacy as a prominent pet medication retailer to our future where pet parents recognize PetMeds as their most trusted pet health experts. Our pet health care strategy revolves around four key pillars: medication, care, nutrition and wellness. PetMeds is focused on integrating and executing on our newly acquired partnerships and assets to offer a broader range of products and services to our core PetMeds customer base on a recurring basis. Our suite of products and services is attractive because pet owners are increasingly gravitating towards brands that are deeply committed to the overall health and well-being of their pets. And we're proud to be that brand. We have been very clear as to the significant milestones that represent the key performance indicators for our transformation into a growth-oriented business. These indicators are providing more, bringing more products to our customers beyond our core medication business. In particular, expanding into food and other consumable nutrition products, which will help stabilize our core returning customer base, continued gains in recurring revenue, year-over-year increases in new customers, meeting and exceeding market growth rates for the entire PetMeds business. I would now like to highlight the key operational achievements from this last quarter. Under the strategic theme of expanding our product offerings beyond our core prescription business, PetMeds is poised to service a more dynamic and increasingly competitive market. I'm excited to announce significant improvements to our core infrastructure that will improve PetMeds' ability to support our expansion into a multi-category company, as well as expand our core subscription services to our pet parents. To add a bit more color, management has been working in parallel on upgrading the core e-commerce business systems while investing in new assets and capabilities to expand our relationship with our customers. We are currently rolling out enhancements to certain legacy systems that will enable the business to scale more quickly, delight customers and will unlock value for PetMeds. To provide even more detail, we are implementing a new modern order management system. This platform will allow us to more efficiently track sales, process orders, manage inventory, and streamline fulfillment across multiple distribution locations. While on the topic of technology investments and upgrades, during our last earnings call, we mentioned that we implemented a new e-mail and CRM platform. PetMeds now has the capability to personalize promotions and campaigns based on customer type within the PetMeds ecosystem, thus enabling us to begin expanding wallet share across the large base of PetMeds' primarily prescription-based customer base. For example, we can target different types of pet parents with specific offers and recommendations based on their unique wants and needs. These infrastructure upgrades will play a pivotal role as PetMeds returns to being a growth business. Growth in recurring subscription revenue is essential to our strategy, and these investments have enabled us to develop the second generation of our AutoShip & Save program. Now let's move on to what these investments mean for enabling PetMeds to have more recurring subscription revenue. Our new AutoShip & Save capability will enhance the current capabilities to include more pet parent control over their ordering experience, including activities like controlling the subscription duration, pausing a subscription, and changing the quantity of an order. We strongly believe that these changes will result in a greatly enhanced customer experience. In addition, we will soon make available an exciting new value-add capability. Specifically, this means that our VetLive functionality, which connects pet parents to licensed veterinarians over a digital connection 24/7, will be available for all of our AutoShip & Save customers on a complementary basis. We firmly believe that providing access to integrated expert services, in addition to expanding our product catalog, provides real differentiation in the pet market. We believe this differentiation really materializes when we integrate our capabilities into one integrated pet parent experience with virtual vet services, integrated insurance, and curated health and wellness products all in one place. I've already reported on our growth in net new customers. The area that I would like to highlight is that we see continued growth in the acquisition of new customers. PetMeds has historically had a very deep but limited product catalog specifically focused on the pet prescription space. Today and in the future, we are leaning into a broader product catalog to include more nutrition and wellness offerings that can address a greater share of pet parents' needs. In terms of meeting and exceeding industry growth rates, we firmly believe that adding more differentiation in the form of unique services like VetLive combined with a broader catalog of products outside of prescription medication, enables us to stabilize our returning pet parent base, attract and retain new customers, and to expand our overall sales. As mentioned, we are actively introducing premium and prescription food to our extensive base of over 2 million pet parents. This represents a huge opportunity to increase the basket size, which should lead to increases in lifetime value and overall retention of our customer base. Last quarter, we were excited to introduce the Purina product line, and now our Royal Canin retail line of products have been recently added to our growing pet food catalog. In addition, I'm excited to announce that we are now live with our pet insurance offering. As you may recall, our new insurance offering is powered by our partnership with a leading insurance company, Pumpkin Insurance, which is now majority owned by JAB Holdings. We envision that the introduction of our insurance product will be viewed as a valuable offering by our expansive community of over 2 million pet permits. As you can see, we've made substantial progress this past quarter. Now I'd like to hand the presentation over to Christine.\nChristine Chambers: Thanks, Matt. Today, I will report our Q2 fiscal 2024 results for the quarter ending September 30, 2023. As a reminder, this will be the second quarter of combined results including the acquisition of PetCareRx as compared to results for PetMeds only for Q2 fiscal 2023. Next slide, please. Second quarter sales were $71 million compared to sales of $65.4 million in the same period last year, growth of 9% year-over-year. This growth was due to the incremental sales from the acquisition of PetCareRx, increased PetMeds legacy new order sales, partially offset by declines in PetMeds' legacy reorder sales. As Matt previously mentioned, we continued our trend of net new customer growth year-over-year, both organically with growth in PetMeds' legacy new customer sales and inorganically with the combination of PetCareRx. However, we continued to experience a single-digit decline in PetMeds' legacy reorder sales. This decline was relatively flat to the decline in the prior quarter. We welcomed approximately 65,600 new pet parents this quarter compared to 60,700 in the prior year. This represents new customer growth of 25% year-over-year and reflects both organic and inorganic growth. In addition, reorder sales of $62.2 million for the quarter increased 4.5% compared to the reorder sales of $59.7 million in the same period last year. The growth can be attributed to the acquisition of PetCareRx, partially offset by declines in PetMeds' legacy reorder sales. With the acquisition of PetCareRx, we also added $2.4 million of revenue associated with our PetCareRx membership programs. We've continued to grow our recurring revenue, including AutoShip & Save sales and PetCareRx membership sales as a percentage of total sales. This drives greater engagement and strengthens our recurring sales base. As Matt mentioned, recurring sales as a percentage of total sales was 51% in the quarter, up sequentially from 49% in the prior quarter and up from 39% for the same period last year. Gross profit for the quarter as a percentage of sales was 28.3%, compared to 28.2% in the same quarter last year and 28.8% in the prior quarter. G&A increased $2.5 million year-over-year, in part due to the combination of PetCareRx as well as strategic investments in PetMeds' legacy third-party expenses, offset by non-recurring G&A expenses in the prior year. Net loss for the second quarter was $70,000 or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.2 million, compared to $7.1 million in the same quarter last year. Increased gross profit of $1.6 million was offset by an increase in operating expenses, in part due to the combination of PetCareRx, as well as strategic investments in PetMeds' legacy third-party expenses and net advertising expenses. Turning to Slide 7, we ended the quarter with $53.5 million of cash on our balance sheet and no debt. As we do each quarter, we evaluate our capital allocation policy. This quarter, we carefully considered our current financial position and our financial needs with the commitment to allocate capital in a manner that will best position PetMeds for sustainable long-term growth and enhanced value. With those factors in mind, today we are announcing that we will be suspending our dividend payment effective the quarter ending September 30, 2023. The suspension of the dividend will allow us to strategically invest in our core business, including investing in infrastructure that will enable us to ramp up our technology capabilities, enhance our marketing efforts, and offer competitive and innovative solutions to our customers, as well as to invest in growth opportunities. In turn, this will enable us to build recurring revenue through a growing customer base. And for the balance of the year, we will continue to focus efforts on setting up the expanded product catalog to drive future organic growth. Maximizing shareholder value over the long term is a key priority, which requires fiscal discipline and prudent capital allocation. We will continue to balance the need for capital to fuel growth opportunities with the opportunity to return capital to shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Matt for some concluding remarks prior to Q&A.\nMatt Hulett: In summary, PetMeds is in an important and promising phase of growth and transformation. We're not just a single category pet prescription business anymore. We're evolving into a comprehensive pet health brand. Four pillars anchor this vision: medication, care, nutrition and wellness. Our focus on newly acquired partnerships and assets that allows us to offer a wider product range and recurring services to our core customer base, reinforcing us as the brand deeply committed to overall pet wellness. We are about to deploy our new infrastructure with new order management platform improvements and upgraded AutoShip & Save program and added features like VetLive and integrated insurance to offer an unmatched pet parent experience. Plus our expanded product catalog with top-tier brands like Purina and Royal Canin promises even more growth. We are confident that these investments culminate in increasing the overall value that we provide to our customers. More frequent recurring interactions, combined with a broader set of products and services will equate to a more stabilized core PetMeds business, as well as offer a platform for new growth. We're thrilled about the strides we've made and even more excited for what's ahead. This transformation isn't just good for us. It's great for our over 2 million pet parents and their fur babies. With these statements, we conclude our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we are now prepared to take questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Meyers with Lake Street Capital.\nRyan Meyers: First one for me. I wonder if you could just provide us with a little bit of commentary on what new customer spend looks like relative to legacy customers as you guys call it. Just want to kind of get an understanding if we're starting to see some of this cross-selling take place. I know you just added Purina, you talked about Royal Canin. Just want to try to get a good understanding as far as these new customers that are coming on to the platform. Are they starting to purchase adjacent products? Just trying to get a good understanding there would be helpful.\nMatt Hulett: I can take that one, Ryan. Thanks for the question. Yes, just a couple of things to unpack from your question. One is really our food go-to-market in terms of introducing food at scale to our overall base really just started this quarter, and that includes awareness campaigns in our packaging, e-mails, customized offers. And that's kind of statement one. Statement two, really, we do see the introduction of food starting to take hold for new customers since those customers are targeted primarily on AutoShip offers, we have the opportunity to attach food when we have that first initial transaction with those customers. So, we are seeing some traction with new customers. And then for returning customers as we start positioning ourselves as a broader pet health expert, it's going to take some time to get the awareness up that we're a brand that introduces something other than prescription medication. But we're really excited about some of the early signals that we've seen.\nRyan Meyers: Got it. That's helpful. And then now with the dividend gone, what's your guys' number one priority here as far as capital allocation goes forward? And where do you think, now that you don't have to pay that dividend, you can put some more money back in the business? It would be helpful to understand that.\nChristine Chambers: Yes. Ryan, thanks so much for the question. So as you know, we fundamentally believe in the continued growth in the pet e-commerce sector and reallocating capital will give us this financial flexibility to really aggressively pursue opportunities in this space. So, we believe that the reinvestment will provide returns to our shareholders in the long term. And as you know, we're really in the midst of implementing this comprehensive growth strategy that will give us the opportunity to invest in those technological advancements, product diversification, and really take advantage of this growing e-commerce market. We also want to ensure that we have the cash for working capital, to ensure, as we scale and grow, that we can run smoothly, and we have the CapEx options that will help fuel growth.\nOperator: And our questions and answers portion of the call has ended. I would now like to turn the call back to Matt Hulett, the Company's CEO, for his concluding remarks.\nA - Matt Hulett: Thank you for joining our call today. I'm confident that the future we envision for PetMed, along with the foundation that we've been laying, will meet the market opportunity in unique and innovative ways and will lead to increased operating results and shareholder value. PetMed's brand, expertise and reputation are unparalleled. We have greatly accelerated our operating road map. And we look forward to sharing our progress as we go to market with products and services that positively change the lives of our pet parents and pets. Thank you for your continued support.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Now, let me introduce our CEO and President, Matt Hulett. Matt?\nMatt Hulett: Thank you, Brian. Thank you for making the time today to participate in our earnings call. We're looking forward to sharing our operational advancements and financial achievements with the investment and analysts' community. First, we will provide an overview of our business progress since our last update on May 18, 2023. This will offer insights into the significant developments and milestones achieved during this period. Second, we will provide a summary of our quarterly financial results, including a detailed analysis of our financial performance.  PetMed is a company that delivers prescription and non-prescription medications, food, supplements, supplies and vet services direct to the consumer. Our expert online pharmacy is an established and trusted brand as evidenced by the fact that we have served more than 11 million pet parents over our company's 27-year operating history. While we have a loyal customer base of pet parents who value our brand, service and quality, we believe our company and this industry can provide even more to the millions of pet parents across the country. As such, our goal is to be the market leader in pet wellness and healthcare, or as we like to say the trusted pet health experts because we believe every pet deserves to live a long, happy, healthy life.  Next slide, please. Since April, we have been fully engaged in integrating our latest acquisition, PetCareRx into the PetMed’s family, a significant milestone for our organization. This acquisition presents a compelling opportunity for us to expand our product catalogue and capitalize on the many synergies between PetCareRx and PetMed. By leveraging the PetCareRx catalogue, we can offer a broader range of products to our PetMed customer base. This strategic move aligns with our core investment thesis and positions us for further growth and success.  Since its inception, PetMed has focused primarily on pet medication refills and PetCareRx accelerates our plan to improve the legacy PetMed business. Our aim is to enhance our merchandising capabilities and expand our product offerings with a particular emphasis on consumables while continuing to leverage our core expertise in pet medication. This evolution will meet the broader needs of our customers and will strengthen our market position as a comprehensive pet care provider. So far, our efforts are yielding encouraging results.  Since completing the acquisition, we have undertaken a thorough data optimization process ensuring that our AI-based site recommendation engine is fully optimized to suggest relevant non-prescription products to our customers. Furthermore, we've enhanced the site experience for our valued returning customers, encouraging them to purchase additional products, personalized to their individual pet's needs. In addition, our newly designed checkout process provides a seamless and convenient experience, further bolstering customer satisfaction and loyalty.  In line with our commitment to providing services from nose to tail, we have begun integrating the PetCareRx catalogue into our operations, including our distribution facilities. As part of the PetCareRx product integration, we now offer the complete food line of Purina products, including its prescription food line. Purina is one of the largest pet food product companies in the world. The Purina product line ranks in the top 10 best selling brands for PetCareRx. And by integrating the PetCareRx product offering, we have extended this world-class brand to our PetMed offering for pet parents.  Purina’s focus on pet health and providing options that help with pet allergies, weight management, joint health, and immune support, among other targeted health benefits, align so well with our goal to be the market leader in pet wellness and healthcare. We will start to see other benefits from the unification of PetMed and PetCareRx. As an example, we have started to leverage our combined buying power and believe we will be able to deliver at lower cost to our customers on a per unit basis.  Operationally, we have spent considerable time and focus on upgrading internal systems and controls. We completed the migration of our legacy email system to a modern cutting edge platform. This transformation unlocks new marketing capabilities, enabling us to engage with our customer base more effectively. Through targeted and personalized communication, we will be able to provide better product and service recommendations. We believe that with the combined purchasing power, coupled with our meticulous identification and execution of cost synergies, we are well on track to deliver on our objective of PetCareRx becoming adjusted EBITDA accretive before the end of our fiscal year. This achievement underscores our commitment to creating value for our shareholders and maximizing the potential of this strategic acquisition.  Next slide, please. As we mentioned on previous earnings calls over the last year, PetMed has been in a rebuilding mode. The strategic transformation that we charted, encompassing both organic and inorganic investments, is aimed at positioning PetMed for long-term success, enhancing our operational capabilities, expanding our product portfolio, and ultimately creating sustainable value for our shareholders. Today's call marks a slightly different tone from previous calls. PetMed has undergone rapid changes over the past two years, and we firmly believe in the path we have chosen as a premium specialty retailer brand.  We have been deliberate in the execution of our strategy as well as in the consistency and transparency of our external communication to ensure that our stakeholders are well informed about the essential criteria that serve as performance indicators for our transformation into a growth-oriented business. These indicators are: year-over-year increases in new customers, continued gains in recurring revenue, more product and service diversification beyond our four medication expertise, meeting and exceeding market growth rates for the entire PetMed business. These performance indicators serve to guide us as we navigate our journey towards becoming a thriving growth focus company.  I am thrilled to share the exciting news that this quarter signifies a reacceleration in our company's trajectory, including early signs of promise in our ongoing business transformation. It is important to note that a business transformation is an ever evolving process, particularly in the early stages. However, today, I am delighted to announce that we have successfully positioned ourselves as a growth business, meeting the four key performance indicators as previously outlined.  I would now like to summarize some of the key business and financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, this includes the full quarter of results for PetCareRx. Number one, we had record setting year-over-year revenue growth. Number two, both new and returning customers increased year-over-year. New customers grew consecutively for three quarters in a row, which is a turnaround from a two-and-a-half year decline. Number three, reorder sales are now $68 million or 87% of our business, which represents growth of 7% year-over-year. Number four, we are launching our new insurance product in the market in conjunction with our insurance partner Pumpkin Insurance next month. While our CFO, Christine Chambers, will delve into a more comprehensive analysis of our quarterly financial performance later in the presentation, I would like to provide a glimpse of some notable financial highlights. For the quarter ending June 30, 2023, sales were 78 million compared to sales of 70 million in the prior year, an 11% increase year-over-year as a result of the combined sales of our recent acquisition of PetCareRx as well as a more stabilized core PetMed business. Furthermore, I am pleased to share positive results pertaining to our new customer base.  In the quarter, we achieved approximately 86,000 new customers representing a 25% year-over-year increase. This marks the third consecutive quarter of net new customer growth, decisively breaking the trend of declining net new customers since Q1 of 2021 and propelling us into our next chapter of growth. This notable achievement is attributed to the continued growth of PetMed's new customer acquisition efforts, combined with increased reach for the PetCareRx acquisition. New customer acquisition efficiency metrics remain in line with our expectations. Customer lifetime value to customer acquisition costs for the quarter stood at 2.0, affirming our commitment to optimizing our marketing investments. We are delighted to report sustained improvements in the subscription part of our business. Our AutoShip and Save program has continued to expand. During the first fiscal quarter, 49% of our revenue was derived from recurring sources through our AutoShip subscription and PetPlus membership programs, marking a significant increase from 34% for the same period last year. Lastly, I want to share our excitement regarding the emerging opportunity in pet insurance. As one of the fastest growing non-medical pet services, pet insurance is projected to continue its upward trajectory. According to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association, a mere 4.4 million pets were insured in 2021, which accounts for less than 5% of the total pet population. Recognizing this as a significant untapped opportunity, we envision that the introduction of our insurance product in partnership with Pumpkin Insurance will be viewed as a valuable offering by our expansive community of over 2 million pet parents. We plan to launch this new insurance offering within the next quarter, further solidifying our commitment to comprehensive pet care solutions.  Turning to Slide 6. Over the past several quarters, we have extensively discussed our strategy and future direction. PetMed is undergoing a transformation from being a prominent pet medication retailer to positioning itself as the foremost authority in pet healthcare, a market leader in expertise on pet well being. Our goal is to become every pet parent's go-to destination for holistic health and wellness from nose to tail. To recap, our pet healthcare strategy revolves around four key pillars; medication, care, nutrition and wellness.  PetMed has long established itself as one of the largest and most trusted pet pharmacies in the United States. Our logistical expertise enables us to facilitate and authorize millions of prescription orders annually, bridging the gap between veterinarians and pet parents. The acquisition of PetCareRx represents a significant growth opportunity for PetMed Express, as we are now actively working on introducing premium and prescription food to our extensive base of over 2 million pet parents.  In terms of care, we recognize the potential of the nascent pet telemedicine market as a substantial opportunity as regulations continue to evolve. We have closely observed the shifting regulatory landscape with more and more states embracing pet telemedicine. Today, we offer our full telemedicine product in over 25 states. Starting in September, we will offer telemedicine in Arizona with Florida, Colorado and California expected in Q4. These new geographical areas present untapped markets encompassing a combined population of nearly 150 million people, with 75% of them being pet owners in need of care for their pets.  Our partnership with Vetster is an important element of our growth strategy, as it has enabled PetMed to become the first pet retailer to offer pet telemedicine to pet parents by a larger scale. This important and strategic bet will continue to evolve alongside regulatory changes, consumer education and awareness. To further enable our pet parents towards accessing care and achieving wellness for their pets. We are excited to soon be able to offer pet insurance. Our partnership with leading insurance company Pumpkin Insurance, which is now majority owned by JAB Holding, will bring incremental value to our customers and will bring incremental profitability to PetMed over time.  We consider these four pillars; medication, care, nutrition and wellness crucial in establishing a unique preferred brand and experience for pet parents everywhere, positioning ourselves as their go-to destination. We are now better positioned to offer our over 2 million pet parents more health options than ever before. We have a wider variety of premium prescription food, health food options and supplements. Pet parents can book a vet telemedicine appointment on our Web site and starting soon, through our partnership with Pumpkin Insurance, we can soon begin offering health insurance for our furry family members.  Now I'd like to hand the presentation over to Christine.\nChristine Chambers: Thanks, Matt. I'm delighted to report our Q1 fiscal year 2024 results for the quarter ending June 30, 2023. This will be the first quarter of combined results, including the acquisition of PetCareRx compared to PetMed only in Q1 fiscal year 2023 and the prior quarters. The PetCareRx acquisition closed on April 3, 2023. And the consolidated results reflect almost a full quarter of PetCareRx performance.  First quarter sales was 78.2 million compared to sales of 70.2 million in the same period last year, growth of 11.5%. The growth year-over-year was due to incremental sales from the combination of PetCareRx as well as growth in PetMed's new customer sales with a slight offset in PetMed's reorder sales, which is continuing to stabilize.  As Matt previously mentioned, we continued our trend of net new customer growth year-over-year. We welcomed approximately 86,000 new pet parents this quarter compared to 69,000 in the prior year. This represents new customer growth of 25% year-over-year. In addition, reorder sales of 68 million for the quarter increased 7% compared to the reorder sales of 63.3 million in the same period last year.  With the acquisition of PetCareRx, we also added 2.4 million of revenue associated with our PetCareRx membership programs, which provide bulk wholesale offerings, a diverse product range and an emphasis on value and savings for its customers. We've continued to grow our recurring revenue, including AutoShip and Save sales and PetCareRx membership sales as a percentage of total sales. This drives greater engagement and strengthens our recurring sales base. As Matt mentioned, recurring sales as a percentage of total sales was 49% in the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up from 34% compared to the same period last year.  Gross profit for the quarter as a percentage of sales was 28.8% compared to 28.4% in the same quarter last year, and 27.9% in the prior quarter. G&A increased 6.4 million year-over-year, in part due to the combination of PetCareRx and an increase in payroll expenses for new hires made in fiscal year 2023 as well as 1.1 million in acquisition costs. Since the acquisition, PetCareRx has benefited from improved supplier terms and direct manufacturing relationships driving synergies and improvements to gross margin.  In addition, we are combining operating procedures and teams that naturally drive G&A cost synergies and more efficient processes. Net loss for the first quarter was 900,000 or $0.04 per diluted share compared to net income of 2.8 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the same period last year. Excluding the acquisition-related costs, net income would have been 200,000 or $0.01 per diluted share.  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 3.3 million compared to 6.3 million in the same quarter last year. Increased gross profit and other income of 2.9 million was offset by $5 million of higher adjusted EBITDA expenses, excluding non-operating items and 900,000 higher advertising expenses.  Turning to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with 61.5 million of cash on our balance sheet and no debt. This takes into consideration that on April 3, 2023, we paid $63 million in cash for PetCareRx. Over the long run, management remains committed to driving total shareholder return. We have declared a $0.30 cash dividend in June this year at the same level as prior quarters. As always, we will continue to balance the need for capital to fuel growth opportunities with the payment of dividends.  Our business continues to perform well with a more stable PetMed core business that continues to build recurring revenue through a growing customer base, combined with our recent acquisition of PetCareRx. For the balance of the year, we will continue to focus efforts on setting up the expanded product catalogue which will drive future organic growth.  Operating synergies continue to provide us with opportunities to improve margins. And in the longer term, we believe in value creation from adding differentiated services with our Vetster and Pumpkin partnerships with a more immediate upside to our PetMed's business through expanding our wallet share through selling food on a broader assortment of consumables.  I will now turn the call back over to Matt for some concluding remarks prior to Q&A.\nMatt Hulett: Thank you, Christine. The upcoming fiscal year holds significance for PetMed as we transition into a growth focused business. Our goal is to deliver healthy top line revenue growth while maintaining relative stability in fixed costs. We anticipate achieving operating leverage as we scale our revenue. As I have previously emphasized, investors should expect our management team to remain intensely focused on integrating our recent investments and executing on our strategic vision. We are confident that we've assembled the necessary components to deliver sustainable long-term growth and profitability.  At PetMed, we are highly optimistic about our growth strategy and future performance. We are enthusiastic about the strategic direction we're pursuing as a premium specialty retailer brand. We firmly believe that the expansive pet market offers ample opportunities for us to navigate and thrive by providing distinctive solutions for pet parents. As we have consistently emphasized, our aim is to become the trusted pet health expert for pet parents. Over the past year, we have shared our growth strategy with you. And we have made substantial progress in building a resilient, profitable and continually growing pet health company.  With that, we conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to address any questions you may have.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Meyers with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Meyers: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one for me, I'm just curious if we strip out the PetCareRx business, what did the legacy business -- revenue for the legacy business look like during the quarter? And how have you seen kind of further stabilization there?\nMatt Hulett: Hey, Ryan, this is Matt. I'll take that answer and then Christine, feel free to jump on if I don't cover it in the detail that's required. Ryan, just to step back from the question, we've really made, as you know, an effort to consolidate the PetCareRx and PetMed's financials primarily for two reasons. One is we're running the PetCareRx business as an integrated part of the business from a operating perspective, but also PetCareRx is really a mini version of PetMed out of the same unit economics. We've talked about similar gross margin. So that's how we kind of think about it. And then two, we think about PetCareRx from an acquisition thesis perspective is really delivering on an unlock for catalogue expansion. As you know, PetMed has a very high concentration of medication sales and very little on everything else, including food and other largely popular consumables. And so we think about PetCareRx as a natural extension of the business. That said, we have talked about PetCareRx as being the majority step up of improvement year-over-year in the business. And then we called out net new customer growth for PetMed and PetCareRx, but we can say that PetMed did experience on a standalone basis year-over-year growth. And to kind of the heart of your question is the stabilization of the returning base, Ryan. We're feeling that the returning base is much more stabilized than it has been especially since when I started a couple of years ago. And that's kind of how we think about the business from a consolidated perspective. And really our eye is towards selling more products for the same customer, utilizing that PetCareRx catalogue. And, Christine, I don't know if there's anything else you'd like to add to that.\nChristine Chambers: I think you've captured it, Matt, on the top line. And as you know, Ryan, we are bringing the two companies together, like Matt mentioned, in a way that we're looking to drive cost synergies over time as well. So that's just something to consider as we bring those two companies together, but really operating as one entity.\nRyan Meyers: Got it. That's helpful. And then, obviously, I know it's only been a quarter with the PetCareRx acquisition, but is there any way to quantify sort of the cross-selling revenue that you guys have been able to see or how you kind of expect that to play out over the next couple of quarters?\nChristine Chambers: Yes. So I think, Ryan, in terms of the -- as Matt said, we're really thinking about the levers that we have between the two businesses and operations. As you know, we're very focused on driving the expanded catalogue on to our PetMed’s customers, and I think we'll see the growth associated with that over time. Matt, do you want to add anything?\nMatt Hulett: Yes, I think the natural extension of that will be larger LTV for our customer base. In previous earnings calls, we get a lot of questions around average order value. We actually don't think average order value will be the best metric to follow. Because when we do our jobs successfully, with getting more repeated purchases outside of the irregular prescription refill cycle that we're on, AOV could actually vary quite a bit. And, again, the measure for us long-term will be LTV growth over time. The last thing I would say is we just started successfully integrating large swaths of the PetCareRx catalogue, like we said on the call, including the Purina line of products, which we didn't have access to, up until just a couple of months ago. And it just recently went up on our site several weeks ago. So it's early days, but we're already seeing traction on our ability to cross-sell and upsell different products. So stay tuned, but we think that the best measure will be LTV.\nRyan Meyers: Great, that's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMatt Hulett: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. So just first as a follow-up, just to clarify. So on Slide #5, you guys talked about reorder growth of 7% year-over-year. But then, I think Christine, when you got on, you said that there was a slight offset in reorder sales. So I'm just trying to put the two together. I don't know if you were talking about the core business or the legacy business being down. Just wanted to get more clarity on that, please.\nChristine Chambers: Yes. Hi, Anthony, and thanks for the question. So we did talk about on the PetMed's new customer base growing and obviously, as the majority of the growth from the quarter around the combined PCRx acquisition. What I did also mention is that the PetMed's returning base. And again, we are looking at this very much at a combined basis. But specific to the PetMed's returning base, we did see a slight decline. And that's the base that we continue to focus on and we see as starting to -- that decline starting to stabilize. So it was specific to that business. But like I said and Matt mentioned earlier, we are looking at the results more on a consolidated basis. And that's where you're seeing that 7% reorder sales growth.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Okay. Thank you for that. So far, you're one month into the second fiscal quarter. Have you seen signs of continuous stabilization? Or can you give us an early readout as to what you're seeing so far? I mean, obviously, the summer is peak time for flea and tick medications. And just wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing thus far into the second quarter.\nChristine Chambers: Yes, I think we see -- we're very much looking at this on a, like I said, on a combined basis. I think PetMed business is the returning base. We're really excited about the expanded catalogue, how that expanded catalogue continues to drive additional reorder sales and then enables PetMed's space to grow over time. We're really focused on increasing that wallet share of the existing PetMed space and others existing PetMed returning orders and seeing that change in the trajectory over time based on that expanded catalogue that we're really focused on at this stage.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Okay, gotcha. And then in terms of the synergies, can you expand on that? Just maybe talk a little bit more in terms of the timing. And is this mostly on gross margins or you think you can achieve some operating expense synergies?\nChristine Chambers: Yes, that's a good question. We very much see similar unit economics, gross margin assumptions across both businesses. I think where we'll expect to see improvement in the bottom line over time is the cost synergies that improve SG&A as a percentage of revenue. As we've mentioned, these businesses are very similar in that as we're bringing some of those operations together and also we see the expansion of LTV without a huge increase in CAC. And so we will, like Matt mentioned, very much focus on that LTV to CAC ratio over time, as we see the expansion of the catalogue, and then separately the SG&A improve over time based on those cost synergies across vendor relationships and efficiencies that we're driving across our operations.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got you, okay. And then my last question, I know you guys declared the dividend. Do you have any update or thoughts on how investors should think about the dividend, or it's just kind of more of the same as you talked about on your last call?\nChristine Chambers: Yes, the dividend is always something that we think about as well. We do think there are opportunities for growth and investment. And we believe, as we're turning the corner to being or as we are now a growth company, we have shown year-over-year growth for the first quarter, and I think as we drive momentum over more than one quarter, there could be a scenario whereby we see higher returns from using free cash flow, for reinvestment versus paying the dividend. And so we're always looking at the balance for the capital allocation need for capital to fuel growth. So I think there'll be more to come.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Well, thank you and best of luck.\nChristine Chambers: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. Our question-and-answer session portion of the call has ended. I would like to now turn the call back over to Matt Hulett, the company CEO for his concluding remarks.\nMatt Hulett: Thank you for joining our call today. And I'm confident that the future we envision for PetMed along with the foundation that we've been laying will meet the market opportunity in unique and innovative ways and will lead to increased operating results and shareholder value. PetMed's brand, expertise and reputation are unparalleled. We have greatly accelerated our offering roadmap, and we look forward to sharing our progress as we go to market with products and services that positively change the lives of our pet parents and pets. Thank you for your continued support.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
