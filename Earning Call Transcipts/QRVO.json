        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for Qorvo. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Doug DeLieto, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDouglas DeLieto: Hello, everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's press release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Grant Brown, CFO; Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales & Marketing; and other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Thanks, Doug, and welcome everyone to Qorvo's fiscal 2024 third quarter call. I would like to start by complementing the team for delivering another solid quarter. The demand environment in the December quarter improved versus our November outlook, and this is reflected in our strong performance. Looking at our business from a high level, Qorvo is capitalizing on secular trends, including connectivity, sustainability, and electrification. These trends are playing out over many years and they are fueling the transition to new technologies and new standards like 5G advanced, WiFi 7, [indiscernible], DOCSIS 4.0, and others. As a result, customers across our businesses are increasingly seeking higher levels of efficiency and performance, where performance is measured in power out, talk time or time between charges. Qorvo is central to these transitions, and we are critical to enabling these capabilities. We leverage unique competitive strengths to supply our customers best-in-class solutions that enhance efficiency, increase throughput, and reduce form factor. We are a preferred supplier with leading products and a robust technology roadmap and we are positioned favorably for broad-based growth across our three operating segments. Now letâ€™s turn to our strategic highlights, beginning with HPA. Customer demand in end-markets, excluding base station is improving and supports our view for a return to year-over-year growth in HPA in the March quarter. In defense and aerospace, we want an expanded radar design with a major DoD contractor and we received new standard product orders in support of several large domestic and international ground-based radar systems. We also enjoyed increasing demand for our solid-state PA products and for our switch filter bank products across multiple customers and programs. There are multi-year secular trends driving our D&A business, including the trend of one-to-many, and the transition of mechanical systems to active electronics scanning systems, both of which increased requirements for more advanced systems-level RF solutions. Earlier today, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Boston-based Anokiwave. Anokiwave is a leading supplier of high-performance integrated silicon ICs for intelligent active array antennas. We are excited to have the Anokiwave team join Qorvo and expand our offerings for defense and aerospace, SATCOM, and 5G applications. In power management, we are extending our reach in markets where Qorvo enjoys a strong presence, such as wearables, and other consumer products. Our most recent award is a PMIC chipset with multiple placements for wearable and charger at a leading Android OEM. Complementing this, we begun to see a rebound in SSDs for PC and enterprise markets. We are continuing to expand upon our strong position, with an additional power management win in support of a leading manufacturer of laptops. Lastly, our recently launched QSPICE, circuit simulation software was honored as the design tool and development software product of the year, at the 2023 Elektra Awards. In power devices, we're shipping into power supplies for blockchain applications, and design activity in data center continues to be strong. We are also seeing increased activity in circuit protection, where our JFET technology brings unique advantages. In automotive, design activity remains strong, not only for onboard chargers, but also for other emerging applications and electric vehicles. In infrastructure, Qorvo is leading the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade cycle. We commence volume shipments of our newest DOCSIS 4.0 hybrid power doubler in support of multiple cable OEMs. In the cellular base station market, inventories continue to be consumed and we expect demand conditions to remain soft through calendar year 2024. Turning to CSG customer activity for ultra-wideband is increasing in secure access automotive applications. We're also seeing new applications for ultra-wideband in automotive, including presence detection and other radar-based sensors. This momentum builds upon our recent wins in ultra-wideband, including an in-vehicle car access platform and a flagship Android smartphone launch. As we demonstrated at CES, we are actively involved in a wide array of enterprise and connected home solutions, leveraging [radar] (ph) and ultra-wideband for applications such as door locks, smart lighting, and indoor navigation. In force-sensing touch sensors, we received the first production orders for an automotive supplier in support of a leading career-based automotive OEM. We are seeing increasing traction across a growing set of customers and markets, including automotive, laptop trackpads, wearables, and smart home. In WiFi, design activity and collaboration remain strong across reference designs, customers, and operators. Within the Android ecosystem, the demand environment for mobile WiFi is improving with the normalization of Android channel inventories. In access points, WiFi 6 volumes continue to grow with certain provider rollouts in India. In WiFi 7, Qorvo secured design wins across operator, retail, enterprise, and mobile segments. In ACG, we commenced shipments in support of the spring 2024 flagship smartphone launch by the leading Android smartphone OEM. On our last earnings call, we highlighted our content gains in the flagship tier. In addition to the ultra-wideband, Qorvo content this year includes, the low band, mid-high-band, ultra-high band, secondary transmit and receive, tuning, and WiFi. We are ramping up now and building upon our momentum with a broad set of design wins in this customer's high-volume mass-market portfolio. Android mass-market smartphones are set to transition to 5G through the decade. In our collaboration with Android customers on their long-term product roadmaps positions Qorvo to be a primary beneficiary as these new 5G units [indiscernible]. To that end, Qorvo was recognized by the top four China-based Android 5G OEMs with 2023 awards for innovation, quality, supply, technology, and strategic partnership. To simplify 5G adoption and sustain our position as the leading global strategic supplier to Android OEMs, we continue to launch new architectures and new products that enhance performance and reduce form factors. During the quarter, we expanded customer sampling of our newly launched main path, LMH pad. This highly integrated solution is optimized for mass-market smartphones. It combines in a single placement, the low, mid, and high band main path content traditionally offered in two placements. This reduces surface area by 40%, simplifies design, and accelerates time to market. In addition to developing highly integrated solutions with increasing levels of functional density, we're also advancing technology in our high-performance discrete portfolio, including our BAW filters. During the quarter, we received purchase orders for discrete BAW filters using our recently released next-generation BAW technology. During the quarter we continue to bring channel inventories down and now our shipments are more closely aligned with end-market demand. We are also seeing incremental improvement in end-market demand in the Android ecosystem. For calendar 2024, we expect total smartphone units to grow in low single digits, with 5G units growing over 10%. To compete and win, we collaborate with customers on their three-year product roadmaps and we supply them industry-leading solutions. We enjoy our position as the preferred strategic RF supplier for all the customers we serve in the Android space, and we are very well positioned to benefit as their portfolios continue to transition to 5G. In summary, demand for Qorvo's products has improved, primarily due to our proactive efforts to align channel inventories with end-market demand and content gains on key customer programs. We are delivering customers industry-leading products and technologies, and design activity remains robust. This positions Qorvo favorably for continued strong content and durable long-term growth. And with that, let me hand the call over to Grant.\nGrant Brown: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $1.074 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.8% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.10, all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue increased approximately 44% year-over-year and continue to benefit from significant content gains at our largest customer. As communicated last quarter, ACG achieved year-over-year growth in September, CSG achieved year-over-year growth during the September quarter, and we expect HPA to achieve strong year-over-year growth in the March quarter. Regarding gross margin, a larger portion of December revenue was manufactured internally during periods of lower utilization, which led to higher unit costs compared to the September quarter. Factory utilization is improving and the impact from underutilization in factory-related variances continues to moderate. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $234 million. We continue to invest in new product development as it is a critical catalyst for driving multi-year growth across all three business segments. Alongside these growth-oriented investments, we continue to launch productivity initiatives across the enterprise. These initiatives also spanning multiple years, are designed to support future growth, augment productivity, and enhance profitability. In total, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $237 million or 22% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $206 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $2.10. Turning to the cash flow statement. We're pleased to report that during the December quarter, we generated a free cash flow of $467 million, setting a new quarterly record for Qorvo. Our capital expenditures for the period were $26 million and we repurchased approximately $100 million of stock at $94 per share. The rate and pace of our share repurchases consider several factors, including our long-term financial outlook, free cash flow, debt maturities, alternative uses of cash, and other relevant strategic considerations. This approach ensures that our capital allocation strategy balances future growth with the return of capital, and aligns with our underlying goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. On the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we had approximately $1.6 billion of long-term debt outstanding and over $1 billion of cash and equivalents. Regarding balance sheet presentation, the 2024 notes have been reclassified as current and will mature in December. Subject to changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, we currently expect to retire these notes later this year. In line with the expectations shared during our previous earnings call, we successfully reduced our net inventory balance over the period. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $727 million, a sequential decrease of $113 million. In terms of days of inventory, this represents a decrease from 138 days in the September quarter, to 118 days in the December quarter. This reduction reflects our commitment to efficient inventory management, and we expect continued improvement in the March quarter. Turning to the current quarter outlook, we expect revenue of approximately $925 million plus or minus $25 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 42%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.20 at the midpoint of the revenue range. Relative to December, we expect March revenue to reflect a larger percentage of higher cost inventories previously manufactured internally during periods of lower utilization. As these higher cost previously manufactured inventories sell through, it paves the way for future gross margins that reflect increasing levels of utilization. We currently expect to have sold through most of these higher cost inventories and associated costs by the second half of this calendar year. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter will be approximately $245 million, with variability related to labor-related expenses and the timing of program development spend. Below the operating income line, non-operating expense is expected to be approximately $10 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be within a range of 11% to 13%. In December, we announced a new partnership with Luxshare related to the divestiture of our Beijing and Dezhou assembly and test facilities. Upon the closing of this transaction, Luxshare will acquire each facility's operations and assets, which includes the property, plant, and equipment, as well as the existing workforce, to enable the seamless continuity of operations. Qorvo will continue to maintain our sales, product and test engineering, and customer support employees in China. We believe that adding Luxshare as a strategic partner will strengthen our position to serve our customers globally. As it relates to our manufacturing strategy, this is a further step in our ongoing efforts to reduce capital intensity. This move aligns with previous actions, including the closure of our Florida manufacturing operations and the recent sale of our Farmers Branch facility in Texas. We are efficiently managing a complex supply chain, including our internal factories, which support all three operating segments and will remain an ongoing focus. We will leverage internal manufacturing where it uniquely differentiates our products and outsource production where we maintain a strong network of foundry and OSAT partners. Qorvo is well positioned to capitalize on multiple growth drivers within each of our three operating segments. We are confident that our investments in our technology portfolio, product development, and advanced manufacturing will broaden our addressable market, diversify revenue, expand margin, and accelerate growth. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I have two questions. The first one on content growth for this year. Bob, obviously you guys did a really good job last year in gaining content, not only at your largest customer but across the board. I know it's a little bit early, but curious how you're thinking about your potential to grow content this year, again, at the largest customer, as well as on the Android side. You gave great color on your career-based customer, but curious how you're thinking about the year across the board? Thank you.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Toshiya, thanks for your question. And it does seem there's some reports last night have created some confusion about our business. So I think it's best I go ahead and address it now that you gave me the opportunity with your first question. Based on our known design wins and engagements with our largest customer, one of our competitors, I think, it's been named Qualcomm, we don't believe they're competing on any of the sockets we're engaged in, they did not win any sockets that we've been in, nor do we see them challenging our share in any of the sockets we're competing for or investing in at our largest customer. In fact, you can ask them. We're quite confident, they would tell you the same thing. Now specifically to ultra-high band, we've made it clear on past calls, it was a multi-source socket, and we were the only company that consistently won over the last three years. We've never had 100% share of the ultra-high band. In fact, you can look at teardowns of the latest iPhone and see Qorvo won the ultra-high band in the Pro and Pro Max models. I know, I've said and many of our teams said consistently that this is a performance driven customer and we're winning based on multi-year engagements, our technology investments, and clearly our product performance. And we expect to grow with our largest customer in FY 2025 and grow even more in FY 2026. I wish I could give you more specifics, but I think that answers your question, Toshiya.\nToshiya Hari: Yes. I appreciate the color. Thanks, Bob. And then as my follow-up, one for Grant on the gross margin side. I think three months ago you had shared the underutilization charge of, I think it was 550 basis points for the September quarter. Curious what the headwind was in December, what's embedded in your March quarter guidance? And more importantly, as you progress through the year, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins? And sorry, one last one. The Luxshare deal, how should we think about that potentially benefiting gross margins medium to long term? Thank you.\nGrant Brown: Sure, Toshiya. Let me try and take all those in order. So the first one in terms of the impact from the underutilization charges, it's about half, maybe a little less than half of what we had previously reported. And as I pointed out, we'll be working through those higher cost inventories over the balance of this year and should clear them in the second half. So that should give you a sense of the timing there. There's a lot of moving factors that influence gross margin in addition to underutilization. So the timing of where something was built, when it was built, and then in any given period when it's sold. In the September quarter, for example, we had a relatively high percentage of product mix that was manufactured at external silicon foundries and then processed at third-party OSATs versus a higher percentage in the December and what we anticipate in March to be manufactured internally during prior periods of lower utilization. So there's this lag effect I described last quarter. The underutilization in past periods obviously conferred in the products sold in future periods. But beyond March, no change to our guidance of returning to 50% plus gross margin over time. We have line of sight to get there. Once we sell through the high-cost inventories, as I mentioned, it's encouraging on the utilization front as it's improving and will continue to execute on further productivity opportunities as well. I've commented in my prepared remarks that we expect to have worked through all of that as I mentioned in the second half and that'll clear the path for margins that reflect higher levels of factory utilization going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRuben Roy: Thank you. Bob, first of all, on the unit assumptions that you have for the year, low single digits, I think you said for the total smartphone market and then 5G, 10% or so. How are you thinking about sort of non-China Android and China Android as you think about your mix going forward. It would seem like you're doing quite well, obviously, in Korea and elsewhere. Just wondering kind of where you think things shake out with China Android as you kind of progress through calendar 2024.\nDave Fullwood: Hey, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I'll take that one. So as Bob mentioned, as we said before, we enjoy a really strong position as the preferred strategic supplier for all our Android customers. We engage with them on multiple years out on their product roadmaps. And it's really a special seat at the table that we have as their leading global supplier. They care deeply about our products, our technology, but also the quality and the supply assurance that we deliver. And we've been that trusted supplier for all of our Android customers for many, many years. And the one thing we've learned is, you have to be there for them over the long term. You can't just come in and out of a market and expect to gain any meaningful share. So at our China customers, as Bob mentioned, we received top supplier awards for innovation, quality, supply, strategic partnership for 2023. And that includes awards from Honor, OPPO, Xiaomi, and Vivo. And we're also proud of our position in Android outside of China as well. Bob highlighted the great content in the new Samsung Galaxy S24. For multiple years now we provide a full lineup of ultra-high band, mid-high band, secondary transmit path, low band, tuning and Wi-Fi and this year we added ultra-wide band. We're also excited to receive initial purchase orders for our next generation mid-high band with integrated diversity receive. We announced that product a few quarters ago, and we have our first purchase orders for a US-based Android customer. And this part brings a new level of integration for size and performance, leveraging our latest filter technology for BAW and SAW. And we've also got a lot of other great content on that phone that we're excited to tell you about in the future as well. We believe we're best positioned to grow with our Android customers as their products continue to transition to 5G over the coming years. And we've got a lot of great new opportunities in content we can address with ultra-wideband, touch sensors and power management. So we feel really good about our position really across the entire Android ecosystem.\nRuben Roy: That's great. Thank you for all that detail. Quick follow-up for Grant on the Luxshare commentary. How are you thinking, Grant, about sort of longer-term CapEx? Clearly, this is part of sort of the longer-term strategy around CapEx, but if you could speak to that. I know the deal is going to close first half of 2024, so maybe a little bit early, but has anything changed, I guess, with the strategy around CapEx and cash flow assumptions that you have as you think about sort of the next 12 to 18 months?\nGrant Brown: Sure. The cash flow question, I think -- as we look forward, as I've always said, we'll follow the P&L. So, largely that'll be dictated by our -- by the growth that Bob mentioned in fiscal 2025 and 2026. In terms of our CapEx as a percentage of the top line, we do expect it to continue in that 5% or less category. If there are capacity additions made, it will be in response to demand and the capacity required to serve it. As it relates to the sale of Beijing and Dezhou, we're really excited to partner with Luxshare as we transition those sites. The agreement is over multiple years, and there is obviously some benefits there for Qorvo as the volume increases, and we found a great partner to help reduce our capital intensity and we're confident in their ability to provide the cost improvements that we'd expect over time in a rather similar relationship to what we incur today cost-wise at those locations.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charity -- I'm sorry, Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.\nEdward Snyder: We're not at charity just yet. A couple things. Bob, thank you very much for clearing that up [indiscernible] I really appreciate that, that creates a lot of confusion. Maybe we can shift gears in a little bit, on the Android market I know [indiscernible] very well in China and the whole inventory suggestion, that's all I think fairly clear now. But when you get back to the normal run rate here, the content game seems to be shifted a little bit. The Chinese suppliers have picked up a little bit, but they don't seem to be threatening you in modules. And now you're talking about these very high integrated modules which would separate you from any other competitors. I think only [Skyworks] (ph) even has that part yet. So one, content wise, by combining all that into a single module, it must be -- the sum of the parts isn't quite equal to the individual pieces. Is it a content decline just on average or are you pulling in content that you may not have had before or are they paying for a premium? So I'm just trying to get an idea of how that shakes out when China finally gets back to a normal run rate? And then I had a follow up, please.\nDave Fullwood: Yes, this is Dave. It kind of depends. So when you -- Bob mentioned our low-mid-high, and so that's a combination of what used to be the mid-high band, which we generally enjoyed a pretty high share of that. And the low band, which we had good share, but we shared a lot of that with some other competitors. But when we integrate the low, mid, high altogether, obviously, we can pick up some content there overall as we support customers with that platform. You also have to look at the different SKU strategies that our customers have. So depending what markets they serve, there may be more or less filter content. So we work with them, as Bob mentioned and I mentioned as well, on their long-term road maps to help architect, to support their solutions across those different tiers. So whether they're doing a global SKU or they're doing regional SKUs, we can tier the product along with that to fit the need that they have there.\nEdward Snyder: Great. And then if I could, you historically haven't sold discrete filters in quite a long time for lack of memory. I know you're doing it now. Is that why -- well, first of all, maybe give us some idea of where those are going. Is that mostly into WiFi? I mean who, where, what? And is it driven mostly by the fact that you have capacity in Texas to support that, whereas you're not seeing maybe as much in some of the modules that you did before? And then -- yes, let's just do that one.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Yeah, and it's an interesting one. So we've been in the discrete filter market. It's just not been a huge business for us because we focus more on the modules, as you said. But it's a very good performing module. It is for 5G, not for Wi-Fi. And I like to use an example, as customers even in that tier of the market are paying for performance. They want the latest and greatest technology from us. And even on a very base product, like a discrete filter, they're still looking for performance. So we're pretty excited about those products.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. Two, if I may. A question first for Grant. With shutdowns of your Florida facility, which I believe was historically SAW, and the sale of Farmers Branch, but also expansion of your Richardson facility, I guess, why wouldn't gross margins exceed 50% on a lower revenue base than the prior peak as 5G unit volume continue to grow from here?\nGrant Brown: Sure. So, those are all productivity enhancements, and then as we talked about, it's largely a utilization, a function of utilization. So in addition to just shuttering some of those facilities that you mentioned, we're also producing significantly smaller die. And so we have effective capacity that has grown regardless of the number of wafers. So you can get more die out of a given wafers. So there's productivity there. And I would say there's a lot of productivity opportunities for us looking forward as we work into that across the board. So, there's productivity initiatives that we still have to do, and in terms of why we haven't achieved 50%, it's, again, largely a utilization issue.\nKarl Ackerman: Sure. Thanks for that, Grant. I guess, Bob, you also mentioned that 5G units would grow over 10% this calendar year. I'm curious if that is done predominantly in mid-range across maybe the China Android OEMs, or is that only from Korean and US OEMs? If you could give us some color on the constitution of the 5G unit growth in calendar 2024, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Yes, thanks for the question, Karl. It's primarily the Android ecosystem, so it would include all the Android manufacturers, because we're seeing some of -- in China, the manufacturers that are not [indiscernible] also moving into 5G. So it's a broad comment across the Android ecosystem is what we see driving most of that growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. I guess on your March quarter outlook, pretty solid guide by the way. Bob, just trying to understand the puts and takes by different segments. I think you said HPA is going to grow nicely in March quarter, which seems to imply that the smartphone business is probably seasonal. But based on what you said, it looks like Android is coming back a bit and your content is increasing. So I'm just curious as to why it's not better than seasonal as we look into the March quarter?\nGrant Brown: Sure. Hi, Srini, this is Grant, I'll take that question. We don't guide specifically by segment, but our views are incorporated in the total guidance. I will give a bit of color on each. In APG, we expect substantial year-on-year growth despite the typical sequential decline associated with our largest customers fall ramp, partially offsetting that seasonal decline is healthier channel inventories and improving smartphone unit demand in China, as well as the flagship launch by our largest Android customer. In HPA, we also expect year-over-year growth across all the businesses except base station. From a mixed perspective, the more capital intensive end markets we serve, such as base station and some others, including infrastructure, face headwinds due to the interest rate sensitivity of those customers and some of those larger build-outs. Consequently, defense and aerospace now represents over half of the HPA top line, making that segment a bit more sensitive to the timing of some of those defense programs quarter-to-quarter. In CSG, we also expect year-over-year growth in the March quarter, supported by our WiFi revenue, which we've talked about. It'll be up meaningfully from Q4 last fiscal year. And then slower than expected ramps in IoT-related areas are expected in March, probably persisting through the first half of 2024. Although the auto market appears to be weakening, in general, our secular opportunities there lie in the automotive connectivity areas which are supported by the growing adoption of 5G, WiFi, [indiscernible] and ultra-wideband. I think Dave commented on earlier. We've already announced some significant design wins there in CSG for automotive and smartphone. And we're targeting additional areas including industrial enterprise and smart home.\nSrini Pajjuri: Great. That's great color, Grant. I appreciate that. And then Grant, on cash flow, very, very strong here. Obviously, you had a little bit of a headwind in the first half with working capital. Now I think that has become a tailwind, but quite impressive nevertheless. Can you talk about how you are thinking about cash flow going forward? I think you mentioned CapEx is going to be relatively small and you also suggested that inventory might come down again. So just want to hear your thoughts on cash flow generation going forward. And then what are the uses for the cash going forward? I guess it looks like you made an acquisition and obviously you've been buying back shares. So if you can talk about that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nGrant Brown: Sure. In terms of cash flow next quarter, as you point out, there's a few puts and takes. I would expect CapEx to be up. It's going to follow the level of support for the top line and our capacity additions there for our customers' demand. So I would expect that to be up in the March quarter, but remain on the year under our limit of around 5% well under. The monetization of our receivables is something that I expect will continue. That's been a significant tailwind last quarter, along with the reduction in inventory balances. So, now you're starting to see that come down as we're able to sell through inventories rather than purchase as much new material. So, that helps cash flow. Looking forward, as I've pointed out, rate and pace of our buyback will fluctuate. It's dependent this year on our maturing 2024 notes, which we'll look to take out by December, and then obviously we'll be continuing to grow throughout the calendar year and into fiscal 2025. So, overall, we should see some improvement, but on a quarter-to-quarter basis in March there's some additional items there.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Ramsey with TD Cohen. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thank you very much, guys. Good afternoon. I guess my question is trying to dovetail some expectations the market is increasingly having about AI adoption in clients or handset devices, particularly flagship ones, and dovetail that Bob with your commentary about visibility to maybe accelerating content gains for you with your large customer. And what I'm trying to understand a bit more is, you guys -- as AI, I guess, proliferates over the long term in the handset market, do you view that in and of itself as a driver of TAM or RF content for your company, or is it more that the resources in the phone are going to get jacked up a lot in terms of compute and memory, et cetera, and that puts additional constraints on RF where your company can distinguish itself through R&D and taking out things like cost and board space and power, et cetera. I'm just trying to figure out what you see driving the visibility of content as AI presumably comes into these devices.\nDave Fullwood: Yes, this is Dave. It's early days, as you know, with AI, but it's pretty exciting. I think you hit on a lot of the key points already. I mean, definitely it could be a catalyst that can help improve the replacement rate as people want to upgrade to take advantage of the new AI capabilities that show up in phones. It should drive more data over the network, and that of course means more and better RF. And then as you pointed out, it's going to be more computing processing power in the device which is going to put more pressure on the rest of the phone. And so that translates into performance. And it could be in the RF, and we can deliver better and better RF and lower power consumption to help solve those problems. But also we can deliver power management. And there's a lot of areas in the phone to address with power management that we can use our IP there to help, again, reduce current consumption, improve battery life, and make more room to run the AI on the phone. But it's early, and so we have to see how this plays out. But definitely, we're looking forward to how AI can help drive the smartphone market further.\nMatthew Ramsay: Got it. Thanks for the comments there. That's helpful. I guess as my follow-up, it's just a quick one. I know you guys didn't discuss financial terms or whatnot, but you did announce an acquisition today. Maybe you could give us a little context around the technologies that you're bringing in, the people that you're bringing in. Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nGrant Brown: Thanks for the question, Matt. This is Grant. I'll take that one. We're really excited to bring the Anokiwave team on board here at Qorvo. They bring a highly experienced talent in RF silicon antenna and phased array systems to our D&A group. The technology will complement our existing product portfolio, the beam forming capabilities especially, where we can leverage those with our advanced packaging capabilities. In terms of the deal, we didn't announce the terms as you mentioned, but we do expect to close this quarter and the impact is factored into our guidance. Initially, it'll add revenue in the low single digits per quarter and be slightly dilutive to EPS, but accretive to gross margin and all of that's factored into our guide.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. I wonder if you could speak to seasonality for the rest of the year and recognize that you only want a guide for one quarter. But with, I guess, some of the inventory corrections, certainly in the mobile business, looking like it's behind us. Is the expectation to kind of return to normal seasonal patterns? And then, how does that apply to the non-mobile businesses, which I guess are still going through some degree of correction?\nGrant Brown: It's a little early to comment with any specificity on what would be our fiscal 2025 or the balance of this calendar year largely. But absent any macro-related disruptions, as I pointed out, we do expect to grow and improve our gross margins year-on-year. It's worth pointing out that given the content gains and success we're having in our largest customer and the success in our defense and aerospace areas, our revenue seasonality were closely aligned to those customer programs and ramp profiles. So, as we anticipate that quarterly profile or the shape of revenue across 2025, we expect it to look very similar to 2024. Beyond 2025, we're proactively investing, focusing on diversifying our business and pursuing substantial customer platforms where we have the technology to win and the customer engagement to justify that product development.\nChris Caso: That's helpful. As a follow up to that, if you could speak to the CSG and HPA businesses? And could you give us perhaps an update on what you think are longer-term growth rates for those businesses. There's a lot of different moving parts in there, and I know through this correction, perhaps some of the expectations may have changed in that. What's your outlook for those business as we look over the next two years or so?\nGrant Brown: This is Grant, I'll take that one too. I would think of Qorvo's having a portfolio of diversified businesses that contribute to the revenue line. No change to our long-term growth metrics that we've commented on in the past. But if you decompose the business, about two-thirds of it is ACG, and this is primarily the smartphones and other cellular devices, including tablets and wearables, that we've largely commented on already. The other third of our revenues composed of our HPA and CSG businesses and HPA over half of that business is now defense and Aerospace and then CSG over half of that business is WiFi currently. It hasn't always been the case and HPA base station used to be significantly larger. Those have better than corporate gross margins typically, and so that's an area where we still have a lot of opportunity, but it's underrepresented in HPA at the time. Between HPA and CSG, there's smaller portfolio businesses that range from $25 million to $75 million annually or so, and they address market opportunities in a billion. So there's a lot of room to grow there, substantiating our comments on the strong double-digit growth rates. Our largest investments are aimed at very large customer programs, as I pointed out, in ACG for fiscal 2025 and beyond. We're looking to scale our defense and power franchises within HPA, and we're building our UWB and Matter business and CSG, and all combined, this collection of businesses brings the diversification and some financial resiliency, since they're rarely, if ever, all in phase. It's also interesting to note that in each of our operating segments, the largest businesses all benefit from our shared internal manufacturing capabilities. Our more nascent businesses rely on external capital, and over time, we expect to grow the less capital intensive simply because of the relative growth rates in those smaller businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nThomas O'Malley: Hey, good evening guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask kind of a broader 30,000 foot view question on Huawei's entry into the Android market. Can you just talk about what your internal estimates are for Huawei smartphone penetration in calendar year 2024? And just how that impacts your outlook for Android, particularly as you get into the back half of the calendar year in 2024.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Dave, we also add revenue, what we currently do.\nDave Fullwood: Yes, revenue is very low, near zero or at zero at this point with Huawei. But that's a good question. I think the performance of the phones that are out there, the newer ones, I think is pretty widely known. People have done performance evaluations and there's definitely some performance challenges on those phones. So we don't think that they could export them to other markets. They probably have a very difficult time getting carrier approval. So we think they're limited to China. And so, if you look at their performance to date, since the May 60 ramp, we think they did about $30 million in calendar year 2023. If you take the last four months of data and you start to project that forward, you can see an incremental 10 million to 20 million units added in CY 2024. So that's kind of how we're sizing it right now, and that's all built into our models.\nGrant Brown: Yes, there was probably some pent up demand from Huawei users, so we'll have to see how that plays out and how sustainable that is. But in any case, any of those numbers you use, it's really not that significant when you think about a 1.2 billion unit smartphone market. So it's not that meaningful to us on a grand scale of things. And when we think about our China customers, the ones I mentioned earlier, they have pretty meaningful market shares also outside of China. And that's where a lot of the growth is coming from that Bob talked about as the market converts to 5G because most of China has already moved to 5G. So for us, we look at that as a great opportunity to work with those customers to continue to grow and that 5G comes into our market, because we're really not present today in the 4G portion of the market.\nThomas O'Malley: Helpful. And since that one wasn't your favorite, I can give you a bit of a layup now. But just if you look at the competitive environment in Android at the high end. Your competitor is talking about having a bit more capacity and maybe going after that market. Can you remind us of your competitive positioning there, particularly in BAW filters, and why existing customers go with you? And if they were to enter the market why you think that you'd keep the share profile that you have today? Thank you.\nRobert Bruggeworth: You're referring to the Android market?\nThomas O'Malley: The Android market.\nRobert Bruggeworth: I think I commented on this earlier. I mean we've been working with these customers for a very, very long time. In fact, I was just in China last quarter, sat with all of these customers talking about our long-term roadmaps and we mentioned the awards we got. I mean, there's a lot of trust and relationship that's been built up over the years. So we're very confident that we'll continue to enjoy our leadership position there. And other competitors, I mean, they may come and go, but we feel confident we'll maintain our leadership position there.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nRobert Bruggeworth: We want to thank everyone for joining us on the call tonight. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to speaking with many of you at upcoming investor events. Thanks again, and have a great evening.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDouglas DeLieto: Thanks very much. Hello, everybody and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Grant Brown, CFO; Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing and other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Bruggeworth: Thanks, Doug, and welcome everyone to Qorvo's fiscal 2024 second quarter call. Revenue, margin and EPS were all above the high-end of our outlook provided during our August earnings call. Customer demand during the September quarter improved versus our August guidance. The primary driver was a large smartphone customer ramp. In addition, channel inventories of Qorvo components across the Android ecosystem continued to be consumed with OEMs indicating inventory levels are approaching historical norms. Channel inventory digestion is allowing Qorvo to ship more closely to end market demand, even as pockets of channel inventory remained in markets such as base station. We have worked closely with our customers to address inventories, while continuing to deliver highly-differentiated products. They have rewarded us with new opportunities and new design wins and this underpins our expectations for growth this year and beyond. Across our three operating segments, Qorvo enjoys multi-year technology upgrade cycles supported by global macro trends, including connectivity, sustainability and electrification. New protocols and new technologies are offering improved performance and enhanced functionality and Qorvo is critical in enabling these capabilities. This is playing out in aerospace and defense, automotive, base station, broadband, connected home, power devices, power management, smartphones, Wi-Fi and other markets. Where the performance is measured power out, data throughput, talk time, battery life or distance between charges, customers increasingly require higher levels of power efficiency, integration and functional density. To enable their future architectures and deliver successive improvements in our next-generation products, they rely on Qorvo's best-in-class technologies and solutions. In HPA, we are a strong beneficiary of the trends in our defense and aerospace business towards what we call one to many. Put simply, Qorvo's technologies are supporting higher customer volumes requiring more electronics and higher levels of integration. This applies to unmanned vehicles like drones, upgrades to existing radar systems, low earth orbit satellites and other applications. Lastly, we are leading the transition to DOCSIS 4.0, and broadband and we continue to deliver base station customers increasing levels of functional integration for their 5G massive-MIMO deployments. Looking at our power franchise, we offer a highly-differentiated solution with our silicon carbide JFET architecture. Our technology offers the lowest RDS(on) which translates into faster battery charging, longer battery life and lower current consumption for applications like EVs, solar inverters and data centers. These are relatively new markets for Qorvo that are early in the transition to silicon carbide and offer significant growth. We also offer a differentiated portfolio in power management, where our initial wins have been in SSDs, power tools and appliances and we are leveraging our unique IP to expand in the defense, infrastructure, smartphones, wearables and other markets. In CSG, new technologies are transforming user experiences in automotive, connected home, enterprise, industrial and other markets. Ultra-wideband is a critical focus area and we're very excited about recent developments. Ultra-wideband is in the very early innings of adoption and we are seeing exciting opportunities, giving expanded smartphone adoption, multiple in-vehicle placements and an array of new capabilities such as ranging and precision location for indoor navigation. Wi-Fi is another primary driver and the transition to Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 is very early-on. Wi-Fi 7 devices recently launched by Qorvo's customers are offering breakthrough advances in speed, latency and network capacity. Qorvo also offers components and full system solutions that incorporate Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, Thread and now Matter. Matter is a recently launched technology overlay, essentially a common language that improves interoperability across smart home devices regardless of protocol or manufacturer. It is supported by iOS, Android and major smartphone platform providers and it's widely expected to simplify and accelerate the adoption of smart home devices. It is also early days for our force-sensing touch sensors. These are ultra-sensitive MEMS based sensors that enable new use cases and enhanced device functionality. We have broad engagements across automotive smart interiors, trackpads, true wireless headsets, smartphones, wearables and other consumer applications and our opportunities are expanding, as customers engage with our technology and develop new use cases. Looking at ACG, fewer than half of the Android smartphones this year will be 5G. Android 5G units are expected to grow in the low double-digits for several years. That's a big growth opportunity for Qorvo as we move from very little content in 4G phones to significant dollar content in 5G phones. Another driver is 5G Advanced which leverages new releases of the 5G standard. 5G Advanced smartphones will include additional transmit and receive and satellite bands favoring Qorvo's product and technology portfolio. 5G will migrate to 5G Advanced over time and bridge us to new development efforts and new content required to accommodate 6G frequency spectrum at the end of the decade. Big picture, Qorvo enjoys a range of opportunities supported by multi-year upgrade cycles. Many of these transitions are very early on and Qorvo is recognized by customers as a leading technology innovator. We've made great progress developing new technologies and winning customer designs. With that said, we want to make it clear that our end markets have not yet turned and our outlook does not contemplate a significant change in the macro-economic environment. The customer demand environment for Qorvo is more a reflection of strong design win activity and the early actions we took to improve channel inventory. When end markets recover, that will represent an additional driver of growth for Qorvo. Now, let's turn to some quarterly highlights. In defense and aerospace, we increased shipments of X-Band transmit and receive FEMs and secured first orders for our 50-watt PAs in support of new LAN-based C-band radar programs. We introduced the world's highest power Ku-band satellite communications amplifier, which enables an 80% size reduction and is optimized for multiple applications. We also received a large production order for recently launched cell-to-satellite solutions. These solutions incorporate advanced technologies from across our aerospace, base station and mobile portfolios to enable low-earth-orbit satellite connectivity. In infrastructure, we were selected by Tier-1 base station OEM to supply switch LNA modules for next-generation 5G massive MIMO radios. We also continue to lead DOCSIS 4.0 broadband upgrade cycle with production orders from multiple customers and broad-based design wins. For power management markets, we released QSPICE, a significant improvement over current industry offerings for analog and mixed-signal circuit design in simulation. QSPICE improves the speed, functionality and reliability of circuit simulation, extending the value Qorvo is providing designers. Since its launch, the tool has surpassed 15,000 unique downloads. In automotive applications, we were selected to support a major in-vehicle car access platform by a leading German automotive Tier-1. This multiyear program has a lifetime value over $250 million, marking a major milestone for our ultra-wideband portfolio. Within this program, Qorvo will supply ultra-wideband solutions for in-vehicle applications for a leading German automotive OEM. We also secured a design win from another leading German automotive Tier-1 to supply V2X solutions for communications platform launching this year. Lastly, we were selected to supply forced sensing touch sensors that enhance smart interior functionality and a recently launched EV from a Korean based automotive OEM. Complementing the large ultra-wideband win in automotive, Qorvo was selected by the leading Android smartphone OEM to supply ultra-wideband for their Spring 2024 flagship launch. It's worth noting that the ultra-wideband wins in automotive and Android markets are significant as these two customers represent the largest volume opportunities in their respective markets. To extend our reach, we're sampling ultra-wideband solutions across fleet management, logistics, agriculture and other applications, leveraging our precision location capabilities to advance operational efficiencies. In Wi-Fi, we secured multi-year design wins with Tier-1 network operators in US and in India. These wins support next-generation wireless infrastructure for retail, enterprise and home applications. Across the Android ecosystem, we increased shipments of our highly integrated modules in support of Android smartphones from the high tier through the mass market. Notably, we extended our strong share position with the leading Android smartphone OEM in their flagship smartphone. In addition to the ultra-wideband win, we are also selected to supply the low-band, mid-high band, ultra-high band, secondary transmit receive, tuning and Wi-Fi. Lastly, we expanded customer sampling of our recently launched mid-high band pad. Qorvo's newest integrated architecture leverages next-generation BAW and SAW technologies and advanced packaging to combine main path content with receive paths commonly included in the diverse receive modules. This and other highly integrated Qorvo architectures for the Android ecosystem, free board space and improve efficiency to support future 5G form factors and content like flip and fold architectures and transmit and receive non-terrestrial network connectivity. I want to thank the Qorvo team for continued operational excellence. We have moved aggressively to reduce channel inventories by securing broad-based customer design wins. In the December quarter, our outlook reflects the seasonal profile of a large smartphone customer ramp as well as healthier channel inventories across most markets. In the March quarter, we expect revenue to be more closely aligned with end-market demand. Longer-term, we expect revenue, growth and margin expansion and product mix favors our higher growth investment business. And with that, I'll hand the call off to Grant.\nGrant Brown: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 47.6%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.39, all exceeding the high end of our August guidance. Revenue increased approximately 70% sequentially and benefited from significant content gains at our largest customer. Consistent with our guidance, factory production levels improved but remained below historical averages. During the quarter, the impact from underutilization and factory-related variances was approximately 550 basis points versus approximately 800 basis points last quarter. The increase in gross margin above the high end of our August guidance range was largely the result of revenue upside and product mix. A larger portion of September revenue was manufactured at external silicon foundries and processed at third-party OSAPs. By comparison, our December and March revenue will reflect a larger percentage of higher cost inventories manufactured internally during periods of lower utilization and a lower percentage of products manufactured at external silicon foundries and OSATs. Beyond this fiscal year, we continue to see a clear path back to 50% plus gross margin initially during specific quarters and then on a full year basis. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $246 million, slightly higher than our guidance due to performance-based incentive compensation. We are investing in new product development and targeting multi-year growth opportunities across all three segments. In addition to growth-oriented investments, we're also investing in enterprise-wide productivity initiatives. These multi-year efforts will support future growth and enhance profitability as we upgrade, modernize, and standardize around the latest tools and best practices. In total, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $279 million for 25% of sales, which increased from 7.2% last quarter. Breaking out operating margin by each segment, ACG was 34%, HPA was 17%, and CSG was negative 27%, which includes the impact of the biotechnology division. During the quarter, Qorvo Biotechnologies generated $0.5 million in revenue and reduced operating income by approximately $7 million. Just following quarter-end, we successfully closed the sale of the Omnia Biotechnology business, and will continue to sell BAW filters to support the acquirer. Non-GAAP net income was $236 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $2.39. Moving on to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow was $64 million, and CapEx was $29 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million worth of shares at approximately $103 per share. The rate and pace of our repurchases is based on our long-term outlook, free cash flow, low leverage, alternative uses of cash, and other factors. Turning to the balance sheet. At the quarter-end, we had approximately $2 billion of debt outstanding with no near-term maturities and $707 million of cash and equivalents. Consistent with our expectations and commentary from the prior earnings call, our net inventory balance was reduced in the period and ended the quarter at $840 million, down $78 million sequentially. Looking at days of inventory, this represents a decrease from 210 days to 138 days. Turning to our current quarter outlook, we expect revenue of approximately $1 billion plus or minus $25 million, non-GAAP gross margin between 43% and 44%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.65 at the midpoint of the revenue range. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter will be $235 to $240 million. Below the operating income line, non-operating expense is expected to be approximately $10 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal â€˜24 is expected to be within a range of 13% to 15%. We expect our inventory balance will decrease again in the December quarter. In terms of channel inventory, the environment continues to improve, with Android OEMs indicating inventory levels are approaching historical norms. Outside of the Android ecosystem, there are smaller pockets of channel inventory that will take longer to digest. We continue to forecast fiscal â€˜24 revenue above fiscal â€˜23. For the full fiscal year, fiscal â€˜24 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 44% or slightly better, with variability primarily tracking utilization and mix. Qorvo enjoys multi-year growth drivers across all three of our operating segments. We offer a broad portfolio of technologies and capabilities, and we are uniquely positioned across leading customers and large markets. We expect continued strength on large customer programs, and we are investing to drive outsized growth in diverse businesses to broaden our market exposure and accelerate growth. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tim Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is [Iman] (ph) jumping in for Tim. Just looking into fiscal 2025, I actually think about the trajectory of gross margin as utilization starts to come back, is there a certain level of revenue we should be thinking about for our core loan to be back at that 50% range?\nGrant Brown: Sure, I'll take that. This is Grant. Thanks for the question. There are a large number of factors that can influence gross margins such as revenue mix and input costs including utilization impacts. So I wouldn't think of it in terms of an absolute revenue level. Some products carry a higher gross margin than others due to the nature of that business or end market. For instance, looking at our base station product line, which is generally accretive to gross margins, but with base station demand weaker, coupled with the excess channel inventories we've been talking about there, this is currently a headwind to margin versus historical levels. Product mix can also impact gross margin based on where it's manufactured. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for instance, last quarter we shipped a higher portion of products that were manufactured at external silicon foundries and processed at third-party OSATs, and those products are not impacted by our internal factory utilization, which as we've mentioned, is running below historical averages. Aside from product mix, unit cost is the other half of the equation. It's a bit more complex given that input costs can affect gross margin on a lagging or leading basis. For example, historical underutilization will create higher unit costs in that inventory and as it's sold in future period, that impact lags. Alternatively, in anticipation of lower future demand, production volumes can be cut and utilization will fall. And in that sense, the impact tends to lead those anticipated changes in demand. So there's a number of factors that impact gross margin. I, again, wouldn't think of it in terms of an absolute revenue level, but rather a time of us to move through our high-cost inventory, return utilization levels back to normal, run the factories efficiently, and we'll be on a path back to 50% plus.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: The Next question comes from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Hi, guys. I wanted to pick up, Grant, with your detailed response to the last question. I know in your prepared remarks you said gross margin throughout fiscal year â€˜25 will, at times, be above 50%. So I presume that would be in your seasonally strong periods. And -- but did you say that as well 50% or above is the target for the full year or just the specific few quarters of seasonal [peakness] (ph)?\nGrant Brown: Sure. I said that I think it will achieve 50% on a specific quarter before it achieves 50% across the whole year. And that's somewhat macro dependent and obviously the volumes will dictate at what levels we return to a utilization where that's possible.\nGary Mobley: Okay. And, Bob, you mentioned, I think, in describing the fourth quarter of this year in line with market conditions. And so your full year guidance implies no more than a 10% sequential revenue decline in the fourth quarter. So how would you call the seasonal trends in the fourth quarter? Are we talking about mid-single-digit, I think which is usual, or perhaps as much as double-digit percent declines?\nBob Bruggeworth: Sure, Gary. I'll talk to -- at least the high level, just make sure we're clear on what we typically see in the fourth quarter, which as we've said all along, typical anymore isn't typical because it seems every time we're faced with something different from losing our second largest customer to COVID hits to various economic factors. What my comments were around is, given the current economic outlook, we're not expecting our markets to rebound. And as we work through all this general inventory that we talked about, we're going to hit the, what we think is the end market demand. Now, end market demand typically, and what we're forecasting now is -- what we see is our largest customer's rent continues to come down in March. We have a seasonal, usually the weakest quarter for our China Android business in March, and some of that is offset by a ramp at the largest Android customer that we have. So, as far as percentages go, I'm not going to call percentages, I'm just telling you that from our view, that's the dynamics that are driving most of our business. We -- Grant commented that our ACG business is growing year-over-year. Our CSG business will start growing this quarter and will be up in March. And really the lagging business for us is our HPA business and we've talked about what's going on there with primarily what used to be our largest business in the infrastructure side and we're not seeing that now. So when you integrate all that, we're still comfortable we're going to be up significantly in March year-over-year, and we're comfortable we're going to be up for the fiscal year â€˜24 over â€˜23. I don't know, Grant, if you want to add anything to that, while Iâ€™ve given all the moving pieces.\nGrant Brown: Sure. No, I think you covered it, Bob. I'd say, maybe 10%, but certainly not 15%, right? We're committed to the comments, any macro-related disruptions aside, that we see growth in fiscal â€˜24.\nOperator: The next question comes from Karl Ackerman of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. I have a clarification and a follow-up. I guess, just given the content gains in your largest customer, is it fair to say that customer now exceeds 50% of your revenue in the quarter?\nGrant Brown: We won't comment on any customers within the quarter, but we'll sum it up on the 10-K. The only thing I'd say about 10% plus customers is that we did have more than one in the quarter.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you for that. For my follow up, MediaTek suggested that 5G units should grow double-digits next year, certainly above overall smartphone unit expectations of low singles. Most of your exposure to incremental gains in 5G do come from China Android OEMs. I was hoping you could address how you think Huawei does or does not impact your China Android opportunity, both near-term and longer-term? Thank you.\nBob Bruggeworth: I'll take the first part of that, Karl, and I'll let Dave take the second part since he was just recently in China. Actually, a large part of our growth for 5G Android is still at the largest Android manufacturer being Samsung. The second point I would like to make is, you're right, we do have China exposure in 5G, but most of that is actually in the export market for what they're trying to do to build their brands outside of China. So just keep those two facts in mind. Dave was just in China just a couple weeks ago, and I'll let him talk a little bit more about that and what [at least] (ph) we're seeing, talking to all of our customers there, along with your comment about Huawei.\nDave Fullwood: Yeah, thanks, Bob. And so, maybe I'll start with Huawei and kind of size what we're seeing for you. And prior to the ramp of the new phone that they just announced, they were doing about 2 million units a month. And so we've seen a typical premium tier phone ramp where that peaked up. Last couple of weeks of data, we're actually seeing that come back down. So they may be on the other side of that ramp. But if you look at the incremental growth that we see over what they were shipping previously, it's -- on an annual basis, it's about 10 million to 20 million units. So that's a pretty good growth for that customer, but it's not that meaningful when you look at a total market size of about 1.2 billion smartphones per year. Now, when it comes to our China customers, as Bob said, a large part of their business and a lot of their growth is coming from overseas business and so we're very well represented across our China OEM customers and certainly in that overseas business, that's where we see a lot of the higher share and growth opportunities. So it's not just a China domestic situation that you have to look at. You have to look at that overseas business. And many of those customers have pretty significant market share in a lot of those overseas markets.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the China Android market. I guess specifically, what kind of trends did you see in the September quarter on a sequential basis? And what's embedded in your guidance for December? And related to that, we've been getting more questions about the competitive landscape in China. You guys have pretty good visibility and obviously you've got good relationships with your customers. As you think about models coming out in 2024, any concerns around market share, how should we think about gen-to-gen content growth, particularly as it pertains to your OEM's export business? Thanks.\nBob Bruggeworth: Dave, you want to handle that?\nDave Fullwood: Yeah, sure, Bob. Let's see, where to start. The China customer base in the export market as well as in the domestic market, they've got some pretty compelling products. As Bob said, I was just over there a few weeks ago, I got to meet with all of our customers. Our relationships continue to be very strong. They place a very high value on what we bring. And they all reinforce that Qorvo is their main global strategic supplier for RF. So we have deep discussions with them on roadmaps to align their needs to our product plans. And they're very highly engaged on our new low, mid, high S-PAD platform that we announced a couple quarters ago. Additionally, they're looking at expanding their business with us in other areas such as power management, sensors, and the L2 wideband. So the overall market, as Bob mentioned, the channel inventories are approaching normal, many of those customers are getting to pretty healthy levels. So as we've been saying all along, what was a headwind is now becoming a tailwind. So we're starting to see that growth. We had our largest bookings quarter in over two years. So our customers have now gotten past the concern about inventory and they're looking forward now and starting to place orders more aligned to what their true production plans and unit demand is. So that's certainly improved a lot. Now having said that, as Bob mentioned also, we're not anticipating any major rebound in the end market. We're just excited about the design wins that we've had and the inventory in the channel being cleared out and that's driving a lot of our growth as we go forward.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. And then as a quick follow up outside of mobile, some of your broader analog peers have talked about signs of weakness or clear signs of weakness in industrial and parts of automotive. I think comms infra has been weak for a couple of quarters now. But I guess the question is, outside of mobile, what kind of trends are you seeing, and what sort of trajectory are you assuming as you sort of progress through the December quarter and go into March outside of mobile? Thank you.\nGrant Brown: Sure, Toshiya, this is Grant. Let me take that one. We don't explicitly guide by segment, but the views for each of those businesses is factored into our total guidance. I'll try to provide you a little bit of color there and then Dave can jump in and add. We have a pretty diverse collection of businesses that serve a number of end markets, and they're not all in phase. As Bob pointed out last quarter in fiscal Q2, ACG returns to the year-over-year growth that we expected, and we'll continue to see that for the rest of the year. And then this quarter, our fiscal Q3, we forecast our CSG segment will return to year-over-year growth. And then finally, in Q4, we expect HPA to return to year-over-year growth. So the businesses are a bit out of phase, if you want to think of them that way. Just continuing with HPA as an example, directly to your question, if you look inside of HPA, there's various trends within each end market. It probably won't surprise you, but the base station market being weak, is an example. Our revenue is down over 50% year-over-year for the last four quarters. A few years ago, actually, we hit $200 million in that business before the Huawei ban and the 5G base station rollout slowed. But outside of China, only 25% of that mid-band 5G infrastructure has been built, so there's a lot of opportunity. But that's one area where we continue to see some meaningful headwind and market weakness. Beyond that though, there's also the broadband area within HPA. We have a very strong position there, high level of share, but the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade cycle may be a bit slower and there could be some pockets of inventory in the very end products there. So the situation within infrastructure is very different than, say, our defense and aerospace group where we're benefiting from significant strength and expect to grow in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. So, there's a lot of cross currents there when you get into the details, but this is why we maintain a diverse set of businesses. And a lot of them share the same manufacturing footprint, which creates the operating efficiencies, but also scale and the diversification on the top line.\nBob Bruggeworth: What I'll add to that is in the cellular IoT market, actually we saw this turn about two quarters ago down. So with CSG coming back, as Grant pointed out, growing next quarter, that's -- we're not expecting the IoT -- cellular IoT business to come back. That's been down for us and we've been working through inventory in that segment as well. So I think that's been some commentary as well.\nGrant Brown: Yeah, I think you mentioned automotive as well. And we're growing from a pretty small base there. So Bob talked about a lot of the design wins. We're pretty excited about the growth opportunity there. So that's all new programs. It'll be ramping over the next couple of years to help drive that growth for us. But it's coming off of a relatively small base. So we're not as exposed there to really maybe see some of the things you're seeing from some of our peers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ruben Roy of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRuben Roy: Yeah, hi, thank you. Bob, I wanted to ask about the ultra-wideband marketplace. I think in the past you've had a few system wins in the Android ecosystem for ultra-wideband. I don't know if they were characterized as flagship back then, so maybe if you could talk about the [roll-out] (ph) opportunity in smartphones specifically that you're seeing and then expanding outside of handset? Again, in the past I think you've characterized the market as several hundred million dollars of opportunity. You're talking about a $250 million lifetime opportunity in the auto win. So has anything changed? Are you seeing accelerating development? And if you can give us an update on how you characterize the opportunity, that'd be great.\nBob Bruggeworth: Sure. Thanks, Ruben. Extremely excited about what the team's accomplished and some big wins in ultra-wideband. One of the Android phone manufacturers, Google, we've been in for a couple generations now. So we've talked about that and that's -- you can get teardowns, I think from our comments who the next one is. What surprised us about ultra-wideband is, again, I think we said this a year ago or more than when we first acquired Decawave, that we were on the original platforms in our largest customers phones with the RF front-end for ultra-wideband. And what we believed was going to happen is it was going to take off in phones first and automotive second. What's actually happening is we're picking up a lot more in the automotive side and handset seems to be trailing it, at least in the adoption. Now, as you know, it takes a little bit longer to get to market in a car, so they're out winning platforms now and building those in. So our expectation is we're going to lead in design wins in automotive, but phones are going to come up fast. And Dave mentioned earlier in his comments that we're working with many of the other Chinese handset OEMs to introduce ultra-wideband. The thing I want to point out is in the Tier 1 German manufacturer that we won in, the current win is now to support a German Tier 1, but they will take that same platform to other US and other manufacturers around the world, that platform, plus we've been working with others on platforms that will also go into the automotive areas. So we see a lot of opportunity there. And placements in automotive can go from five or six up to nine or 10. So they can be big wins depending on how they adopt to use the ultra-wideband in a car. And it's more than just, â€˜keyless entry.â€™ And I think that's what's really exciting about the opportunities there. So if I look at that and I look at handset, also a couple quarters ago we talked about ultra-wideband and access points -- Wi-Fi access points for indoor navigation, which is another exciting opportunity. And we're just seeing it now going into other types of products, we're working with various manufacturers, OEMs, for other things in your home that need that kind of technology. So we're very excited about the things that are going on there. Really appreciate your question.\nRuben Roy: Thank you for all that detail, Bob. I have a quick follow-up for Grant. Just in terms of inventory, and I see the on-balance sheet inventory coming down, ahead of hopefully and potentially a growth year next year. Do you have sort of a target level either in DOI or dollar for inventory or how you're thinking about that as you go forward post December quarter?\nGrant Brown: Yeah, sure, and we usually have commented on our target around four turns. So high threes to four would be a pretty typical range for us to look to achieve.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.\nEdward Snyder: Thanks a lot. First, a housekeeping. Can you give us a percentage of revenue for each of the three businesses? Sorry, if I missed that. And then, Grant, if I take a look at your China revenue over the years, actually, it looks like if you exclude the arrow when you were over shipping and the arrow when you're under shipping, your average is probably close to $250 million to $300 million a quarter. And I know you did about $150 million last quarter. We haven't seen the [cadence] (ph) for September yet, but doesn't it suggest you're dealing with maybe $100 million, $150 million of inventory burn per quarter? I'm just trying to bracket those numbers.\nGrant Brown: Yeah. Sure, Ed. I can help you with the percent of revenue, but we haven't commented on the China revenue in the quarter. ACG was 77%. HPA was 14% and CSG was the balance of about 9%. And yeah, we haven't commented on what a normalized level of Android revenue or China revenue would be outside of the comments we've already made, but I don't know if there's...\nBob Bruggeworth: All we'd add is we are still under-shipping to end demand best we can tell. But we're coming up near the end of it.\nEdward Snyder: Right. But when it snaps back to something more normal, you said inventories are normalizing, and I know demand changes year-over-year, but given your kind of incumbent position as a preferred vendor for most of those phones being sold...\nBob Bruggeworth: Yeah. We've been -- and maybe this will help -- as we bring it down, that means revenues do go up. I mean, it's not -- we haven't been shipping. So we've been up the last two quarters.\nGrant Brown: Yeah. And maybe, Ed, I would also make the distinction between channel inventory and our own inventories. So channel inventories, we think, are relatively healthy, maybe even earlier than we had commented on in the past where we thought it would take until December. So that's an improving situation. Our own inventories as we're selling through them requires us to achieve the mix shift that we're going to see in the second half. So we'll start selling through our own high-cost inventories in Q3 and Q4 largely and we do expect growth in Q3.\nEdward Snyder: When you said you saw the largest bookings in two years in the last quarter and normally those bookings are for what, a year out or so, I know it varies, but...\nBob Bruggeworth: No, not a year ahead.\nEdward Snyder: Yeah.\nBob Bruggeworth: Normal lead times for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Srini Pajjuri of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Just a clarification on the China business, either Bob or Grant. I think one of the comments is that, yeah, the inventories are coming down and businesses from the trough levels is growing sequentially. But at the same time, I think, Bob, you said in your comments about the March quarter, you're expecting China to be seasonal. Given that inventories have kind of pretty much normalized, I would have thought China would be better than seasonal in March. So just if you can give some clarification on why it will only be seasonal in March?\nBob Bruggeworth: Because what I meant was from a demand perspective, in March, that's typically a seasonally low point for China. That's what I said.\nSrini Pajjuri: Okay. But, doesn't mean that your business is going to decline seasonally in March quarter -- your China business?\nBob Bruggeworth: What I also said is we've come -- we pretty much cleared out most of the inventory. So we are seeing growth, which is what I just said to Ed this quarter in our Android business in China.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Got it.\nGrant Brown: Yeah. Maybe I'll restate what Bob had commented on earlier. Just in terms of next quarter, we do see growth in Android. But March, we do expect to see the typical decline there, which is on the other side of our largest customer's ramp and March is also historically a seasonally low point for handset sales in China. So those two factors are somewhat offset by the largest Android customer and their timing of phone launches, plus the fact that the channel is healthier. So with all that said, we do think it will be better than typically seasonal. But again, it's anyone's guess as to what seasonality means.\nBob Bruggeworth: Our largest customer has the largest impact on March. So let's see how their sales do.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Got it. Makes sense. And then this year has been in terms of the content expansion for you, Bob, it's been pretty impressive. And I think some of those content gains also came from share gains. So as you look out to the next six to 12 months, how are you feeling about, because I do get this question about sustainability of some of the content gains from this year. So if you could help us maybe to the extent you have visibility, how should we think about your content gains both in premium as well as in the mid-tier.\nBob Bruggeworth: Yeah. I can speak to the high-end phones. And I'll start with our largest customer because it's been questioned before. But our growth this year and our largest customer really speaks to the strong position we have there, and we are one of their trusted suppliers as well as the investments we've been making to deliver them these great technologies and products. This year, we grew mostly from new content and gained some share in sockets that we held for many years. So we feel good about that. Now remember, they are a performance-driven customer. We're winning where we're bringing strong capabilities and have consistently done well. Now if you look at the available TAM there, we remain underrepresented. So clearly, that's a target of growth for us, and we'll continue to invest to be able to win there. Now that's also regardless of the baseband they decide to use. We enjoy multiple opportunities to grow our content not only in the areas where we've been strong in the past, but also in areas that will be new sockets for Qorvo. Again, that's about our largest customer. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the leading Android smartphone manufacturer and our ability to continue to gain share there. and we talked about ultra-wideband along with all those types of components. Dave also spoke about in China and bring out our new technologies where we've integrated the mid-high band plus the diversity received into that module. That's going to be the ability to grow there as well. Dave also talked about ultra-wideband in some of those handsets, some of our sensors, power management. So I think as we look across the portfolio, we feel pretty good at our ability to continue to grow our dollar content in handsets whether it's a flagship premium tier or the mass market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my questions. For the first one, you were guiding December sales down 9% sequentially or so. I thought the original intention was to kind of stay flattish. The large customer, I imagine, should be flattish. And I think one of your competitors mentioned a sharp ramp in terms of their China shipments getting into December. So I'm curious, Bob, what is leading you to kind of guide sales down when some of these big customer trends seem to be growing sequentially? Or is it just conservatism? Or is it noncellular market that's guiding that outlook?\nBob Bruggeworth: Thanks, Vivek. And I know I've said this before, but I'll remind you and the audience, we ship a majority of our parts that are not on the motherboard. So the timing of when we see the ramp is different than maybe you're talking about a baseband customer, I don't know. They're on the motherboard. A lot of what we have goes to the flex circuits. So they build those ahead of the motherboard. So our timing can be different. So I just want to make sure that. That's also, if it's the baseband customer, if you remember, they had an inventory build that they blamed at that customer. We didn't see that build. So therefore, we naturally follow the progression of the builds. They may have had a pause. And as you point out, the inventory will go down, then they would see a quick ramp up. So I can't comment on their business, but I can tell you the timing, we typically lead the ramp because of how much product we have on flex circuits, which is different than most of the products that are on the motherboard.\nGrant Brown: Maybe, Vivek, I'll just pick up from there. In terms of our prior discussion around the December quarter, the flat comment was relative to $1 billion Q2, and we've just exceeded that by $100 million. So to Bob's point on timing, plus or minus a couple of weeks that our largest customer can make a very big difference. But those two quarters combined are still ahead of where we were communicating previously. So on the net, a positive trend in the top line.\nVivek Arya: Got it. Makes sense. And then on gross margins. So December, 43.5%, I guess, at midpoint. March, I guess, seem to be implying closer to 41%. And I think the explanation you're giving is that because these two quarters, you are using your internal high cost inventory. So does that impact get over by March as we start conceptually thinking about modeling gross margins from June onwards. What is that starting baseline that we should keep in mind? Is it low 40s? Is it mid-40s? I understand you're not going to give guidance for next year, but I just don't know how to think about what is normalized gross margins as we start thinking about your next fiscal year?\nGrant Brown: Sure. And, now some of this depends on the inventory, as you pointed out, that we're carrying the high unit cost inventory that we sell through and the mix of that in the March quarter. Some of this also relates to the utilization within the March period as we start to look forward to the demand that we see in the coming year. So it's a difficult or complex question to answer prospectively. But nonetheless, in terms of the gross margin for the March quarter, as I mentioned, our full year guide of 44% and now saying a bit better than that could imply that we have upside to the March to what you've just described. And then in terms of our fiscal '25, it's going to be a gradual continuation from there upwards, I would expect, because the June quarter is still seasonally weaker for us as we head into the larger ramp in September from a seasonal perspective. So hopefully, that gives you at least some idea of how we're going to track into fiscal '25. Maybe going back to some of my prepared remarks, I did say that I believe we could achieve 50% gross margin at first on a quarterly basis and then subsequently on an annual basis across an entire year when we get through the inventory as well as return utilization levels to more normalized levels.\nOperator: The next session comes from Chris Caso of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you, good evening. The question is on cash flow and on your ability to start ramping the cash flow again once the market comes to a fuller recovery? I suppose that's going to depend a lot on what the CapEx needs are and for how long. And so if you could talk about that, the kind of expectations for cash flow and for how long you can kind of keep the CapEx at lower levels, so you can drive some cash in the next cycle.\nGrant Brown: Sure. So obviously, we'd expect cash flow to improve materially given the improvement in the P&L. It's a bit of a lagging indicator as we collect receivables. So we should see that. I wouldn't expect anything different in terms of our guidance on CapEx at around 5% of sales or less. Again, that can fluctuate, of course, but I wouldn't expect too much difference there from a free cash flow perspective.\nChris Caso: Okay. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, if you could talk about the competitive environment some and one of the things that was noted with the Huawei phone that came out as there was some Chinese RF there, and it's a very different architecture from the phones that you're supplying into your China customers. But I guess the question is, are you seeing anything different with regard to the capabilities of some of the local Chinese suppliers that would have some effect on the market?\nDave Fullwood: Yeah. I think from a capability standpoint, I mean, we don't see anything out of the norm. I mean there's certainly some key technology areas that they're definitely behind in. And so -- and I think if you look across the phone, even outside of the RF, there's probably a lot of areas that the technologies behind and maybe even up to years behind. So I think from a competitive environment, we don't see any big change just because of that Huawei phone ramp.\nOperator: The next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. And I apologize if you said this earlier. But in terms of the September quarter, mobile came in a bit better than you were expecting. I believe the expectation was that you weren't going to see much Android growth. Can you just clarify if that upside came from Android to your largest customer? And I don't know if you gave the percentage [of two 10%] (ph) customers? So are you willing to give those out?\nGrant Brown: Yeah. Thanks, Blayne. This is Grant. No, we didn't give out the percentages. We'll do that annually, but I just did mention that we had two. In terms of the quarter, the upside in revenue was largely driven by ACG and it was predominantly our largest customer, but not entirely so.\nBlayne Curtis: Got you. And then I wanted to ask, just follow back up on that gross margins. I'm trying to understand, I guess, your mix has shifted dramatically to this largest customer, and I'm just trying to figure out if that, how much of an effect does that have on your gross margins, the customer mix versus the utilization of your fabs? Does that have any impact or not?\nGrant Brown: Yeah, sure. So maybe if we just look at bridging Q1 to Q2, so there is 470 basis points of improvement there sequentially. Of that, maybe 2.5% was moving from the 800 basis points of underutilization to 550 basis points. So there's 2.5% and that was largely anticipated in the guidance of 45% to 46% for Q2. And then that leaves a little over 200 basis points left. Now that included some quality and other items, but it was primarily the product mix that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, where we are producing that product on silicon foundries outside of Qorvoâ€™s factory network and then processing them at OSATs that are third parties. So, that doesn't carry the same burden as the higher cost inventory we'll be selling in the second half.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nBob Bruggeworth: We want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your interest in Qorvo and we look forward to speaking with you at upcoming investor events. Thanks and have a great night.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Douglas DeLieto, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. DeLieto. You may begin.\nDouglas DeLieto: Thanks very much. Hello, everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provided supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Grant Brown, CFO; Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Thanks, Doug, and welcome everyone to Qorvo's fiscal 2024 first quarter call. Revenue, margin and EPS were all above the midpoint of the outlook we provided on our May 3rd earnings call. End market demand in the June quarter was consistent with our expectations. Within the Android ecosystem, channel inventories continue to be consumed and Qorvo continue to undership to end market demand. We expect continued reduction in channel inventories in the September quarter and we see Android channel inventories normalizing by calendar year end. In other markets, relative strength in the areas like defense and aerospace and automotive was offset by inventory consumption across consumer markets and weak demand in 5G infrastructure. In some of these markets, we expect inventory consumption to extend into next year. Qorvo has worked diligently since last fall to aggressively drive down channel inventories in multiple markets while at the same time prioritizing new product development and securing customer designs. This has enabled us to drive growth in large customer programs and it positions Qorvo for incremental growth as end markets recover. As we have stated in the past, Qorvo's growth targets by segment or for strong double-digit growth in Connectivity and Sensors, double-digit growth in High-Performance Analog and mid-to-high single-digit growth in Advanced Cellular. Design wins during the quarter in HPA were diversified across customers and markets and included large defense programs extending multiple years. In Connectivity and Sensors, design activity span a variety of applications including highly-integrated IoT connectivity solutions, Wi-Fi 7 RF front ends and force-sensing touch sensors. We have a broad range of growth drivers in CSG and we are pleased with our increasing design activity in new growth areas like Sensors and ultra-wideband. Overtime, we see HPA and CSG contributing increasingly to growth, diversification and margin expansion. In Advanced Cellular, design activity continued to be favorable across all leading smartphone OEMs. We are growing our content and next-generation 5G smartphones at our largest customers and we are capturing new content in the Android ecosystem as 4G units transition to 5G and enter our SAM. In calendar 2023, approximately 45% of Android smartphones will be 5G and we expect Android 5G smartphone unit growth to post double-digit CAGR for several years. Now let's turn to some quarterly highlights. In automotive applications, Qorvo was selected by an automotive tier-one to supply ultra-wideband connectivity for upcoming EV launch by US-based manufacturer. We are pleased with this win and the growing content opportunity in automotive where the ultra-wideband content inside the car will typically include five to seven placements plus one placement in each key fob. We also secured touch sensor design wins enabling force level detection in a range of smart interior applications including center console, door panel, steering wheel and display. These are multiple design wins totaling multiple billions of dollars. In Automotive Connectivity, we were selected by a leading automotive antenna supplier to provide cellular V2X front end modules and BAW coexistence filters for use by a major European-based OEM. Lastly, we expanded our automotive footprint with an automotive radar design win to supply or receive amplifier for a major US-based automotive OEM. Qorvo's automotive opportunities include DC to DC converters, onboard chargers, smart interiors, RF front ends for 5G, Wi-Fi and V2X connectivity, radars and ultra-wideband secure car access for key fobs and in sidecars. In Wi-Fi, we secured several Wi-Fi 7 design wins with access point providers for our Wi-Fi 7 BAW filters enabling full coverage of 2.4 gigahertz, 5 gigahertz, and 6 gigahertz bands. We also began sampling tier-one customers for our next-generation Wi-Fi 7 FEMs which paired with multiple chipsets. In our Connectivity Systems business, we were among the first to achieve Matter 1.1 certification for our concurrent connect integrated solutions for gateways and devices. This expands our market opportunity and support of top smart home ecosystem customers whose installed base exceeds $150 million home networks. In silicon carbide, we booked a multi-million dollar customer order for silicon carbide power devices supporting AI servers in other data center applications. Design win funnel for Qorvo's silicon carbide power devices is increasing and we continue to expand our supply base to support our customers. In addition to the previously announced supply agreement with SK Siltron, we also have agreements in place with Wolfspeed and Coherent. For broadband applications, we extended our leadership in DOCSIS 4.0 with customer sampling of our 1.8 gigahertz hybrid power doubler. This solution delivers more RF power with lower-power consumption than competing solid-state solutions. In Cellular Infrastructure, we released a highly-integrated 3.4 gigahertz to 3.8 gigahertz, 8W PAM that simplifies 5G massive MIMO system design. We also began sampling the industry's first C-band discrete BAW band pass filter for 5G small cell radios. For defense communications, we began sampling the industry's first 2 gigahertz to 18 gigahertz transmit receive front end module, delivering 10W of transmit power. This highly-integrated wideband solution integrates the PA, switch, LNA and Limiter. It leverages Qorvo's advanced packaging and process technologies to maximize power efficiency in a miniaturized footprint. The form factor and functional density of our solution is especially critical given the trend in our defense and aerospace business of one-to-many. In addition to manned aircraft, there will be many more drones. In addition to large keyhole satellites, there will be many more LEO satellites. These future communication systems and system upgrades incorporate more electronics requiring greater integration across higher volumes. With smartphone OEMs, we began sampling Android smartphone customers, Qorvo's newest highly integrated PAD, which combines in a single placement below, mid and high-band main path functionality that is currently offered in two placements. This new architecture reduces surface area by 40% to meaningfully simplify design and decrease time-to-market for massive 5G phones. This follows on the heels of our announcement last quarter that we began sampling a mid, high-band PAD that combines the main path and diversity receive content for the mid and high bands. Both placements leverage a broad range of Qorvo process technologies, including our newest BAW and SAW filters. Lastly, we commenced customer sampling of our next-generation antenna tuners, which deliver best-in-class linearity, the industry's smallest solution size and compatible with all major chipsets. I want to thank the Qorvo team for continued operational excellence. We have made significant progress clearing channel inventories while developing new technologies and securing new design wins that enhance our customers' products and expand our addressable market. In the September quarter, our outlook primarily reflects new products ramping at our largest customer. Later in the year, we expect Android revenues to reflect a healthier channel in Qorvo's shipments that are more closely aligned with end-market demand. We are very encouraged by customer design activity we've seen so far this year, we expect revenue growth and margin expansion as product mix favors our high growth investment businesses and we are positioned for incremental growth as end markets recover. And with that I'll hand the call off to Grant.\nGrant Brown: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $651 million, non-GAAP gross margin was 42.9% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.34. Relative to our expectations as provided on our May earnings call, results exceeded the midpoint of guidance despite the macro-environment and channel inventory reduction efforts. Consistent with our guidance, factory production levels improved modestly, but remain below which created an underutilization impacts during the quarter of approximately 800 basis points. The sequential improvement in gross margin and upside to the midpoint of our guidance was due to higher production levels and product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $233 million approximately in line with our expectations. We continue to invest in new product development that targets multi-year growth opportunities across all three segments as well as in the teams that directly support our customers. In total, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $47 million or 7% of sales, which increased modestly relative to last quarter. Breaking out operating margin by each segment, ACG was 11%, HPA was 17% and CSG was negative 20%. During the quarter, Qorvo Biotechnologies reduced CSG operating income by approximately $2 million. As a reminder, we are currently in the process of seeking strategic alternatives for this business. Non-GAAP net income was $34 million representing diluted earnings per share of $0.34. Moving onto the cash flow statement. Free cash flow was $5 million and capital expenditures were $39 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million worth of shares at an average price of $96.81. The rate and pace of our repurchases is based on our long-term outlook, free cash flow, low leverage, alternative uses of cash and other factors. Turning to the balance sheet. As of quarter-end, we had approximately $2 billion of debt outstanding with no near-term maturities and $744 million of cash and equivalents. Cash benefited from the sale of our Farmers Branch campus, which was completed during the quarter. Consistent with our expectations and commentary from our prior earnings call, our net inventory balance ended the quarter was up $121 million to $917 million driven by the seasonal ramp at our largest customer. Turning to our current quarter outlook, we expect quarterly revenue of approximately $1 billion plus or minus $15 million, non-GAAP gross margin between 45% and 46% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.75 at the midpoint of the revenue range. Our outlook contemplates the current demand environment, further consumption of channel inventory and seasonal factors. Our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q2 excludes any costs related to the divestiture of the Biotech business but includes ongoing operating expenses until it has divested. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the September quarter will be approximately $240 million. In addition to growth-oriented investments across our product and technology portfolios, we are also targeting enterprise-wide productivity initiatives. We're simplifying and rationalizing processes and upgrading the core systems we use to run the business. We will present these productivity investments as non-GAAP other operating expenses. These multiyear efforts will support future growth and enhanced profitability as we upgrade, modernize and standardize around the latest tools and best practices. Below the operating income line, non-operating expense is expected to be approximately $10 million, reflecting the interest paid on our fixed-rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. Our non-GAAP tax-rate for fiscal '24 is expected to be within a range of 13% to 15%. We expect our inventory balance will decrease in the September quarter as we support a seasonal ramp at our largest customer. In terms of channel inventory, the environment continues to improve. Inventories of our components in the Android channel were reduced during the June quarter by approximately 20%. This follows greater than 20% reductions in the prior two quarters. We anticipate channel inventories will continue to decline this quarter. Later this calendar year, we expect Android channel inventories will normalize. Outside of the Android ecosystem, there are smaller pockets of channel inventory. They will take longer to digest. For the full year, there is no change to the full fiscal '24 commentary provided last quarter. To reiterate, we forecast fiscal '24 revenue will be above fiscal '23 and expect to benefit from strong dollar content growth at our largest customer. For the full year fiscal '24 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 44% with variability on a quarterly basis primarily tracking utilization and mix. During the second half of the fiscal year, we expect sequential declines in gross margin during Q3 and again in Q4, primarily related to utilization and mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q3 and Q4 are expected to be approximately $240 million to $245 million per quarter with variability related to the timing of product development spend, investments in core systems and related productivity initiatives, incentive compensation based on our expectations for improved financial performance, the timing of the Biotechnology business disposition as well as other items. Qorvo enjoys multiyear growth drivers across our three segments. We are leveraging a broad portfolio of technologies and capabilities to grow content this year on large customer programs and we are uniquely positioned across leading customers in large markets. We're investing to drive outsized growth in diverse businesses to broaden our market exposure and accelerate growth. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yeah, thank you. Two questions if I may gentlemen. First, could you comment on your ability to secure gallium and germanium substrates for your products? And I guess what are your thoughts on the ability to pass along higher substrate costs if that were to occur going forward?\nGrant Brown: Sure. Thanks for the question, Karl. This is Grant. We currently do not believe the export ban will have a meaningful near-term impact. It took effect yesterday, as you know, but it was communicated well in advance and I credit our ops and sales team for acting quickly to access the supply needs and communicate with customers and suppliers, and ultimately for increasing our raw material coverage with our direct suppliers wherever needed but we have not observed any notable changes in our customers' behavior or supplier lead times. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and they have assured us of their ability to support our demands down to individual purchase orders on committed delivery dates. In terms of pricing, we had again, haven't seen anything abnormal there as of today.\nKarl Ackerman: Very helpful. I guess, if I could just maybe zoom out for a second. I was hoping you could -- you could discuss the timing of the automotive design wins you've mentioned in your prepared remarks across many applications really, silicon carbide, ultra-wideband, force-sensing. My understanding was that automotive represented kind of a mid-single-digit portion of your sales. I could be wrong, but that clearly appears to be expanding. So could you comment and whether maybe your automotive business doubles for you by 2025? Thanks.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Thanks, Karl. This is Bob. Appreciate the question. As you well know, the nice thing about automotive is when you win, you get great visibility for multiple years, unlike the smartphone industry where today we get a little bit of visibility, but you have to then earn it the following models, where in automotive, as you pointed out, you go out several years. We've got great visibility at this time, we're not sizing it, but I think based on the volume of opportunities that we shared in my prepared remarks plus in the press release, it is our expectations as you pointed out, as we move out into calendar year '25 and '26, it will become a much more meaningful part of our business. But as you pointed out, we're already participating in some of the automotive applications today. I will comment the electric vehicle manufacturers do seem to move a little bit more, a little bit faster than the traditional gas engine manufacturers, but we do look forward to continue to report our progress.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.\nRuben Roy: Thank you. Bob, if I can follow up, right where you left off on auto. Can you talk about or characterize the types of automobiles where you're winning? Is it sort of flagship versions or flagship autos or mid-tier high end or across the board? And at this point, is there a way to think about content per auto in dollars?\nRobert Bruggeworth: Sure. Thanks. I'm going to have Dave get into some of the details on that, Ruben?\nDave Fullwood: Yes, and you can imagine some of these products that we're talking about, they're going to start in a higher tier of the auto from ultra wideband for the sensors that are going into the cockpit. Electric vehicles certainly are focused there, but even some of the higher-end gas-powered vehicles. And over time, we expect that to go down market. On some of the connectivity side there, that can go more broadly across the portfolio and the OEMs because there you're talking about connectivity within the vehicle, connectivity from vehicles outside of the vehicle. So some of those are more driven by the governments, and those requirements are going to be across all vehicles regardless of the tier where that model sits.\nRuben Roy: Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up, Grant, I caught the operating margin numbers you gave for the segments. I don't know if I missed this, but I don't have it. Can you give us the dollars or kind of the performance for the segments in the June quarter? And then, obviously, you've got strong content gains at the largest customer driving, the September revenue expectation, but if you can give us any granularity on how you're thinking about the other segments as you proceed? Any changes to how you're thinking about those segments through the rest of the year? Thanks.\nGrant Brown: Sure, Ruben. Revenue by segment was $412 million for ACG, $140 million for HPA and $99 million for CSG. In ACG, our fiscal Q1 is the lowest seasonal point for those largest customers. But despite that, the top line for ACG was approximately flat or down about a percent or so. Both HPA and CSG saw sequential growth in the quarter, up 5% and 21% sequentially. As I commented in the prepared remarks, operating income was 11% just for ACG, 17% for HPA, and then negative 20% for CSG, which was a notable sequential improvement for CSG. We don't guide by segment, but looking out into September, the primary driver is the content gains at our largest customer within ACG. Revenue is not supported by existing inventory. It's built and shift in line with the seasonal ramp, so it's not burdened with those higher costs of some of the Android inventory, for example. So that benefits gross margin and has been factored into our, into our guidance.\nRuben Roy: Appreciate it.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Operator?\nGrant Brown: Operator, next question please.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Operator, are you there?\nOperator: This is the operator. Is the question over?\nRobert Bruggeworth: Yes, please. Next question please.\nOperator: Just a moment. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Hey, guys. Wasn't sure if was getting my question in. Good afternoon. I was observing that your first half of fiscal year '24 appears to be running about 3% above your -- your May commentary and -- or about $50 million. What's driving that minor variance and is there anything to call out that may be offsetting that?\nGrant Brown: Sure, thanks, Gary. Good. It's a good question. I think it's fair to say that the quarter played out better than we had forecast when we provided our May guidance. If you, if you look into that revenue, it was strength in the areas that we had, that we had talked about. So at our largest customer and then within having cleared some of the channel inventory, we're still benefiting to a modest degree there, but generally speaking, the quarter played out better. In terms of the drivers on maybe the EPS beat to go a little further than just revenue that was primarily gross margin improvement which was partially driven by the revenue upside, but was also a factor there of lower factory variances, including utilization, better utilization and continuing cost reduction efforts. Those were partially offset by some inventory-related charges and typical price erosion along with inflation. But generally speaking, the quarter was better than -- than we had forecasted in May.\nGary Mobley: Got it. Thanks, Grant. And so you're guiding the September quarter revenue at about $1 billion dollars, which takes us back to a similar level to the June quarter of fiscal year '23 when gross margins were 450 basis points higher. And I presume the difference today is that you would, you just have too much inventory and you just can't fully utilize the manufacturing operations. But under -- my question is under what circumstances can we see a return to that 50% gross margin?\nGrant Brown: Sure, we still have visibility to 50%. As I pointed out on the call, we have about 800 basis point headwind from utilization in the prior quarter and looking forward, we still have those same issues from a utilization perspective, as you pointed out on inventory. I think as we clear the channel inventory across the Android and utilization returns to a level in which we're shipping to end market demand, we should have a clear path back towards the 50% gross margins we've enjoyed in the past. Those are really two-fold, there's the inventory we have on hand, which is already burdened with the cost of that underutilization in the past. And then there is the forward-looking utilization within the current quarter as we meet future demand or build product for future demand. Both of those can weigh on the quarter and are in that 800 basis points that I quoted. The underutilization of current period can, if it's extreme, it can hit as period charges and we've experienced some of those as well. So it's really, as we re-synchronize our factories to end market demand, we should have a clear path back.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Bob, on the Android inventory, you seem pretty optimistic that it's going to normalize by end of the calendar year. So I guess as we look out to the March quarter and next calendar year, what's the, I guess, in the strategy for, I guess, whether you call it refilling the channel or maybe just trying to think about how the seasonality might get impacted once the inventory normalizes.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Thanks, Srini, for your question. And we are getting pretty comfortable with the progress we're making, and as both Grant and I have commented, the team has done a great job of managing the inventory down, working with our customers, working with some of our distributors to do that, and our expectations are that we should be able to, by the end of the calendar year, things will normalize. And then, obviously, as that happens, we're not expecting end demand to change at all from where we are. In fact, as we sit here today reporting the most recent quarter, and we were a quarter ago, our numbers for units of Android phones, smartphones has not changed. So we think things are stabilizing some. Yes, the market's been down here a little bit up there, but overall. So as we look out into '24, calendar '24, fiscal '25 for us, we're not ready to make any calls on what's going to happen with the macro economy and things like that. But clearly, as we've come down to normalized inventories, that headwind turns into a tailwind. So we'll watch how that plays out.\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes, that's great. And then maybe one for Grant. Grant, you kind of highlighted underutilization as one of the issues with the gross margin. But I guess the other issue is the high-cost inventory. So I guess at what point that stops to become a headwind to your gross margin and maybe potentially a tailwind.\nGrant Brown: Sure. We haven't commented beyond fiscal '24. So I won't do that here. But in our guidance, with a sequential drop in Q3, you start to see some improvement there. And then in Q4, again, you start to see even more improvement as we sell through some of the channel inventory. Now gross margin will be sequentially down in the sense that we're selling through some of that inventory, but we do expect to resynchronize utilization towards the end of our fiscal year and into fiscal '25. But we haven't commented specifically beyond that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Bob, you are sounding more confident about the top-line growth, but since the last time Qorvo reported, there has been kind of this pronounced slowdown in China. And even if the Android customer inventory might be getting cleaned up, your large customers still has China as an important end market. So, I'm curious that in the last call you suggested that December sales could be flattish, right, and March would be down just kind of seasonal, is that still the right way to think about December and March or do you think we should be reflecting any macro effects that we're seeing by way of sell-through and just consumer demand?\nGrant Brown: Thanks, Vivek. This is Grant. Let me take that one. Beyond the specific September quarter guidance that we just provided, there is no change to the fiscal '24 commentary that we provided last quarter. So as Bob pointed out, our expectations for sell-through and in the channel remain the same. Absent any macro-related disruptions, which we're not predicting, we do forecast to continue to think fiscal '24 revenue will be above fiscal '23 as you mentioned, and we're benefiting from some strong dollar content growth at our largest customer and then later in the year, we will benefit from the actions we've taken in connection with our customers to clear that channel inventory. To be clear, we are calling for very modest growth on the year, which is consistent. But in fact, our forecast does not anticipate a significant rebound in the Android units. The Qorvo specific situation as we process through the channel inventory and then return to shipping to end market demand. Beyond revenue just for the year, there's also no change to our fiscal '24 non-GAAP gross margin, still expected to be approximately 24% plus or minus with some variability on a quarterly basis tracking utilization and mix, which I've already talked about. This is important to understand. Mix will shift seasonally over fiscal Q3 and even more so in fiscal Q4 towards higher-cost inventories and utilization is also important, as I pointed out, because it supports that incremental forward-looking demand but also because severe underutilization can lead to the period costs as I mentioned earlier. We've been very transparent there and continue to expect those sequential declines in gross margin and that's factored into our 44% guide. I covered OpEx a bit in my prepared remarks but it's important to note that we are investing for the future. We're investing in large customer programs where we have the technologies to win. We're investing in diversifying businesses like silicon carbide, UWB, Matter, SoCs and power management. And finally, we're investing in ourselves by upgrading our core systems and numerous productivity initiatives. So on the whole, there is no change to our fiscal '24 guidance and our view of the market remains the same.\nVivek Arya: Thanks, Grant. Very helpful. And then on gross margins -- Apologize if you had answered this before, but again from the last call I think you had mentioned December could be down 100, 150 basis points, and then March would be down another 200 to 300 basis points as you work through some of the higher priced component inventory. What would make that component inventory cost go down, right? I imagine there has been more inflation overtime. So I guess this is just a long-winded way of asking that as we start the next fiscal year, what is the right baseline of gross margins we should think about, is it that 43%, 44% level as you're exiting March, is at the average level that you have in this fiscal year? What is the right way to just think about the baseline level of gross margin as you enter the next fiscal year?\nGrant Brown: Sure. I might think about it two different ways. I wouldn't characterize Q1 of fiscal '25 as baseline revenue, but I think it's appropriate to build off of what you are modeling in Q4 of fiscal '24, but we haven't provided explicit -- explicit guidance to that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is (Evan) [ph] calling in for Tim. I had just one question from me, just wanted to ask about the US phone market for iPhone has potentially changed the trajectory of the recovery on the Android side because I know that the iPhone market, the used phone market is going substantially. So I just wanted to try to get a sense for it if that sort of, like a headwind to the recovery on the Android side?\nGrant Brown: The iPhone refurbished market has been around for quite a long time. So at least when we model that coupled with everything else that we do in our normal research for phone usage, different segments, all those things that we feed into our model, we've taken all that into account for all the comments that we've made this evening, last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. So it's all in our calculus already.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thank you, guys. Good afternoon. There's a couple of calls going on at the same time, so I apologize if I missed a little, but guys I heard all the comments going into the back half of the year regarding inventory in the handset market and also your sales potentially getting better with the large customer. I wanted to ask on the Qualcomm guys mentioned tonight not having a license to ship into Huawei for 5G and there's some pretty well-documented reports about HiSilicon doing a modem with SMIC for some of those phones and it's uncertain about volumes, but could you guys tell us if you're -- would be allowed to participate in those handset builds, and if you have sort of export license to do so? Thanks.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Matt, thanks for the question. I don't believe there's any company in the USthat has a license to ship to Huawei for 5G phone. They become a very small customer of ours, so there's no real impact from that perspective. And as you pointed out, we'll see if they are successful or not, won't impact our business at this time.\nMatthew Ramsay: Got it. No, that was my assumption, but I had a few people ask me to clarify that. I guess as my follow-up. You guys have spent a lot of time talking about diversification of the company outside of the wireless market and it's not lost on us through the press release and some of your communications that the first bunch of bullets was about things in the auto market and in aerospace and defense and a bunch of markets, silicon carbide, a bunch of things outside of the handset market. But there's also been some pretty dynamic macroeconomic conditions in all of those markets as well, like, nothing is really immune from the macro. So maybe you guys could give us a little bit of an update outside of the handset market, how inventory for the company is overall. Customers in the channel. Are there any -- it's well-documented what the inventory headwinds are the gross margin and the recovery in your handset business and we all follow that closely, but are there anything that we should know about outside of the handset market from an inventory perspective where do you feel like things are relatively clean there? Thank you.\nGrant Brown: Sure. This is Grant. Let me take -- Maybe the two-part question and then I'll ask Dave to step in if I miss anything. The question about the growth drivers. If you look at or think about the phases of growth that we're looking at right now, you could -- as we've commented on return to shipping and to end market demand is relatively near-term. Beyond that, we continue to work with our customers and believe that we'll benefit as the volume levels return. So beyond just shipping to end market demand, we should see some growth and return to normalcy over the coming years. And then maybe beyond that, even into the longer term, we should see the benefits from the investments we're making, that would be sort of beyond 5G, and you're looking into the migration to DOCSIS 4.0 within HPA, the one-to-many phenomenon bought commented on in defense and aerospace will continue within CSG, there's the move to WiFi 7 and among many other things that we're investing in and expect to see growth there. In the near term, inventory to that piece of the question, we are seeing pockets, which we've talked about before in base station and partially in WiFi in some consumer areas, which will take longer for us to work through versus Android. And Dave, I don't know if you have anything further.\nDave Fullwood: Yes, nothing to hit it right, Grant. And the inventories in the channel for most of the components outside of Android, we'll probably be on a similar cadence, maybe into early next year other than base station. We don't have as good a visibility into our customers' end markets and how much inventory may be there that they need to work for. So that's probably a little bit of uncertainty for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Congrats on the great guidance. And sorry, if these were answered, but December, did you still expect that to be flat revenues, flattish from September, any other thoughts on seasonality moving forward? And then, Grant. I know you expect revenue to grow fiscal year-on-year. Any chance that EPS could grow as well or is that a little too far of a long shot?\nGrant Brown: Sure, thanks, Chris. And I'm glad you asked the question actually on December. So when we made the comments to a flattish December, it was on our -- previously anchored to our last quarter guidance. So I would expect that right now, given that we're not anticipating significant growth in fiscal '24 that I'd pouch that with the comments we made last quarter, it could end up being slightly down to flattish. And then, of course, some seasonal decline in March. Potentially less than normal as we clear the channel. So, that question hadn't been asked. I'm glad you went there. In terms of EPS, I have given majority of the P&L but haven't commented specifically on -- on annual EPS relative to fiscal '23.\nChristopher Rolland: And then I thought it was interesting you mentioned silicon carbide, I believe, it was for AI servers, if I got that right, and is that like DC to DC or into power supplies? Or any other detail there would be great, if I got that right.\nGrant Brown: Yeah, you got that right. It's for power supply in the servers, and of course, AI and any kind of applications like that is going to drive demand there. So that's good for us, but yes, that's a strong market for us as we grow our silicon carbide business.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.\nEdward Snyder: Thank you, guys. Thanks a lot. Based on everything you've said here, a bit stronger than expected guidance in September and everything you said about Android, you're not expecting a rebound, et cetera. That suggests that the extra strength is coming from the content gains at your largest customer, and doesn't that imply, given your share and all that, that you're going to see, well, year-over-year in content is going to have to be up much more significantly at 40% overall, have I got that math right?\nGrant Brown: Thanks, Ed. I think you are consistent with what we've been saying, we're going to have significant content gains at our largest customer. And as I've said in other public forums, that's primarily in products that we already participated in, where we've been able to grow our share as well as they are adding content.\nEdward Snyder: Right. So that was my second question because you have been clear the content gains are kind of a mix of both. Share gains and new content. Does that mean that we will see you in sections, the RFP that we haven't seen in the past when we talk about new content or is it just additions to areas you've been very strong in previously? And how sticky do you feel the share gains will be over the next year or so, especially the ones that you're taking from other folks, just curious?\nRobert Bruggeworth: Yeah, thanks, Ed. Again, what I've said publicly is, which I know it's hard for many of you to find, in the antenna tuner space, almost some of the other small components that are in there that, quite honestly, a lot of you missed, they are not on the motherboard, they are on various other flex circuits and things like that. Gaining there and in the ultra-high band we've talked. It's PA and BAW filter, we've been in for about three years. So that's the area. So it's really in those two areas primarily.\nEdward Snyder: Those areas that, you guys actually have been quite strong and they're expanding given all the new connectivity going on here makes sense. And we highlighted every antenna tuners. I think you're up like 12 to 15 in the last model, plus a couple of impedance tuners too. So that's generally what we're talking about in most of the gains?\nRobert Bruggeworth: Your numbers, not my number. I'm not going to comment on the units, number of units per phone. I will say you're in the right area. And I'd also point out, we publicly said the last couple of quarterly calls as well that we still believe there's lots of opportunity for us to grow with that customer. We look forward in the coming years.\nEdward Snyder: Great. Thank you, Bob.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to the management for closing comments.\nRobert Bruggeworth: Well, thank you, everyone for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with you at upcoming investor events. Thank you and hope you have a good night.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
