        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's conference call to discuss Algoma Steels fiscal third quarter 2024 Financial Results. My name is Paul, and I'm your operator for today's call.  At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mike Moraca Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for Algoma. Mr. Moraca, please go ahead.\nMike Moraca: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Algoma Steel Group Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Leading today's call are Michael Garcia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rajat Marwah, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and will be made available for replay later today in the Investors section of Algoma Steel's corporate website at www.algoma.com. I would like to remind you that, comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which involve assumptions and inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from statements made today. In addition, our financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differs from US GAAP, and our discussion today includes references to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Last evening, we posted an earnings presentation to accompany today's prepared remarks. The slides for today's call can be found in the Investors section of our corporate website. With that in mind, I would ask everyone on today's call to read the legal disclaimers on slide 2 of the accompanying earnings presentation, and to also refer to the risks and assumptions outlined in Algoma Steel's third quarter fiscal 2024 management's discussion and analysis. Please note that, our financial statements are prepared using the US dollar as our functional currency and the Canadian dollar as our presentation currency. Our fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31, and our financial statements have been prepared for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023. Please note all amounts referred to on today's call are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Following our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Garcia. Mike?\nMichael Garcia: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal third quarter results. As is customary, I'll start by highlighting our top priority, the safety of our employees. At Algoma, we uphold an unwavering commitment to safety, which has resulted in a notable improvement to lost time injury performance year-to-date. While our site remains bustling with activity, it's crucial to underscore the significance of safety particularly as our EAF project progresses with increase in contractor involvement. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of zero workplace injuries. Next, I'll cover key events and milestones during our fiscal third quarter and subsequent to events, as well as giving an update on progress at our transformative EAF project. I will then turn the call over to Rajat for a deeper dive into the numbers and a discussion of our strong liquidity and balance sheet, before closing with an update on market conditions. There are a few important things I would like to get across on this call. Our long-term strategy remains unchanged and on track to successfully execute the transition to being one of North America's greenest producers of steel. Our results for the quarter were comfortably in line with our expectations. Our facilities are back online with a goal of reaching full production as quickly and safely as possible, following the coke-making utility structure collapse. And finally, the outlook for our end markets calls for an improvement in pricing relative to calendar year 2023. Now, let me give you some additional color on those key themes. Our results for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 were in line with our previously disclosed guidance on both shipments and adjusted EBITDA, and we achieved year-over-year improvements in nearly all of our key metrics. As a reminder, our fiscal third quarter included major seasonal maintenance, which was completed as planned ahead of the winter months. Due to the lagging nature of our order book, realized pricing in the quarter did not yet reflect the run-up in markets around the end of the UAW strike. That stronger pricing is expected to begin benefiting our financial results in the fiscal fourth quarter, which unfortunately will be largely offset by impacts related to the outage caused by the incident at our coke-making plan that I will discuss in more detail shortly. Our fiscal third quarter is typically a busy one in terms of seasonal maintenance, and this year was no exception. In totality, the work was completed as planned. We also built seasonal inventories for our normal practice going into the end of the calendar year. During the quarter, we made additional progress on Phase II of our plate mill modernization project, including bringing the in-line share online and ramping up its production through the end of the year. We expect higher production levels of plate going forward, which will allow us to capture market opportunities and to build inventory ahead of the planned outages for the implementation of the final pieces of the modernization project. As a reminder, we have split the originally planned 40-day outage into two shorter duration outages with the first outage scheduled in April and the second outage planned for late calendar year 2024 to align with other planned maintenance activities providing some efficiencies on downtime. Next I'd like to update you on the progress during the quarter on our transformational electric or EAF project. The EAF will ultimately increase our throughput capacity by roughly a third from CAD2.8 million tons per year of liquid steel making capacity by conventional means today for CAD3.7 million tons employing dual furnaces upon completion. The higher output will match our expanded downstream finishing capacity as we increase capacity at our plate mill. We will improve overall product mix and lower our carbon emissions by approximately 70% when fully operational. When factoring in the makeup of our power supply when we switch to EAF operations we expect to be one of the greenest producers of steel in North America. During the quarter, cumulative investment in the EAF project reached CAD510 million. To-date, we have committed contracts totaling approximately CAD750 million with approximately 7% tied to time and material contracts, while the balance is fixed price in nature. We expect to contract the majority of the remaining project elements by the end of the current quarter. This will significantly derisk the EAF project budget as we progress towards our expected commissioning in late calendar year 2024. As a reminder, our start-up plan continues to include normal production from our existing steelmaking facility, while ramping up steel production from our EAFs in calendar year 2025, followed by a complete switch to EAF production. Before I hand it over to Rajat, let me give you an update on our operations currently. As we previously disclosed on January 20 and January 23, there was an incident at our coke making plant that involved the collapse of a structure supporting utilities plankton. Thankfully there were no injuries. But the event did impact several utilities that service the coke batteries and other facilities throughout the steelworks. Coke making operations were suspended at the time of the incident and we were able to stabilize heat to all three batteries and resume partial coke production within 72 hours of the incident. When factoring in coke inventories on hand, the availability of third-party coke and our partial production capabilities, we are able to satisfy all of our steel-making raw material input, while at the same time pursuing a permanent repair plan for the plant. As we also disclosed previously at the time of the incident, we temporarily suspended blast furnace operations for safety reasons. The blast furnace experienced operational challenges upon initial restart due to unforeseen impacts related to the piping collapse. All necessary repairs to the blast furnace have been completed and the furnaces gradually being brought back online. Usable hot metal is expected to be produced within the next seven days with the return to full production anticipated within the next two weeks. Most importantly, we will undertake these recovery efforts with the safety of our employees and our community at the forefront. While doing this we continue to advance the EAF project on schedule. I'd like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and professionalism. Now I will pass the call over to Rajat to go over our financial results for the quarter. Rajat?\nRajat Marwah: Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. As a reminder all numbers are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. We shipped 516,000 tons in the quarter up 12.6% as compared to the prior year period. Our plate and strip operations ran well in the quarter even as we completed a normal seasonal maintenance including our annual steelmaking vessel inline. Net sales realization averaged CAD1,079 per ton down 3.3% versus the prior year period. The decrease versus the prior year level primarily reflects somewhat softer market conditions in the quarter, in particular the residual lower prices resulting from the UAW strike and due to the lagging nature of our order book. Plate pricing continued to enjoy a significant premium relative to hot-rolled coil during the quarter, driven by resilient demand particularly from spending on infrastructure projects and durables goods. Steel revenue in the quarter totaled CAD 556.9 million, up 8.8% versus the same quarter of last year reflecting the increase in shipments that more than offset lower average realizations per ton of steel. On the cost side, although most cost per ton of steel products sold averaged 10.07 in the quarter, down 11.2% versus the prior year period. The decrease versus the prior year period is primarily attributable to favorable leverage on higher volumes. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of negative CAD 1 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of negative 0.2%, an improvement from negative CAD 35.9 million and negative 6.3% in the year ago period. Cash used in operations totaled CAD 47.4 million for the quarter compared to a use of CAD 128.6 million in the prior year period. Our inventories at the quarter end were CAD 886.6 million, up 7.8% during the quarter due to normal seasonal build patterns ahead of winter. We would typically expect to release inventories in the first half of calendar 2024, heavily weighted towards the first calendar quarter. But the impact of the Coke-Making plant incident will result in higher levels of inventory for inputs like ore and coal, delaying some of that anticipated inventory release. Looking prospectively, we do expect the fourth fiscal quarter to experienced directionally higher EBITDA versus the third fiscal quarter. Promised performance will obviously be impacted by the production outage related to the utility structure collapse. All told, we expect the incident to impact production and shipments for more than three weeks, totaling roughly 120,000 tons to 150,000 tons. It should be noted that Algoma carries standard insurance coverage that is intended to protect the company at times like this including business interruption insurance. We have begun the process of submitting claims under our policy for covered losses and insurance adjusters and advisers were on-site and so similarly, we are working closely with them to secure our protection. We expect to have more details on this front in coming months. From a working capital perspective, we had mentioned on our previous call that we expect to release a total of CAD 150 million by the end of fiscal 2025, with approximately CAD 100 million of working capital drawdown in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024. On account of the Coke-Making utility structure collapse and the related operational outages, we expect to release 70% less than originally expected amount in the fourth fiscal quarter. This timing issue will result in us releasing the balance over the subsequent quarters and we still expect to release approximately CAD 150 million over this period. I would like to provide a reiteration of our funding plans for the year projects. As previously noted, our outlook for total cost of the project remains in the range of CAD 825 million to CAD 875 million. Towards the end of the quarter, we had spent CAD 510 million or 60% of expected total, leaving CAD 340 million of investment demand. We are well positioned today and we look at our expected sources for those expenditures over the course of 2024. We have structured our balance sheet such that the only long-term debt we carry is in the form of government loans linked to our capital projects, allowing us to maintain a very low leverage profile, with ample liquidity of nearly CAD 400 million at quarter end to manage through market fluctuation and complete our capital initiatives. We have cash on hand of nearly CAD 95 million, another CAD 76 million of available capacity on our Federal CEF loan, and approximately CAD 150 million of cash to be generated from working down excess working capital in the months ahead. Combined, this roughly matches the expected capital requirements to complete the project, highlighting our ability to advance this transformative project as planned. I'd now like to turn the call back to our CEO, Michael Garcia for closing comments. Mike?\nMichael Garcia: Thank you, Rajat. Looking at the state of the North American steel market, hot-rolled coil index prices moved dramatically higher in October, as the settlement and the UAW strike became apparent and steel consumers rush to replenish their inventory needs. Over the calendar fourth quarter, pricing moved from the mid-$600 range to touch nearly $1,100 per net ton by the end of the year. Pricing so far in 2024 has come in with index prices dropping by approximately $50 and futures falling into the mid $800 per ton US average for the balance of 2024, while off from year-end highs these prices still represent a meaningful improvement from levels seen during much of 2023. As Rajat mentioned, we are also supported by the fact that plate pricing continues to demonstrate a significant premium as overall demand for plate products remains high and this in turn continues to benefit our average price realizations, especially as we ramp up operations in our plate mill. 2024 will be an important year in the story of Algoma as we continue to execute work towards the commissioning of our transformative EAF project. This will usher in the next phase of our Company that defines the future of Algoma provides the foundation for long-term value creation for our stakeholders and solidifies our leadership position at the forefront of green steel production in North America. Thank you very much for your continued interest in Algoma Steel. At this point, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator, please give the instructions for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Ocampo with Cormark Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Ocampo: Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just on a bigger picture question. I guess, when you look to 2025, you guys have always discussed being a hybrid operator and either tilting towards being a pure-play EAF or throwing in a little bit of your blast furnace there. When you think about the issues that just happened with the coke facility and even the blast furnace, does that change your tune on what you guys ultimately decide for 2025 or is it just going to come down to cost? I'm curious on your thoughts there.\nMichael Garcia: Hi, David. This is Mike. Yes, I think that right now our plan still remains to operate in 2025 in a hybrid mode. That's been the plan for some time as well as we think it makes the right financial sense as well and obviously, financially we'll continue to keep a very close eye on that. Given the incident in the past two weeks, we'll have to understand the state of the assets and make sure we're comfortable with the asset integrity of both blast furnace, which we pay a lot of attention to and it features very prominently on our asset integrity and asset reliability plan, but as well as the coke ovens. But assuming nothing significantly changes in either one of those perspectives or analysis, we feel comfortable with our current plan.\nDavid Ocampo: Got it. And it may be early days, and maybe this one's for Rajat, but how should we be thinking about the cost structure when you guys are hybrid operator is it no cost plus type model or just curious what the added costs will be with the dual cost structure, DuPont – dual manufacturing process?\nRajat Marwah: Hi, David. The best way to look at it is that we will be operating an additional facility, which is the electric arc facility. And as we indicated in the past, it probably will carry 100 to 140 people more from a mining perspective, which is -- which becomes your fixed cost then the rest most of it becomes variable in the form of using metal in the electric arc furnace or using metal through the blast furnace. So, as far as, you know the added fixed cost is concerned, it's that and the maintenance costs will not be much as it is a new asset. So we don't expect it to be substantially higher as we go through it. It definitely will be higher as we are transitioning and as the as we transition and start shutting down the facilities and start reducing the fixed costs on those facilities the costs will start coming down.\nDavid Ocampo: And last one for me Rajat. You gave some capital plans at least as it relates to the year I was hoping you could square up the total CapEx for this year broken down by maintenance, the plate modernization and then layering on the app on top of that?\nRajat Marwah: So then when you say this year, you're talking of 2025 fiscal?\nDavid Ocampo: I guess 2024 calendar.\nRajat Marwah: 2024 calendar. So, yeah, pretty much should be should be in line. So it should be a little roughly a CAD250-odd million on year that we'll be spending from a CapEx perspective. And this is gross CapEx, not net, and then we will be spending on our maintenance. It's roughly CAD100 million to CAD120 million on our maintenance CapEx. That could be we'll be spending, so that's your total. So there is some plate mill CapEx that will be spent in the first quarter, and little bit later on -- to complete the complete replacement projects. And that's how the CapEx will run. That is the money spent on recovery of the coke batteries, which definitely will form part of the whole analysis that we're doing along with insurance, but that will be in addition.\nDavid Ocampo: Got it. Thanks so much. I'll hand the call over.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. First just to confirm, you expect EBITDA to be higher sequentially in 4Q?\nRajat Marwah: That's correct.\nKatja Jancic: And that's mostly going to be driven by pricing? Or is there any cost puts and takes there?\nRajat Marwah: It’s mostly will be pricing, cost will be pretty similar and from variable cost perspective fixed cost depending on the volume definitely will be higher, but it's mostly coming from pricing.\nKatja Jancic: And this currently assumes three weeks of lost production right?\nRajat Marwah: Yeah, roughly 120,000 to 150,000 tons of production and shipment.\nKatja Jancic: And maybe just on the blast furnace, close to needing a full reline, is there a risk that that complicates the restart?\nMichael Garcia: Hi Katja. This is Mike. No not really. I think the up the blast furnace disruption, it was more related to the utility service incident at coke making, we've restarted it and are slowly bringing it back to good. I don't think the time since the last reline is really a factor into the incident that happened, or the state that we'll get it back to once we're making good metal. Does that help?\nKatja Jancic: Yes. Thank you. I'll hop back into the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Gillies with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. \nQ – Ian Gillies: Good morning, everyone.\nMichael Garcia: Good morning, Ian.\nQ – Ian Gillies: Just to reconfirm on the working capital numbers you provided, do you suggesting that for fiscal year 2024 it will be call it a CAD40 million to CAD50 million release. And then in fiscal year 2025, we're looking at another CAD100 million release?\nRajat Marwah: Yes.\nQ – Ian Gillies: And the follow on from that question is, does that contemplate and incurrence of or investing in additional working capital ahead of the EAF ramp? Because I presume, you're going to have to start buying some scrap ahead of startup and commissioning, at year end?\nRajat Marwah: Yes, it does. And just for context, we will be buying scrap, but not much as we are not much by end of this year, as we are ramping up, it probably will be more in the following year as we buy. And at that point in time, our iron ore and coal inventory will go down substantially, as well. So yes it does consider whatever we will buy, for the ramp-up and we'd still be reducing that CAD100 million or CAD150 million in total by next year.\nQ – Ian Gillies: And Rajat, given some of I guess the timing differences now, with spending day in relation to the EAF and the use of the credit facility. Is there anything within the government loans you have right now that prevents the incurrence of additional debt or anything like that could limit your availability?\nRajat Marwah: No, there are good or buckets or baskets, which are available that we can, if we have to tap the credit market we can.\nQ – Ian Gillies: Okay. And then I suppose, as we start looking into the remainder of this year and as we think about timing of the capital cost for the EAF, is that an update you'll provide with your typical guidance that you provide in the early part of April or will that be provided at a later date you think?\nMichael Garcia: We're not sure, what you mean by or by the capital costs in.\nQ – Ian Gillies: Well, sorry, just to be clear, you had suggested that you think, you'll have every all the projects secured and the capital cost secured by the end of this calendar quarter, and you typically provide guidance in and around EBITDA for a quarter, call it early the following months or early April. I was just wondering if, within that release, you think you provide an update on the EAF and costs, et cetera?\nRajat Marwah: Yes, sure. We will. You know as we, and we typically do, we will provide a hub where we are on the on the year on the capital cost side, the -- our expectation is the majority of our cost should be fixed by that time and we'll definitely provide an update by that time.\nQ – Ian Gillies: Okay. Thanks very much. I'll turn it back over.\nMichael Garcia: Thanks Ian.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is form Ahmad Shaath with Beacon Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nQ – Ahmad Shaath: Hey, guys. Just maybe a first follow-up. I guess what reference point, do you suggest we use in terms of shipments for Q4 relative to the 120k to 150k that you guys mentioned, just because there's a lot of variability year to date on the shipment volume?\nRajat Marwah: Yes, so, typically we are at around 550k as an average for each quarter. So, you can you can start from there.\nAhmad Shaath: Perfect. That's very helpful. In terms of pricing, I guess you guys said that you expect directionally some stronger prices for throughout calendar '24 compared to calendar '23. As that the driver behind that is just the current futures curve or what assumptions are you driving this comment?\nRajat Marwah: It's actually the future curves that we are that we are seeing, that's driving the pricing is. The other thing that's definitely driving our expectation for this year is the spending that's happening on the -- in the infrastructure and other areas of the consumption as such for the demand as such has been stable, so we don't expect big changes as such other than the sentimental changes that happened. And also, we are factoring in the cost -- the cost element which has kept the loans at a higher number and kept the average through the cycle pricing at a higher number as well. So, some of those factors are considered. But yes, the futures are also indicating where the pricing is going.\nAhmad Shaath: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Rajat. And last one, I'm not sure if you guys touched on it, but are you guys planning maybe as we get closer to the commissioning of EAF, just update us on the potential savings and OpEx structure. It's been a while since I think the last update we had is from the data from the roadshow was going public. Just wondering, if there is a chance we get an update around those numbers this year?\nMichael Garcia: Yes, Ahmad, this is Mike. We'll continue to do that, as we update information and get closer to the commissioning of the commencement of commissioning on the EAFs at the end of this year, both on where -- what are what our end state will be, as well as more information around what the short hybrid period we'll look like from that perspective.\nAhmad Shaath: That's really helpful. Thanks for answering my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much, operator. Good morning everyone. Apologies if I missed this, but I wondered if you could maybe provide some color in terms of dollars and cents in regards to the coke incident and wondered, what was the OpEx impact this year might be? And then also from a CapEx side, what will be any additional costs from the incident in the longer term, any kind of long-term cost to consider? Thank you very much.\nMichael Garcia: Sure. I'll start, Lucas. So we've completed the preparation of the repair plan using it out, both outside engineering and internal resources. So we expect the total repair costs to be in the $20 million to $30 million range and should be complete sometime in the April time period in terms of costs. Beyond that, our aim is to do a complete recovery back to full production of the coke batteries. Thankfully during the incident of none of the three batteries suffered any thermal integrity degradation, we were able to protect the thermal integrity of all of all three batteries. So once the repair is executed, our goal is to get back to pre-incident of coke production levels.\nLucas Pipes: Got it. At any longer term costs that might be associated with this?\nRajat Marwah: I think it's a it's too early to say, but we the way the way we have looked at it right now and the end the world that we are doing in batteries as such are okay, the walls are okay. So we don't expect much to -- much degradation there which is -- which is the key from long-term cost perspective. As far as the corridor is concerned the piping, that's the cost that we have assessed which is $20 million to $30 million. So at high-level I don't -- we don't think that there will be additional costs, but we'll know more as we restart the furnace to full production. And just some added color during that period, we'll probably be running at 30% to 40% of our production and using external coke during this quarter. So and come next quarter we should get down to our full production levels.\nLucas Pipes: Very helpful. Thank you. And I'll turn to a kind of high-level topic, on M&A. I saw a very active process in the US with US Steel. And kind of I'm wondering, how you look at the M&A landscape at this --at this time? Is there something that you think strategically could it -- could possibly benefit Algoma? Or how do you expect the landscape to kind of evolve, maybe more within Canada, would appreciate your thought. Thank you.\nMichael Garcia: Hi Lucas. While I'm sure will evolve, it's our policy not to -- not to speculate or comment on how we may be thinking around specific M&A opportunities. But I appreciate the question.\nLucas Pipes: Anything that would come strategically maybe be the uniquely beneficial to Algoma? Or is it really just focuses on the EAF from your side?\nMichael Garcia: Yeah. I mean, obviously, our short-term strategic path is clear. We believe that EAF brings a tremendous strategic value two to Algoma. We're laser focused on and executing that we're on-time, on-budget. And we very much look forward to commissioning at the end of this year, beginning commissioning.\nLucas Pipes: All right. Well I appreciate that. Thank you very much.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you, Lucas.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Mike Moraca, for any closing comments.\nMike Moraca: Well, thank you very much again for your participation in our third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call and your continued interest in Algoma Steel. We look forward to updating you our results and progress, when we report our fiscal fourth quarter results. It's scheduled for June. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I will now turn conference over to your host Mike Moraca, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer.\nMike Moraca: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Algoma Steel Group Inc's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Leading today's call are Michael Garcia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rajat Marwah, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be made available for replay later today in the Investors section of Algoma Steel's corporate website at www.algoma.com. I would like to remind you that comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which involve assumptions and inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from statements made today. In addition, our financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differs from U.S.GAAP and our discussion today includes references to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Last evening, we posted an earnings presentation to accompany today's prepared remarks. The slides for today's call can be found in the Investors section of our corporate website. With that in mind, I would ask everyone on today's call to read the legal disclaimers on Slide 2 of the accompanying earnings presentation and also refer to the risks and assumptions outlined in Algoma Steel's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Management's Discussion and Analysis. Please note that our financial statements are prepared using the U.S. dollar as our functional currency, and the Canadian dollar as our presentation currency. Our fiscal year runs from April 01 to March 31 and our financial statements have been prepared for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. Please note all amounts referred to on today's call are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Following our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Garcia.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal second results. As always, I will begin my remarks by addressing what truly matters most to us. The safety of all out employees. At Algoma we believe in safety without compromise and continued dedication has led to a significant improvement in our loss time injury frequency rate over the past decade. Furthermore, we bring the same focus and attention to safety as we continue progressing on the largest capital project in our history our EAF Transformation Project.I want to commend the team for working 420,000 hours with no loss time injuries to date and want to emphasize the importance of safety, especially as we enter the winter months. We will continue to work diligently as we relentlessly pursue our goal of achieving zero workplace injuries. Next, I'll cover key events and milestones during our fiscal second quarter and subsequent to its end. As well as update you on the progress of our transformative EAF project.I will then turn the call over to Rajat for a deeper dive into the numbers and the discussion of our strong liquidity and balance sheet before closing with an update on market conditions. Our results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 were in line with our previously disclosed guidance for both shipments and adjusted EBITDA.These results reflect solid operational performance against a challenging backdrop in steel markets, where the recently resolved UAW strike at various US auto making facilities impacted demand and pricing. During the quarter, we continued progress on phase II of our plate mill modernization project. Including commissioning and testing of the inline shear. We expect the shear to be online later this month and to wrap up plate production through the end of the year.This higher production level will allow us to capture market opportunities and to build inventory ahead planned outages for the implementation of the final phase of the modernization project. The project team has worked through the detailed implementation steps and identified opportunities to further de-risk this phase. Originally, we had planned on one outage standing 40 days.However, we have identified advantages to splitting the outages into two shorter duration outages of up to 20 days, which we expect will mitigate the impact on our customer base while also reducing commissioning risk. The first outage will be in April of next year and the second outage will be scheduled for later in the calendar year to align with our planned maintenance outages providing further advantages. We still expect increase in production volume over the course of the year with much less impact on our customers. Turning to other strategic initiatives.We have made significant progress on securing key raw material inputs during the quarter. We signed a two-year extension to our existing iron ore purchase contract with U.S. Steel with an option for a third year at our sole discretion.By extending the existing contract, we now anticipate our iron ore volumes needed to make the transition to electric arc furnace steel making are fully covered giving us certainty of supply and uninterrupted access. On the coking coal front, we have settled our calendar 2024 contract needs and pricing for this raw material is expected to be down low double digits in 2024.So given the certainty of labor, due to the 5 year union agreement signed last year, the contract for our iron ore needs for the next few years and our coking coal contracts for calendar 2024 we have solidified our inputs and created better visibility into our cost structure for the next several quarters, positioning us to expand margins especially as steel price has continued to improve from recent strike impacted weakness.We are optimistic as forward prices have hovered around $1000 U.S. per ton for hot rolled coil in recent days, reflective of the pent up demand and low inventory levels at certain customers. Next, I'd like to update you on our progress during the quarter on our transformational EAF project. This will still will ultimately increase our throughput capacity by roughly a third, from 2.8 million tons per year of liquid steelmaking capacity by conventional means today to 3.7 million tons, employing dual EAF furnaces upon completion.The higher output will match our expanded downstream finishing capacity as we increase throughput at our plate mill. Importantly, this will improve overall product mix while simultaneously lowering our carbon emissions by approximately 70% when fully operational.When factoring in the makeup of our power supply when we switch to EAF operations, we expect to be one of the greenest producers of steel in North America.During the quarter, cumulative investment in the EAF project reached $456 million or 54% of our expected total project cost at the midpoint of our project budget.We have made meaningful progress since quarter end securing uncontracted portions of expected project cost, and as of today, approximately 80% of the total project budget is under contract.We expect to contract the remainder that as of the project budget by the end of March 2024. Furthermore, it is important to point out that as of now, only 5% of the total contracted amount is subject to time and material adjustments, meaning the vast majority is under fixed price terms.This demonstrates significant de-risking of the EAF project over the past several months as we progress towards the startup commissioning in late calendar 2024.As a reminder, our startup plan continues to include normal production from our existing steel making facility, while ramping up steel production from our EAFs in calendar 2025. Followed by a complete switch to EAF production.I spoke earlier about our successful efforts to secure coal and iron ore inputs for our existing operations and when you think about the inputs for EAF steelmaking, one of the most important is power.As we mentioned previously, we already have the required power to run the electric arc furnaces at our current run rate of 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons of shipments without relying on the blast furnace, utilizing on-site power generation and the current grid.We can utilize hot metal from the blast furnace opportunistically which would provide further upside to our current capacity. In this quarter, we received a system impact assessment for the second phase of our project, which means when the local 230K Volt line installed, we can run either EAF unit without running our on-site power plant.Also subsequent to the quarter end, the Ontario government's announcement and issuance of an order in council to accelerate regional power infrastructure upgrades provides further assurance for our long-term power requirements for our EAF project. All-in-all a significant amount of progress has been made substantially de-risking the availability and cost of the power needed for new EAFs. It’s an exciting time in Sault Ste Marieas our existing facilities operate normally and work on the EAF accelerates. I would like to once again thank all of our employees whose execution continues to deliver solid operational and financial results safely while simultaneously driving the EAF project forward.Now I will pass the call over to Rajatto go over our financial results for the quarter and give more details on the expected funding of our capital expenditures.\nRajat Marwah: Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. Our second quarter results included adjusted EBITDA of CAD81 million which reflects an adjusted EBITA margin of 11.1%.Cash generated from operating activities was CAD57.2 million. We finished the quarter with CAD213 million of unrestricted cash and our $300 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn, representing total liquidity in excess of CAD500 million. We mentioned in our previous calls and included in our strategic direction, our focus on financial discipline.We have structured our balance sheet with the only long-term debt in the form of government loans linked to our capital projects and maintained a very low leverage profile with ample liquidity to manage through market fluctuations and complete our capital initiatives.I'll now dive into the key drivers of our performance in the quarter. We shipped 549,000 net tons in the quarter, up 26.1% as compared to the prior year period. Our plate and strip operations continued to run well and our normal seasonal maintenance is occurring as expected, including our annual steelmaking vessel realign. As a reminder, this normal seasonal maintenance typically reduces production by 20,000 tons to 30,000 tons.As a result, we would expect our fiscal third quarter production to be lower sequentially as compared to the fiscal second quarter.Net sales realizations averaged CAD12 to CAD13 per ton, down 4.3% versus the prior year period. The decrease versus the prior year levels primarily reflects overall softer market conditions in the quarter.Plate pricing continued to enjoy a significant premium relative to hot-rolled coil during the quarter, driven by resilient demand, particularly from spending on infrastructure projects and durable goods.As a reminder, we are the only discrete plate mill in Canada and we look forward to the incremental terms from the plate mill in the calendar fourth quarter and beyond as a result of the new shear installation.Steel revenue in the quarter totaled CAD665.8, up 20.7% versus the same quarter of last year reflecting the increase in shipments that were more than offset by lower average realization per ton of steel. On the cost side, Algoma's cost per ton of steel products sold average CAD10.21 in the quarter, down 1.6% versus the prior year period. The main drivers of the decrease versus the prior year period include the positive impact of increased volumes versus the prior quarter, our cost of steel products sold were approximately 7% higher, attributed to lower volumes, higher costs related to various raw materials and utility inputs, including natural gas and purchased coke.Cash flow from operations totaled CAD57.2 million for the quarter compared to a use of CAD66.1 million in the prior year period.Our inventories at the quarter end were CAD822.7, up 8.3% during the quarter due to normal seasonal bed patterns. We expect to build inventories further during the calendar fourth quarter ahead of winter as we typically do at this point in the year and to release inventories in the first half of calendar 2024, heavily weighted towards the first calendar quarter. Now I'd like to provide additional color on our funding plans for the EF project.As previously noted, our outlook for the total cost of the project remains in the range of CAD825 million to CAD875 million. To the end of the quarter, we had spent CAD456 million or 54% of the expected total cost.Leaving CAD394 million to be spent. We're well positioned today when we look at our expected sources for those expenditures.We have cash on hand of over CAD200 million, another CAD93 million of available capacity on our Federal CEF loan, and approximately CAD150 million of cash to be generated from drawing down excess working capital with approximately 70% of this coming in the fourth fiscal quarter and the balance coming in the following fiscal year.Combined, this exceeds the remaining expected capital requirement to complete the project. With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Garcia for closing comments.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you, Rajat. Looking at the state of the North American steel markethot-rolled coil index prices fell approximately 25% in the calendar third quarter as the concerns about and the reality of a UAW strike weighed on the market.Capacity was curtailed at several North American mills as a result, and inventories across distributors were drawn down.We do expect this to meaningfully impact EBITDA in the current fiscal quarter, as lower prices and lower shipments on account of our planned maintenance outages are felt. Looking further out as labor settlements have been reached over the last few days pricing has rapidly moved higher and we have seen forward curve pricing climb to near CAD1000 per ton, which will provide significant upside in the fourth fiscal quarter.We are also supported by the fact that plate pricing continues to demonstrate a significant premium as overall demand per plate products remains high which in turn continues to benefit our average price realizations. We will relentlessly maintain our primary focus of operational excellence and maintaining prudent financial discipline regardless of volatility in our end markets.This will ensure our ability to execute our EAF project, ushering in the next phase of our company that defines the future of Algoma, provides for the long term value creation of our stake holders and solidifies our leadership position at the forefront of green steel production in North America. Thank you very much for your continued interest in Algoma Steel. At this point we would be happy to take your questions. Operator, please give the instructions for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you and at this time we will be conduction question and answer session. [Operator Instructions].Our first question comes from the line of David Ocampo with Cormark Securities.\nDavid Ocampo: Thanks. I guess my first one here is for Rajat.Based on kind of your annual buys that you have for your raw materials and your new iron ore contract, do you guys think we've hit peak raw material prices and how should that trend into next year?\nRajat Marwah: Yes. So for coal, definitely it comes down and I don't know you see how the index fluctuates, so that affects to some extent as we have two contracts right now running,but I would say that you are you're right that we should see cost coming down in the future.Normally, the winter months have some challenges primarily based on a high cost of utilities, natural gas and power that goes through, but other raw materials should start coming down as we go into the next year.\nDavid Ocampo: Okay and then I guess just sticking with you, Rajat, I mean, if I take a look at your inventory levels, they're still a little bit elevated.They actually saw an uptick in the quarter. Can you just walk us through how those raw materials or finished product begins to unwind and how much cash we can expect to unlock in the next several quarters?\nRajat Marwah: Sure. So, we normally build during December and this is typical, and then we'll release in March, and then we'll do the same next year, but when you look at March to March, or March end to March end, we should release, you know, around CAD100 million in working capital and I say working capital, it includes inventories and some other on the payable side as they go hand in hand.So you'll see that happening and then there is another CAD50 million odd that we should see in the following year.So we should see that CAD150 million coming down. It's taking a little longer as I had mentioned earlier as well that we have inventories which will take a little bit longer to run down and this is primarily on the - on the raw material side. On the finished goods and [Indiscernible], as cost comes down, we should see that improving, but from tonnage perspective, we should see some optimization happening.\nDavid Ocampo: Got it and then my last one, it could be for whoever wants to take it, but you typically set your annual contracts around this time at least that 10% that you typically hold out on. Was this done before the resolution of the UAW strike or post the strike when we saw much better pricing conditions?\nMichael Garcia: David, this is Mike. I think it's happened throughout. It's still happening now. So it really depends on the specific customer and kind of the historical timeframe, but we definitely began it, on the cusp of the strike, but it's continuing to happen as we're speaking.\nDavid Ocampo: Okay perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.\nKatja Jancic: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First, maybe on the plate side, I think you mentioned that the demand environment remains healthy and prices elevated, but what we're seeing in the U.S. that one of your peers has actually announced that they are reducing prices, and it seems that the demand environment is softening.Can you talk a bit more? Are you seeing a different environment in Canada and how much are you selling into the U.S. Market?\nMichael Garcia: Thanks, Katja. This is Mike. So when you think of our plate book of business, the majority of it is in Canada. It's roughly a 70/30 split between Canada and the U.S. and again, I think as reflected in the spread, which still remains large and actually opened up a bit this week we are still seeing pretty robust demand for our plate business.I think there are some segments of the plate market that are maybe under a little bit more pressure than others. I'm sure you saw the cancellation of the wind tower projects, but that's not a segment that we're in.So we still feel relatively confident about the plate spread and where our book of business is.Does that help?\nKatja Jancic: Yeah that's super helpful.Thank you for that and then just on near term costs side, given that the production level is going to be lower this quarter, how should we think about cost per ton, should they be higher or what are some of the puts and takes there?\nRajat Marwah: So it will be higher, just because of the volume.So the so the so when you look at puts and takes for the coming quarters, let's say or the coming quarter, at least, is that the volume definitely will impact, other costs are more or less very similar, utilities might continue, which is natural gas and power with some pressure on higher pricing.So that's how the next quarter will play out. Quarter after getting back to normal production levels, because the outages are out and then you still have the utility pressure and then you get into get into the summer months where you start getting into much normal situations.So that's how we see the costs playing out over the next couple of quarters.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gillies with Stifel.\nIan Gillies: Hi, everyone. With respect to the plate mill modernization and new shear being installed. If I recall correctly, I think that was supposed to be done at some point during this past quarter.It sounds like it's still ongoing. Has there been some sort of delay there impacted volumes or am I misreading the situation?\nMichael Garcia: No, I think what we had mentioned before was hot commissioning was beginning in this quarter. And we're pretty much right on schedule with that project.It is a pretty involved hot commissioning exercise and so we're still on track as we bring up that shear into more normal production in November and then consequently in December and through the first quarter of next year.\nIan Gillies: Okay. That's helpful and as you think about once you get past the two brief outages next year,do you have a good sense of where you think volumes are going to be post that?Or is that number still a bit influx depending on what might happen and if you do have a good idea, would you be willing to quantify it for us?\nMichael Garcia: Well, I think what we're aiming for, prior to the firstoutage in April is to roll in a 10% to 15% increase in our plate business and then building from there.The plate business, it's a very important market segment for us. We are spending a lot of time with customers now about and it's really kind of two pieces.It's recovering our position at some of our historical plate customers. We had some challenging times last year with the commissioning and the startup from phase 1 of the projects.So we had a little bit of room to recover, so to speak, but we've made the type of improvements in quality and promised performance that we believe the customers require of us and now as we bring on more capacity steadily through next year, we'll build our business with the quality and promised performance improvements as well as the increased flow path to handle it.\nIan Gillies: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks Mike. If I could just squeeze in one more. With respect to what you're seeing from your customers right now and as it pertains to the rise in HRC prices.How much of it do you think of this run is due to structurally stronger demand? And how much do you think is tied to inventories being rebuilt because I know buying had been pretty weak.I know it's a tough question to answer, but any commentary there I think would be helpful.\nMichael Garcia: Yes, it is a tough question to ask. Definitely, there is, an aspect of it and probably a significant aspect in the early days the first few weeks, couple of months that is tied more to a recovery from the positions people reach during the strike. Inventories were, I think, at two months, which is quite low.Lead times for the mills were out at eight weeks for the most part. So I think the initial stages of it have been a recovery from the concern and the specific outages tied to the UAW strike.I think going forward is where it'll really kind of demonstrate whether the rest of it, any further pricing beyond where we're reaching now will, I think, be more tied to fundamental demand and economic activity.\nIan Gillies: Understood. Thanks very much. That’s helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. RileySecurities.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much for taking my question.The first one is circling back on annual contracts and with the decline in raw material costs in 2024, would you expect the margin on annual contracts to increase or stay the same go down would appreciate your perspective on that?\nRajat Marwah: Sure. So, the contracts that we do are mostly index based and there is a very small amount that's on fixed price where you see that that happening, but overall, we should see margins improving because costs should get optimized and if the pricing remains at the level it is or lower, we should see higher margins. So relatively margins will be better because the cost comes down, but most of our contracts are index based, so it's heavily based on the on how the pricing moves throughout the year.\nLucas Pipes: Got it and thank you for that and can you remind us roughly what percentage would be fixed versus loading?\nRajat Marwah: We normally do around 5% or so fixed of our total bookand we normally do contracts around 50% to 60%. So 5% is fixed and the balances all flow based on monthly and quarterly contracts.\nLucas Pipes: Very helpful. Thank you for that and then my second question is on your coke procurement during the transition phase. Can you remind us what the strategy varies, what would you expect the mix to look like? And any possible savings on the on the capital side, as you as you transition. Thank you very much for your color.\nMichael Garcia: Yes, Lucas. So we continue to maximize production from ourinternal coke batteries and we continue to spend critically required capital to maintain those batteries in a safe operating condition,but the fact remains, even when they're running very well, we are still short of coke.So we'll continue to purchase coke externally as we've done in the past. We always try to minimize that number, but we expect that go forward into the future and we've gotten a little bit of a benefit here recently because the market price of coke has come down pretty significantly, but our approach remains the same.We will have to maintain the batteries, even though they don't have a long life or a life for us beyond our final transition to EAF production, but we're still spending some amount of required sustaining capital to keep them safe and operating profit properly.Does that help?\nLucas Pipes: It does.I do have a follow-up question. There's talk of some potential idling of blast furnace in 2024. So I would think that overall there's more coke available from a merchant basis.Is that tempting or when you kind of think about, if you just answered the question before that if you want to kind of maximize your internal needs, but is there a point where that can switch and where it makes more sense to buy more coke on a merchant base?\nMichael Garcia: Yes, I think at the end of the day, it comes down to economics.So we have to have a good understanding of our internal coke production cost, including the yield loss that you'll get in coke when you buy it externally and transport it here, but certainly if the economics change significantly in that decision internal production versus external purchase that's something we'll be tracking and be aware of and prepared to act on it.\nLucas Pipes: And how quickly could a switch occurs that decision you have to kind of make once a year, or can you be flexible as the year progresses and supply demand changes?\nRajat Marwah: Yeah. No, we can we can be pretty quick in that.It's not within days, but probably within months, we can we can switch. We don't have to wait for a year. Because what we do is that we do contract out based on our optimum production internally and if we have to switch that based on opportunity available in the market to buy at a price which offsets our own production then you have then we have that flexibility and we can move quickly within months.\nLucas Pipes: Very helpful. Really appreciate all the color and continue best of luck. Thank you.\nRajat Marwah: Thanks Lucas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ahmad Shaath with Beacon Securities.\nAhmad Shaath: Hi, guys.Just a really quick one for me on the EAF project. Did I read that right? The hybrid scenario is not on play anymore and you guys going to start commission on both EAFs, what your thoughts on the on the grid connectivity?\nMichael Garcia: No, I think hybrid is definitely still in play, but what we mentioned was that we wanted to emphasize that we will be able to match our current output with only running EAFs coal charge and the power that is available today and with the recent decisions by [Indiscernible] and the completion of the system impact study.So there's been a full kind of understanding of the impact of our power demand and the nature of it by the operator of the grid in Ontario. And they've issued some conclusions based on that.However, we still have the optionality to continue to run our blast furnaces and take advantage of hot metal from those blast furnaces at a reduced blast furnace rate to augment our production through the EAFs if we want to increase the total amount of steel produced and again, that'll go back to the economics and how that decision looks from an economic perspective.\nAhmad Shaath: Got it. That's very helpful. And, maybe alittle bit related on that. On the carbon tax credits, I saw the, at least from an income statement perspective, the number was a little bit higher, but it doesn't look like it had a big impact on your cash flow.So maybe that's one for Rajat, just to walk us through as we go forward. How should we think about that? All the blast furnace is continuing to operate.\nRajat Marwah: Sorry, Ahmed, can you repeat the question?\nAhmad Shaath: Yeah. I'm just trying to understand the potential impact on your cash flow from the carbon tax payment, because it was substantial in this quarter, somewhat or CAD12 million.I haven't seen that number in a while. Maybe help us explain why they're a little bit bigger, but from a cash flow perspective, it doesn't look like it, in fact, operating cash flow.So just trying to understand how it will impact your numbers.\nRajat Marwah: Got it. I thought government tax.So yes, carbon tax, so the way to look at carbon tax is, roughly pay on 5% of our emissions, which is roughly 200,000 tons and the price for this year is CAD50 million and for next year is goes up by another CAD15 million.So that's how the total cash out comes out and normally if the cash out goes in November. From accounting perspective, it was based on the estimates that come out until the time they are finalized those estimates are looked at and the accounting happens and that's how you see a big number coming in this quarter, which is the September quarter, but from cash out perspective and total expense perspective, it still remains a simple math of roughly 200,000 tons on an average and the price that gets published each year on what we need to pay it on.\nAhmad Shaath: Thank you that is very helpful and last one for me, if I heard you correctly, you do expect margins to improve, but because of the volume situation in fiscal Q3, we should expect a small dip and then calendar 2024 margins should start improving?\nRajat Marwah: Correct.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question and answer session.I'll now turn the call back over to CEO, Michael Garcia, for closing remarks.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you again for your participation in our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call and for your continued interest in Algoma Steel.We look forward to updating you on our results and progress when we report our fiscal third quarter results scheduled for February.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]."

My name is Doug and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, I'd like to hand the call over to Mike Moraca, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for Algoma. Mr. Moraca, please go ahead.\nMike Moraca: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Algoma Steel Group Inc's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Leading today's call are Michael Garcia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rajat Marwah, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be made available for replay later today in the Investors section of Algoma Steel's corporate website at www.algoma.com. I would like to remind you that comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which involve assumptions and inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from statements made today. In addition, our financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differs from U.S.GAAP and our discussion today includes references to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Last evening, we posted an earnings presentation to accompany today's prepared remarks. The slides for today's call can be found in the Investors section of our corporate website. With that in mind, I would ask everyone on today's call to read the legal disclaimers on Slide 2 of the accompanying earnings presentation and also refer to the risks and assumptions outlined in Algoma Steel's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Management's Discussion and Analysis. Please note that our financial statements are prepared using the U.S. dollar as our functional currency, and the Canadian dollar as our presentation currency. Our fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31 and our financial statements have been prepared for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Please note all amounts referred to on today's call are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Following our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Garcia.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal first quarter results. As always, I will begin my remarks by addressing what truly matters most to us. The safety and well-being of everyone at Algoma Steel. During our last quarterly call, we updated you on the tragic fatality of a contract worker at Algoma Steel on June 15, the Ministry of Labor was notified and attended the site to conduct its investigation, which remains ongoing. At Algoma, we believe in safety without compromise, and while our continued dedication has led to a significant improvement in our lost-time injury frequency rate over the past decade, we remain committed to creating a safe zero-injury workplace. Next, I'll cover the key events and milestones during our fiscal first quarter, and subsequent to its end, as well as an update on the progress at our EAF project. I will then turn the call over to Rajat for a deeper dive into the numbers and a discussion of our strong liquidity and balance sheet, before closing with an update on market conditions. Our results for fiscal first quarter of 2024 came in modestly ahead of our previously disclosed guidance for both shipments and adjusted EBITDA. Our shipments of 569,000 tons were up 5.9%, versus the prior year period. Our results reflect a quarter of solid operational execution, even in the face of commodity price volatility and we expect that momentum to continue throughout the fiscal year as we work in parallel to advance the investment and activity at our EAF project. On our last call, we provided an update on the progress of Phase 2 of our plate mill modernization project, including the in-line shear installation, which is progressing ahead of schedule. I am pleased to report that the shear installation is now complete and we expect to begin cold commissioning this month with hot trials expected by the end of this quarter. We plan for higher plate production levels after commissioning. We are very excited about this given the continued robustness of our current plate market and the high price spread over hot-rolled coil. This higher production level will allow us to capitalize on this market opportunity and to build inventory, ahead of the planned Phase 2 hot mill outage to upgrade the hot mill drives, currently scheduled for April of 2024. Next, I'd like to update you on our progress during the quarter on our transformational EAF project. This will ultimately increase our throughput capacity by roughly one-third, from 2.8 million tons per year of liquid steel-making capacity today via the blast furnace route to 3.7 million tons, employing dual electric arc furnaces upon completion. The higher liquid steel output is expected to match our expanded downstream finishing capacity, as we increase production at our plate mill. Importantly, this will improve overall product mix, while simultaneously lowering our carbon emissions by approximately 70% when fully operational. During the quarter, EAF expenditures totaled CAD74 million bringing cumulative spend as of June 30 to CAD341 million or 40% of our expected total project cost at the midpoint of our unchanged project budget. The construction of the main steelmaking building is progressing on schedule and we expect to begin receiving key equipment from Danieli this quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress securing the remaining portion of expected project cost, as bid packages continue to come in. Our expectations to begin commissioning in late calendar 2024 are also unchanged. Our start-up plan continues to include normal production from our existing steel-making facility, while ramping up steel production from our EAF in calendar 2025, followed by a complete switch to EAF production. We said on the last call, and I would like to reiterate today, that we expect the completion of the EAF project will be funded through a number of existing capital resources, including cash on hand, cash generated through operations, a drawdown of excess working capital, and the capital resources already available to us, such as the Federal, SIF loans. Rajat will get into more details there, but given our strong balance sheet that includes no debt outside of government loans and with full availability under our ABL credit facility, our operations are well supported throughout this exciting transition. Through the quarter, we demonstrated consistent and reliable operations. There is also no shortage of excitement here on site in Sault Ste Marie, as we see the EAF progressing rapidly and the future of our company becoming a reality. I'd like to once again thank all of our employees, whose execution continues to deliver solid operational and financial results, safely while simultaneously driving the EAF project forward. Now, I will pass the call over to Rajat to go over our financial results for the quarter and give more details on the expected funding of our capital expenditures.\nRajat Marwah: Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. I'll remind you again that all numbers are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. As Mike said, we had a solid quarter to start the fiscal year. Our first quarter results included adjusted EBITDA of CAD191.2 million or CAD336 per ton, which reflected an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1%. Cash generated from operating activity was CAD163.9 million, we finished the quarter with CAD300.6 million of unrestricted cash and our USD300 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn, representing total liquidity in excess of CAD600 million. As a reminder, the only remaining long-term debt on our balance sheet is in the form of government loans linked to our capital projects and those loans have highly attractive terms that include the potential for partial forgiveness of principal, as we reach certain carbon emission reduction targets with the shift to EAF steel-making in the coming years. I will now dive into the key drivers of our performance in the quarter. We shipped 569,000 tons in the quarter, up 5.9% as compared to the prior year period. Our plate and strip production continues to run well, and despite normal seasonal maintenance in the second half of the year, including our annual vessel reline, we expect our shipment in each of the next two quarters to be roughly in-line with our typical run rate achieved over the last several quarters. Net sales realization averaged CAD1,323 per ton, down 18.9% versus the prior year period. The decrease versus the prior-year level, primarily reflects overall softer market conditions. Plate ricing continued to enjoy a significant premium relative to hot-rolled coil during the quarter, driven by resilient demand particularly from spending on infrastructure projects and durable goods. As a reminder, we are the only discrete plate mill in Canada and we look forward to the incremental, additional tons from the plate mill in the second half of calendar 2023, as a result of the new shear installation Mike talked about. Steel revenue in the quarter totaled CAD754.5 million, down 14% versus the same quarter of last year, reflecting the lower average realizations per ton of steel that more than offset the increase in shipments. On the cost side Algoma's cost per ton of steel products sold, averaged CAD950 in the quarter, up 3.3% versus the prior year period. The main drivers of the modest increase versus the prior year period include the cost of replacing internally produced coke with purchased coke, and higher cost of other key inputs, which more than offset the positive impact of the increase in volumes. Cash flow from operations totaled CAD163.9 million for the quarter compared to CAD276.6 million in the prior year period, but up by CAD68.5 million sequentially. Our inventories at quarter end were CAD759.3 million, up only 5.1% during the quarter, which would otherwise have been a large increase due to normal seasonal build patterns of what is typically our lowest level in March. We expect to continue releasing inventories throughout the year, as quantities normalize with consistent production. Now, I would like to provide additional color on our funding plans for the EAF project. As previously noted, our outlook for total cost of the project remains in a range of CAD825 million to CAD875 million. Through the end of the quarter, we had spent CAD341 million, leaving approximately CAD510 million of investments, remaining to reach the mid-point of our project budget. We are well positioned today when you look at our expected resources for those expenditure over the next 12 to 18 months. We have cash on hand of roughly CAD300 million and another CAD135 million of available capacity on our SIF loan and approximately CAD150 million of cash to be generated from drawing down excess working capital. Combined, this exceeds the expected capital requirement to complete the project and does not include any borrowings on our ABL or any contribution from operating cash flow. Highlighting the strong position we are in as we advance this transformative project. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Garcia for closing comments.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you, Rajat. Looking at the state of the North American steel market, pricing levels in the fiscal first quarter saw periods of volatility with index pricing for U.S. Midwest hot-rolled coil ranging from approximately CAD850 to CAD1,200 per ton. Subsequent to the quarter end prices have continued to decline to current levels in the low CAD800s. Plate pricing continues to demonstrate a significant premium as overall demand for plate products remains high, which in turn continues to benefit our average price realizations. While the steel business involves inherent volatility, we address that volatility by serving a diverse customer base that provides selling opportunities across Canada and the US. We traditionally service roughly 150 customers in a calendar year and target a high percentage of contract sales. Those contracted volume commitments continued to provide stability to our order book and operations. And the lagging price mechanics help to smooth some of the volatility experienced when prices shift up or down quickly. While the forward curve show some expectation of stability at prices modestly lower than current spot, we've seen time again how quickly things can change. Regardless of the swings in our end markets, we will relentlessly maintain our primary focus of delivering prudent financial discipline and operational excellence. This will ensure our ability to execute our EAF project, ushering in the next phase of our company that defines the future of Algoma, provides the foundation for long-term value creation for our stakeholders and solidifies our leadership position at the forefront of green steel production in North America. Thank you very much for your continued interest in Algoma Steel. We are off to a solid start of our fiscal year and look forward to the rest of what promises to be a transformational year. At this point, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator, please give the instructions for the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just as a clarification, did you say that the volumes or shipments are expected to be similar in the next few quarters to the first quarter?\nRajat Marwah: Yes, so it's - it'll be similar, not exactly to the first quarter, but if you look at the last several quarters, it'll be an average of that, so similar but not same.\nKatja Jancic: And what about with plate expected to increase, is that still the expectation to raise volumes?\nMichael Garcia: Yes, Katja this is Mike. So shear is in and where we are currently conducting cold commissioning followed by hot commissioning. So by the end of this calendar year, we should start to see a 10% to 15% increase in plate volume. Now, that assuming we've done the work on the commercial side and we have the orders, and so some of that will be reflected in plate shipments, some of it will be used to build inventory ahead of the outage next April. But the total increase will be in the 10% to 15% by this November-December timeframe.\nKatja Jancic: Is this a bit of delay, I thought that was expected by third quarter calendar year?\nMichael Garcia: No, I think it's consistent with what we spoke about in our last call. Rajat?\nRajat Marwah: Yes, it was third fiscal quarter what we mentioned.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. And then maybe just on the cost side, how should we think about cost in the next few quarters?\nRajat Marwah: So cost will be pretty similar to what we are seeing right now. There should be some reductions coming as we keep increasing our production on the coke batteries, our internal coke and start replacing it with purchased coke, but that probably will come towards the end of the fiscal year. But for the next, let's say, one or two quarters our cost should be pretty similar.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you so much.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Ocampo with Cormark Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Ocampo: Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the last line of questions regarding costs. I think - I seem to remember that a portion of it is tied to HRC prices or some sort of index type of steel, as well as the IODEX for iron ore. I just would have thought that would - with steel prices coming down at least in the next quarter or maybe next two quarters, but your input costs would also follow that. So, maybe you could help reframe how we should be thinking about cost in the following steel price environment?\nRajat Marwah: Sure. So you're right, there is a portion of our contract that is linked to pricing and it has certain bands. So within a price range it moves and then it stops. So - and the other portion is based on IODEX. So with this - with the price drop in IODEX, remaining same or increasing it, it more or less offsets each other for the quarter or for the coming period. So that's how iron ore will play. Scrap definitely will help because scrap is coming down, and we expect other commodities - commodity price, if they come down, if price remains at lower level in the following quarters, we should see some reduction coming, some slight reduction coming. But it totally depends on how the commodities plays out in the next couple of quarters. But it should change slightly, but that's why I said it's very similar. Our cost quarter-over-quarter and for the next one or two quarters and then we will see some reductions coming just because of coke, as well as coal negotiations that will happen and it will start impacting in the next year. Does that give you some color.\nDavid Ocampo: Yes. That's helpful there. And I guess if I think about your breakeven cost structure, just given that framework that you laid out there, are you guys now closer to CAD700 a ton of breakeven on sheet prices?\nRajat Marwah: Yes, it should be in that - you're closer to that vicinity, may be slightly lower, but that's where it is - as we see the cost now.\nDavid Ocampo: Got it. Okay. And then a last one from me. One of your competitors here in Canada called out some customers deferring shipments just given the uncertainty that they're seeing in the marketplace, whether that's related to auto or not, you guys do have 130% exposure automotive. So are you guys, starting to see more of that from your customers or are there may be some pushback on taking delivery?\nMichael Garcia: Hi David. Not really, we don't have any large customer sector, where we're experiencing that.\nDavid Ocampo: Okay, that's it from me. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ahmad Shaath with Beacon Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAhmad Shaath: Hi, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe back on the cost structure. So is it fair to say that we should expect maybe some downward pressure on unit margins per ton, but not a lot, given the comments that I've heard from both the cost and the pricing side?\nRajat Marwah: Yes. There will be downward pressure, specifically from the pricing side. As you've seen that the price has from peak to low by CAD400 and the market is at CAD800, but frankly it's - CRU is at CAD800, but the market is lower. So there is definitely pressure from margins coming from the pricing side, which will impact the quarter. Now, our plate book is good and the plate pricing is good, which offset it as well as, as well as the contract position that we have helps us to maintain a decent margin for this quarter. And then it's - from forward perspective, it depends on how the pricing - how the pricing shapes up.\nAhmad Shaath: Got it, that's very helpful. Maybe back on your commentary on the volume side. If I look at the last several quarters, the range is pretty wide. It is pretty wide, I mean we're looking at from 430 to 570 tons. If you look at the last several quarters, so are you - will you be able to give us maybe a little more color on expected volume, is it just the last two quarters? Because if I go back to Q2, Q1 last fiscal year, the volumes were - obviously it was operational issues with the volume was down?\nRajat Marwah: Yes, Ahmad. I think it's a good point. Just take the outliers quarters, there were couple of quarters, which were - which are outliers. So take them out and then you average out, you should come to a good number.\nAhmad Shaath: Fair enough. That's great color. I appreciate it guys, will jump back in the queue.\nRajat Marwah: Okay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is, Rajat, I think you made some important comments regarding cash flow in the second half of the year in your prepared remarks, and I just wanted to make sure I fully understood those. So if you could maybe go back and just highlight your cash flow expectations for the second half of the year? I would really appreciate it. Thank you.\nRajat Marwah: Sure. So I did not specifically provide any guidance on the cash flow for the second half, but what I did say was that based on the cash that we have and I was talking about electric arc furnace funding, so based on the cash that we have on hand, the SIF loan that is yet to be received in cash of CAD135 million and also the important factor, which is a drawdown of our inventories, that is roughly CAD150 million of drawdown that we are expecting over the next several quarters, that will be enough to manage the spending - the remaining spending on the EAF project without even considering the operational cash flow that we will generate during that period. So that's what I commented on, which gives us enough liquidity to manage the EAF project.\nLucas Pipes: That is very helpful and congratulations on that.\nRajat Marwah: Thanks, Lucas.\nLucas Pipes: My second question is regarding coal procurement and it's a two-pronged question. The first is, how do you think about coal procurement in light of new EAF transition over the next few years? And then secondly, some of your North American peers have noted expectations for significantly lower coal prices in 2024, so I wondered if you could comment on that? Thank you very much.\nRajat Marwah: Sure. So I'll start with the second question. So the expectation is the same that the coal pricing should drop for next year. When you look at what's happening in the market we've seen a drop of 10% to 20% year-over-year from index perspective and we are expecting that the coal price should come down. Our negotiations will start soon and then we'll finalize for the following year. As far as the buy is concerned and the period of the buy, we've laid out a transition plan where we do the commissioning end of next year and then have a ramp up over a 12-month period, during which we will continue making steels for both the routes and then we - based on the availability of power and stability of our furnaces and availability of prime scrap, we will be running our blast furnace, which means coke battery as well for a little longer while we are transitioning through and then ramping it down. So we will be running our batteries and the blast furnace for next couple of years and the coal contracts are normally annual. So we will be renewing them carefully as we go along, but our first intention is that we want to exclude the purchased coke that we do right now and be self-sufficient on our coke production during the interim period and then start ramping it down.\nLucas Pipes: That's very helpful. I really appreciate the color. I'll try to squeeze one last one in. On the end markets can you maybe run down where you're seeing strength - persistent strength, where you're seeing more pockets of weakness, would really appreciate your perspective on the demand side? Thank you very much.\nMichael Garcia: Sure. I think before I go into any specific markets, on demand, we're roughly four weeks out in our order book on sheet a little longer five to six weeks in plate. Year-to-date the auto build rates have - been tracking as expected and our positive. Obviously, there is a lot of potential uncertainty with the OEM contract negotiations that are taking place and a September 14 expiration date of the current contract, it's probably a little bit too involved to try to predict the all of the knock-on effects on our order book from a potential labor disruption, but obviously a lot of steel is going into automotive. So if you have an industry slowdown, that's going to have some effects. On the distribution side of our business, we see the majority of our customers continue to buy, mostly when they have back-to-back needs of sales. So they're looking and they continue to manage their inventories closely, they've been doing that and that's the behavior we've seen for a while now. The coil market, although we continue to fill our coil order book, you can probably tell from the way that coil pricing has moved over the last several weeks that we still see a little slowness there, although our order book is still full, but that's mostly driven by distribution. Our markets around infrastructure build, where we send a lot of plate continue to be pretty, pretty firm and we see that in our plate demand and in our plate order book and obviously in the plate pricing. So that's kind of the some of the landscape that we're seeing on the commercial side, Lucas.\nLucas Pipes: Michael, really appreciate the color. To you and the team, continued best of luck.\nMichael Garcia: Thank you.\nRajat Marwah: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nMike Moraca: Thank you again for your participation in our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call and your continued interest in Algoma Steel. We certainly look forward to updating you on our results and progress when we report our fiscal second quarter results scheduled for November. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."
