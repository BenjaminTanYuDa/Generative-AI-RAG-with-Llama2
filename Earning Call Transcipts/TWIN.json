[Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Mr. Jeff Knutson, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin your conference.\nJeff Knutson: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fiscal 2024 second quarter results. On the call with me today is John Batten, Twin Disc's CEO. I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made during this conference call, especially statements expressing hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. It is important to remember that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K, copies of which may be obtained by contacting either the company or the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that are made during this call are based on assumptions as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements to reflect subsequent events or new information. During today's call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, please see the earnings release issued earlier today. By now, you should have received the news release, which was issued this morning before the market opened. If you have not received a copy, please call our office at 262-638-4000 and we will send the release to you. Now I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Batten: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. Let's begin today's call with some highlights. We continued our solid momentum in the second quarter, delivering profitable growth by generating historically high cash from operations. These results were driven in large part by strong operational execution by our teams, coupled with our continued focus on working capital improvement. We are seeing ongoing strength both in Marine and Propulsion and Land-Based Transmission supporting 15.2% year-over-year sales growth to continue our trend of double-digit top line expansion in fiscal 2024. We also delivered solid gross margin expansion, which improved 140 basis points to 28.3%. We're also seeing continued backlog growth as our teams work to capture stable end market demand. One particular highlight has been significant increase in orders for workboat marine transmissions at Asia Pacific, a return to activity in a market after cyclical softness in the offshore Asian market. Moving on to results by product group. Sales in Marine and Propulsion Systems increased 29%, driven by growing activity in global commercial markets. We are seeing further increases in defense spending, driving patrol boat projects, which we expect to continue given current geopolitical turmoil. Veth backlog remained at record levels, rising 6% sequentially and supported by the success of the Veth and Rolla partnership. Veth inventory has increased in the near term as we prepare to meet increased demand heading into the second half of the fiscal year. On to the Land-Based Transmissions business. Sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by rising activity in the oil and gas markets. We're encouraged to see our first new unit orders in North America within oil and gas and expect further strength for this part of the business in the coming quarters. ARFF has also performed well with a strong demand for these transmissions supporting continued trajectory of backlog growth. Looking broadly at the segment, orders are continuing to trend upwards, and we have seen early signs of improvement in spare parts orders after previously reporting a pullback due to end market uncertainty in the first quarter. Our Industrial segment has remained pressured by softness amongst industrial OEM customers with sales declining 13% versus the prior year. We have continued to see sluggish demand for lower-content commoditized product where demand has remained steady for sophisticated higher-content products. Despite this near-term softness, we remain focused on capturing opportunities to partner with major domestic OEMs on a range of products. Next, I'll speak to inventory and backlog. Our backlog has continued to increase, driven by solid demand across our end markets, along with the impact of supply chain improvements made over the past year to enable faster shipment deliveries. We are also seeing a temporary increase in inventory as a percentage of backlog, mainly due to the near-term increase in Veth inventories mentioned earlier. That said, we expect to see inventories fall in the second half of the fiscal year as we work through our current backlog and remain focused on driving inventory as a percentage of backlog lower in the coming quarters. I'd like to briefly address our long-term strategy before Jeff takes us through the financial detail. We aim to position Twin Disc as a leading provider of hybrid and electrification solutions for marine and off-highway land-based applications. In recent quarters, we have made great strides in rationalizing and modernizing our business, helping deliver improved shipments while lowering inventory cost and lead times to create better results for all stakeholders. We are maintaining our focus on controls and systems integration, shifting our business into new avenues that will bring us profitable growth. With the support of our strong balance sheet, we are also continuously evaluating M&A opportunities to grow our business within the industrial and marine technology sectors, both of which ample opportunities for us to expand our offerings in the hybrid and electrification space. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jeff to discuss the financials. Jeff?\nJeff Knutson: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We delivered sales of $73 million for the quarter, up $9.6 million or 15.2% from the prior year period as overall demand remained strong. Net income attributable to Twin Disc for the second quarter was $900,000 or $0.07 per diluted share compared to $1.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Gross profit margin increased to 28.3% compared to 26.9% during the prior year period, and gross profit increased 21.3% to $20.7 million. This improvement reflects the benefit of prior pricing actions, continued easing of supply chain headwinds, a favorable product mix and successfully executing our operational playbook. Marine and Propulsion Systems reported double-digit growth and Land-Based Transmissions reported 8% growth, while Industrial sales declined compared to the prior year period. Looking at top line distribution across geographies. Sales continued to increase across the Asia Pacific and European regions compared to the prior year, supported by robust demand, while North American sales declined. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet through the solid cash generation delivered in the second quarter. We reduced net debt by $21.7 million to negative $3.3 million compared to the prior year period and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $21 million, approximately $7.5 million higher versus the prior year period. EBITDA decreased to $5.5 million from $7 million during the prior year period due to a $4.2 million prior year gain on the sale of a facility recorded in the second quarter of 2023. We continued to decrease our leverage ratio this quarter to below negative 0.6x, putting us in an excellent position to invest in our business while executing inorganic growth opportunities. As noted earlier, gross profit margin for the second quarter increased to 28.3%, expanding approximately 140 basis points from the prior year period, again, due to the benefit of pricing actions, continued easing of supply chain headwinds, a favorable product mix and successful execution of our operational playbook. Our improved supply chain has continued to enable stronger shipments. However, we have faced some currency headwinds and higher labor costs within ME&A. That being said, while ME&A spend has increased nominally, it has decreased as a percentage of sales as we continue to grow our business. Now on to capital allocation. In line with the additional priorities specified in our capital allocation framework, given our low debt level, we are exploring M&A opportunities with a specific emphasis on marine technology, industrial and the hybrid electric sector, as John mentioned. Simultaneously, we are making strategic investments within the company, including research and development, expansion into new geographic areas and continued strengthening of our marketing efforts. As always, we are pleased to consistently return capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividend payments. We will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy and priorities, adjusting to changes in the economic landscape in their operating environment as they evolve. I'd like to now turn the call back over to John to share some closing remarks.\nJohn Batten: Thanks, Jeff. Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to highlight a few key takeaways from our quarterly results. In summary, we're seeing stable end market demand, advancing our momentum of double-digit revenue growth, robust margin expansion and cash generation. We are focused on maintaining the operational improvements that have supported these results, including disciplined working capital management. Despite lingering macroeconomic uncertainty, we hold a cautiously optimistic outlook towards the remainder of our fiscal year, given strengthening demand levels in our end markets. Our consistent performance will continue to strengthen our financial profile, giving us the ability to work through potential challenges while pursuing growth opportunities. I'd like to thank all of our teams for their hard work and commitment to supporting our business this quarter. We look forward to sustaining this progress as we drive Twin Disc forward and generate long-term value for our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Jeff and I will now be happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simon Wong from Gabelli Funds.\nSimon Wong: Look, first question, you saw some nice growth in your Land-Based Transmissions business. How much of that was from the oil patch?\nJeff Knutson: I would say the oil patch was relatively consistent. I think it was probably split between our ARFF and our oil patch on the Transmissions side.\nSimon Wong: So 50-50, so about $7 million, $8 million?\nJeff Knutson: I think that's about right, yes.\nSimon Wong: Okay. Now you say -- you mentioned that you saw higher activity or you received your first new equipment order from the North America. Is that for the new E-frac? Or was that for the diesel-based transmission?\nJohn Batten: Yes, Simon, the new unit orders were for traditional diesel frac. We are still awaiting the first PO for the E-frac. I'm hoping that happens yet this quarter. But so far, all the new unit orders and obviously, all the spare parts orders remain for North America and Asia. And our business in Asia keeps chugging along at a very good rate this quarter compared to a year ago.\nSimon Wong: Okay. Now that $8 million from the oil patch, is that mostly because -- I mean, you did mention some new units going to Asia. Is that more due to consumables? Or I mean, how does that break down between consumable and new equipment?\nJohn Batten: So I would say in the quarter, the revenue growth was more in new units to Asia and a little bit less on spare parts. So the mix of new units, spare parts was higher in the second quarter than it had been in the previous quarters. So we saw a little bit of slowdown in rebuild activity and an uptick and new unit activity.\nSimon Wong: Okay. And then your E-frac offering, you're still waiting for the first purchase order. What's been the feedback from your customers?\nJohn Batten: The feedback has been great. It's been -- it's -- the testing has gone extremely well. I'll be honest, I'm surprised we haven't had the order yet, but I think we're just working out some details and some financing for the customer. And that's where we stand. But we remain ready and we're geared up for production. We could react very quickly.\nSimon Wong: Okay. Got it. And then in Veth, you saw some really nice geographic expansion growth -- or growth in geographic expansion last year. It looks like it continued this quarter. How much more room is there to expand geographically?\nJohn Batten: Quite a bit. There's -- I mean, we've just scratched the surface in North America and Asia. We had shipments to Australia last fiscal year -- or actually, trying to think, that might have been the first quarter. But again, just scratching the surface, particularly in the ELITE product line, the combination of the Rolla-designed thruster and propeller. The mega yacht market, they don't just build in Europe, they build around the world. So we're looking to expand that. So we have -- actually, we do have some -- just supply, I would say, production constraints in the Netherlands that we're trying to solve here in the U.S. So once we get that behind us, I think we'll see some more geographic expansion as well. But we've got some things to work out so that we can grow the top line. It's production-wise, capacity-wise.\nSimon Wong: Okay. All right. A couple of questions for Jeff. We saw gross margin expand nicely year-over-year, but it did take a step back from the first quarter. How do you see gross margin progressing for the rest of the year?\nJeff Knutson: Yes. I think it's going to be right around the range between Q1 and Q2, depending on mix. Like John mentioned, our aftermarket mix, especially oil and gas aftermarket, in Q2 was a little bit lower than we've seen in previous quarters and that has a little bit of a drag on margin. We did see an uptick in orders as we closed out the quarter. So that was a positive sign. So I think it's going to be in this range and kind of what we've said before, in the high 20s, trying to get to 30% is what we would expect.\nSimon Wong: Okay. One more question, if I could sneak one more in. What's your CapEx for the full year -- CapEx outlook for the full year?\nJeff Knutson: Yes. I think $10 million. We've been pretty consistently targeting $10 million. I think we've got a run rate so far, I guess, that's pretty close. So unlike maybe some previous years where it was really back end loaded, I think we've got orders in place to get us right around that $10 million, maybe a little bit less.\nJohn Batten: Yes, Simon. Yes, there’s more on order, but the lead times for machine tools, gear grinders, they’re still out over 12 months. So we have big machine tools on order, but they’re not coming in until next fiscal year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Greene from Neuberger.\nRand Gesing: Do you hear me guys? This is actually Rand. Great. So look, if we use the Q2 like $5.5 million of EBITDA, how would you guys expect sort of the second half quarters to behave so we get to -- we see additional top line.\nJeff Knutson: Yes. I think we'll be up. I think we've been hovering around $30 million trailing 12-month EBITDA. I think we'll grow through the second half. So getting through the second half back up to like $7.5 million to $8 million.\nRand Gesing: Okay. Great. And given the backlog plus what you're hearing about end markets, you guys -- I'm assuming you feel pretty good about the second half, having growth revenues year-over-year. Is that the case? And I was wondering about next year if you have any sort of visibility on continued top line growth year-over-year?\nJohn Batten: Yes. Rand, it's John. I think we've -- given our backlog and what we're -- what we saw in orders in the second quarter and some feedback we're getting in the first quarter, we're obviously pretty optimistic. The backlog is there for the second half do very well. It's just a question of the unforeseen surprises in the supply chain, things taking longer to get to us because of concerns in the Middle East and shipping taking longer. But the backlog is there to have a very nice second quarter. We're reading everything that you're reading about soft landing, recession in our market in the second half of the year, the beginning of our next fiscal year. So far, Rand, our orders and what we're hearing from our customers, there's a little bit of that, but we're also seeing some optimism in markets that had been quiet for a long time. And I mentioned in my comments, the Asian marine market, particularly tugs, whether it's for mining, seem to be doing very well. So I think, for us, it's too soon to tell, but we're probably a little bit more optimistic than most going into our fiscal '25.\nRand Gesing: Okay. Great. Let’s leave it there. I’m still trying to get out and visit with you guys when the weather gets a little better. But great work on repositioning the company.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. As we have no further questions at this time, we will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."

Now I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Batten: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call. Let's begin today's call with some highlights. We had an impressive start to the new fiscal year, building off the positive momentum generated in the fourth quarter to deliver growth in many of our markets. Throughout the first fiscal quarter, our global teams worked to capture stable demand for our products, drive increased shipments and resulting in a 13.7% year-over-year sales growth. We also achieved robust gross margin expansion, improving 240 basis points to 26.2%, despite incurring a onetime charge of $3.1 million, along with significant increases in EBITDA and cash generation. Owing to our improved financial position, I am pleased to announce that the Board has approved reinstating a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share. These results are largely due to hard work on the part of our team, taking a disciplined approach in executing on operational priorities. Our Singapore-based sales team performed exceptionally well to drive growth and further expand our presence in Chinese market, especially the oil and gas one. We ended the quarter with continued backlog growth, underscored by a record backlog in our airport rescue and firefighting transmission business, while inventories favorably declined. That also continues to perform strongly, driven by further growth beyond its core Northern European markets into North America and the Asia Pacific region. Shifting to our product group, we saw strong demand in our marine and propulsion systems, with increased activity in global commercial markets driving 24% growth in sales. Production at our Belgium facility is already at capacity this fiscal year with projects booked through August 2024. Patrol boat projects grew in line with increased government defense spending, a trend which we expect may continue due to ongoing geopolitical turmoil, an uptick in what is called fleet readiness typically supports the aftermarket business as countries focused on repair and maintenance in times of uncertainty. Coming off record levels last quarter, that 6-month backlog increased 17% sequentially. The collaboration between Veth and Rolla continues to be a highlight of the mega yacht market, representing a major long-term growth driver and as sales trend higher. This partnership gives us a competitive edge and unlocked opportunities within both new and established markets. On to the land-based transmission business, sales grew 17% year-over-year, driven by higher demand from the oil and gas market. Within ARFF, orders are coming in for our transmission built in the Racine facility helped driving the record backlog I mentioned earlier. We are seeing a general increase in orders across the land-based transmission segment. That said, we started to see early indications of a pullback in spare parts orders, indicating that customers might be taking a more cautious approach amidst the uncertainties in the macro environment. Demand has softened within the industrial product leading to a 19% decline in sales versus the prior year despite sourcing and supply chain headwinds having eased. This sluggish demand is largely tied to lower content commoditized products, including construction and irrigation equipment. We are still seeing solid increase in demand for higher content, more sophisticated products, underscored by a new business award we received on a large shredder application with a major customer of [indiscernible]. Despite some near-term softness, we remain focused on capturing opportunities to partner with major domestic OEMs on a range of products. Now turning to our inventory and backlog. Throughout the quarter, the gradual alleviation of supply chain headwinds, coupled with solid operational execution has helped us make significant progress driving increased shipments. These supply chain improvements have been a major factor in enabling us to complete system build and deliver shipments in a reasonable time frame. We also continue to drive inventory lower during the quarter, driven in part by the asset sale I brought up earlier. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to address our long-term strategy. As we work to move our business forward, we are always focused on keeping our actions aligned with our strategic priorities. We aim to become a leading provider of hybrid and electrification solutions for marine and off-highway land-based applications as we advanced our relationships and collaboration with major OEMs. Veth reach continues to expand on a global scale, driven in part by the successful partnership with Rolla. We are making solid progress to rationalize and modernize our business, helping deliver improved shipments while lowering inventory costs and lead times while creating better results for all stakeholders. Our focus remains on controls and systems integration, shifting our business into new avenues that will bring us profitable growth. And with regards to M&A, we are actively looking into the industrial and marine technology sectors, both of which have ample opportunities for us to expand our offerings in the hybrid and electrification space. In closing, while we are extremely encouraged by our results this quarter, it is important to note that broader macroeconomic environment remains volatile, somewhat limiting our visibility into the coming quarters. With that in mind, our performance continues to strengthen our financial profile, bolstering our ability to work through potential challenges while we stay on track to drive long-term growth. With that, I will now turn it over to Jeff to discuss the financials. Jeff?\nJeff Knutson: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We delivered sales of $63.6 million for the quarter, up $7.6 million or 13.7% from the prior year as overall demand remained strong as shipments increased. Net loss attributable to Twin Disc for the quarter was $1.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a loss of $1.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Gross profit margin increased to 26.2% compared to [indiscernible] for the same period of fiscal '23. Gross profit was negatively impacted by a $3.1 million noncash accounting item related to the sale of an asset during the quarter. Both marine and propulsion systems and land-based transmissions reported a double-digit growth, while industrial sales declined. Looking at top line distribution across geographies, sales increased significantly across the Asia Pacific and European regions compared to the prior year, supported by robust demand, while North American sales declined. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet through the solid cash generation delivered in the first quarter. We reduced net debt by approximately $4.1 million to $1.2 million and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $20.4 million, $7.2 million higher versus the prior quarter end. EBITDA is up significantly to $2.3 million from $600,000 during the same period last year due to higher revenues, favorable product mix, the impact of prior pricing actions and the successful execution of our operational playbook. Furthermore, we continued to decrease our leverage ratio this quarter to below 1x EBITDA. Gross profit margin of 26.2% increased approximately 240 basis points from the prior year period. Adjusting for the noncash impairment I previously mentioned, gross profit margin for the first quarter would be approximately 30%. This reflects the benefit of prior pricing actions, continued easing of supply chain headwinds, a favorable product mix and successful execution of our operational playbook. With regards to inflationary headwinds, commodities have largely stabilized, and we have also seen some reductions in freight and fuel surcharges. As John highlighted, we are pleased to be in a position to resume paying a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share this quarter, payable on December 1 to shareholders of record on November 17. Consistent with the additional priorities outlined in our capital allocation framework, we are actively exploring acquisition opportunities, focusing on marine technology, industrial and the hybrid electric space. And currently, we will continue to make investments within the business in the form of research and development, geographic diversification and enhancement of our marketing initiatives. We will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy and priorities as the economic backdrop in our operating environment continue to evolve. I'd like to now turn the call back over to John to share some closing remarks.\nJohn Batten: Thanks, Jeff. Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to highlight a few key takeaways from our first quarter performance. In summary, we're seeing stable end market demand supporting our robust margin expansion and strong cash generation that supported the reinstatement of our quarterly dividend. Operationally, we continue to increase backlog by taking a disciplined approach to inventory management, with inventory as a percentage of backlog declining. Supply chain headwinds have generally subsided largely due to effective actions taken by management over the prior quarters. With all of these factors combined, we have enhanced our financial profile and strengthened our balance sheet, giving us the flexibility to manage through any challenges that may come along in this uncertain operating environment. We continue to make progress towards our target, solidifying our financial position and driving long-term value creation for our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Jeff and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator:\nJohn Batten: Thanks, Josh. We hope that Jeff and I have answered all of your questions today, if not, please feel free to reach out to us directly, and we look forward to talking to you in February after the close of our third quarter conference call. Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.\nQ - :\nA - :"
