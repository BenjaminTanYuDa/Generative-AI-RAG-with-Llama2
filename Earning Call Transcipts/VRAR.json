A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. The earnings release that accompanies this call is available on the Investors section of the company's website at https://ir.theglimpsegroup.com/. Before we begin the formal presentation, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made on today's call and webcast, including those regarding future financial results and industry prospects are forward-looking and may be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the call. Please refer to the company's regulatory filings for a list of associated risks, and we would also refer you to the company's website for more supporting industry information. I would now like to hand the call over to Lyron Bentovim, President and CEO of The Glimpse Group. Lyron, the floor is yours.\nLyron Bentovim: Thank you, everyone, for joining us. I am pleased to welcome you to The Glimpse Group's second quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results investor call for quarter ended December 31, 2023. During this quarter, we made substantial progress on our strategic realignment of Glimpse towards providing immersive enterprise software and services that are driven by Spatial Computing, Cloud and AI or Spatial Core as we refer to it internally, led by our subsidiary company, Brightline Interactive. As a reminder, we strongly believe that in order for the immersive industry to reach true scale, the compute must be processed in the cloud and not on the headsets or computing device. To reach its full potential, we believe that immersive technology must evolve from worlds and experiences created by humans for consumption by humans to synthetic world whose creation is directed by humans, executed by AI in the cloud and whose consumption is for both humans and non-humans such as robots, drones and AI avatars. This is one of the key philosophies behind Spatial Core and an important competitive advantage if we are to be at the center of this. We are not making this journey alone. We are working closely with some of the largest players in the tech industry such as NVIDIA and Microsoft, as well as with some of the leading hardware players in the space. We serve as middleware, connecting their cloud and AI technologies and services with the needs of enterprises and organizations creating a win-win-win. Our Spatial Core pipeline continues to grow rapidly with several multi-million dollar contracts that are very close to the goal line. These contracts are with multiple of Department of Defense entities as well as large enterprises and organizations and will be initially executed over the next 12 to 18 months with a potential for significant recurring software components after that. While we cannot guarantee that these opportunities will materialize into signed contracts, we have good reason to believe that they will in the coming weeks and months. And when they do, the impact on Glimpse should be transformative. In parallel, the immersive industry continues to develop as demonstrated by the recent launch of the Apple Vision Pro. The Apple Vision Pro pushes immersive experiences to the next level and engages with new audiences. The headset's launch has ignited new interest in immersive solutions, and we have started working with a variety of customers, ranging from federal agencies to large and small enterprises on a variety of enterprise applications and use cases. As we discussed in our last call, we expected our strategic transition to result in short-term reduction in revenues as we divested and shut down noncore operating assets and reduced our expenses targeting other nonessential opportunities. We expect this revenue decline to stabilize in Q1 of calendar year 2024 and growth to resume in calendar Q2 of 2024 as we ramp up Spatial Core revenues and as our other remaining subsidiary companies execute on their growth plans. Our other major subsidiary companies, QReal, Sector 5 Digital and the newly formed Glimpse Learning are focused on enterprise use cases, including lifelike 3D modeling, robust augmented reality experiences, virtual reality corporate training and education, both for health care, K-12, higher learning. Recent customer contracts include Walmart, Colgate and NYU Langone Hospital to name a few. As Maydan will detail in his prepared remarks, while we have increased our investment in Spatial Core, we have also taken major steps to reduce our operating expense base. We are now positioned to reach profitability when we return to prior revenue levels. We will continue to monitor our expense base and adjust it as needed in a prudent manner. With that, I will now turn it over to Maydan Rothblum, Glimpse's CFO and COO, to review the financial results. Maydan?\nMaydan Rothblum: Thanks, Lyron. I will limit my portion to a summary review of our financial results. A full breakdown is available in our 10-Q and in the press release that were filed after market closed today. Please note that I'll refer to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. For the calculation of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures, please refer to the MD&A section of our 10-Q filings, which you can find on our website under SEC Filings. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $2.08 million compared to approximately $2.95 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 29%. Revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $5.18 million compared to approximately $6.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 25%. This decline is in line with our previously announced expectations as we continue to, A, strategically transition our business from predominantly immersive, marketing-driven projects to enterprise scale, spatial computing, cloud, AI-driven immersive recurring software solutions; and B, as we divest noncore operating assets. Gross margin for Q2 fiscal year 2024 was approximately 68% compared to 70% for Q2 fiscal year 2023. As we complete our strategic transition, we expect our gross margins to continue to remain in the 65% to 70% range and potentially increase afterwards. While investing in the development of our Spatial Core solutions, we are continuing to reduce noncore cash expenses. In the aggregate, we have reduced cash expenses by approximately 50% from their high. Our operational cash breakeven point is now approximately $3 million revenue per quarter or $12 million annually, excluding potential growth investments. For relative reference, our Q1 fiscal year 2024 revenue was $3.1 million and our fiscal year 2023 annual revenue was approximately $13.5 million. Figures that we believe are attainable once some of the large contracts we have in the pipeline materialize. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.33 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.6 million loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $3.64 million loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The reduced EBITDA loss for both periods was driven by the cash operating – by the reduction in cash operating expenses. As of December 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 million. The company has no outstanding corporate debt or preferred equity obligations. I'd now like to pass it back to Lyron for some closing remarks, after which we will begin our Q&A session.\nLyron Bentovim: Thank you, Maydan. Our Spatial Core initiative could open up new frontiers for immersive technology and is a key element in our future. We are making significant progress and expect strong revenue development in the coming months. In parallel, we have positioned our other subsidiary companies to be cash flow positive and achieve profitable growth as they execute on their plans. I thank you all for your interest and support of The Glimpse Group. And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Lyron. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Casey Ryan from WestPark. Casey, your line is live.\nCasey Ryan: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Hey, it was a better quarter than we certainly had expected. So congratulations. That's a good job, I think. Of the $2.1 million, do you consider all of that to be part of the core business and the units that we're sort of building out moving forward? Or do you think there was some revenue from sort of noncore elements built into the quarter?\nLyron Bentovim: Hey, Casey, thank you for joining us and for your question. I would consider all of the revenue that we have in this quarter to be part of the pieces that are moving forward. There's a couple of other things we're in the process of doing, but kind of at this point, all the revenue pieces that we have in the $2.1 million are part of the future of where we're going.\nCasey Ryan: Okay. Great. Terrific. And then the 68% gross margin number, I think, was good and sort of in the range that you've indicated is sort of where we expect the business going forward. On the DoD contracts, which are exciting and sort of meaningful from a revenue perspective, are those similar just in structure or because they're government or is there some other structure that like maybe on – the margins may be sort of a little below corporate or a little above corporate maybe. I'm sort of curious if you can give us some directionality on what the margin profile of those revenues might look like?\nLyron Bentovim: I would initially expect those margins to be in line with our general kind of range. So kind of – as we're working on these kind of – it will vary because they'll have different milestones and kind of different pieces that will come over the next, hopefully, year as we sign these. But the general margin on those contracts should be in that 60% to 70% range initially. And then as we go into the recurring elements down the road, they should be higher.\nCasey Ryan: Okay, terrific. Terrific. And then sort of bigger picture, I think you actually made a really good point about sort of immersive experiences and let's say, tools and techniques, training and different applications need data processing in the cloud, will that be part of the service offering from The Glimpse Group and our subsidiaries as sort of some capability to access that? Or will we just sort of stay in sort of enabling software/middleware type of space and sort of allow all that data processing to happen elsewhere?\nLyron Bentovim: Our partners such as NVIDIA and Microsoft, they've built pretty amazing solutions out there. And kind of what we want to do is tap into those capabilities that are constantly evolving and we get the front row seat to see what they're kind of working on even some of the things that are not in the public domain yet. And then really help our customers, on the other hand, take advantage of these solutions. And kind of that's where we're kind of positioning ourselves. So we don't want to reinvent the wheel and definitely not to compete with our big partners, but we want to take what they're building and enable our customers to use those smartly.\nCasey Ryan: Yes, that makes sense. Okay, terrific. And then one sort of balance sheet question, I guess, there's two components, I guess, as you trim down the business, there's a goodwill figure for about $10 million on the asset side and then a contingent liability number that – between the current and noncurrent, it's about $5 million in terms of contingent liabilities related to acquisitions. Do those numbers change meaningfully as you get rid of noncore assets? Or are those kind of all related to core pieces of the business today?\nLyron Bentovim: So all the ones that are in the balance sheet as of the reported dates are tied to pieces that are part of our business. We're constantly looking at goodwill and kind of I'm not a big fan of the concept, and therefore, we take a kind of pretty aggressive approach to eliminating it when possible. And as we look at the contingent liabilities, they are tied to future performance such that we are expecting, and they will kind of be paid out and some are in equity and some are in cash as those milestones are met.\nCasey Ryan: Yes. Okay. Okay. Good. That's helpful color. And then in terms of the contingent liability piece, what's the mix roughly? Is it 50-50 sort of cash and equity? Or is it sort of 80-20 one way or another? Of course, I can look it up, but I'm asking the teacher for help here.\nLyron Bentovim: I'll defer to Maydan on this one.\nMaydan Rothblum: Yes, the majority of it is cash.\nCasey Ryan: Okay. Great. That's a very helpful answer. Well, thank you. It feels like a constructive quarter. I'll sort of get out of the way here and turn it over to other folks. But thank you for taking my questions.\nMaydan Rothblum: Thank you, Casey.\nOperator: Thank you. There were no other questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Lyron for his closing remarks.\nLyron Bentovim: Thank you. I would like to thank each and every one of you for joining our earnings conference call. We look forward to continuing to update you on an ongoing process and growth. If we were unable to answer any of your questions, please feel free to reach out to us directly. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's webinar. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day."

I would now like to hand the call over to Lyron Bentovim, President and CEO [Technical Difficulty].\nLyron Bentovim: Thank you, everyone for joining us. I am pleased to welcome you to The Glimpse Group’s first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results investor call for quarter ended September 30, 2023. This quarter was highlighted by continued execution on our strategic realignment of Glimpse towards providing immersive enterprise software and services that are driven by spatial computing, cloud and AI. Q1 FY 2024 revenue of approximately $3.1 million, a 7% quarter-over-quarter increase compared to Q4 FY 2023 revenue of approximately $2.9 million and a 22% decrease compared to the record revenue of approximately $3.95 million in Q1 FY 2023. We continue to make strong progress in our previously detailed strategic shift to spatial computing, cloud and AI-driven immersive software solutions. We also expect to announce significant contracts in the coming months. In parallel, we have been realigning the company, reducing head count and our investment in non-core areas while working on divesting non-core assets. As we make this transition, we expect Q2 FY 2024, a quarter are in currently to have lower revenue, but also expect a rebound in Q3 FY 2024, calendar 2024 Q1 revenue as we begin to recognize revenue and growth relating to our special core products and solutions. As I discussed on our last earnings call, we strongly believe that for the immersive industry to reach its full potential and mass scale, it must be untethered from the computing limitations of traditional devices, whether they are VR headset, AR headset tablets and phones. Spatial core developed by our subsidiary company, Brightline Interactive is the technological engine that allows us to simultaneously integrate legacy immersive technology systems with state-of-the-art cloud systems built on open standards for accelerated computing in large scale. By harnessing the essentially infinite scale of GPU access provided by our partners in WIDIA and Microsoft, Brightline is creating powerful AI workflows for massive and quick compression of complex simulations and immersive experiences, which are computed in the cloud in real time and then deliver to the end devices. Live examples of this include robotics training, digital twin based simulations, rapid immersive content creation and multiple Department of Defense applications. Spatial core will be the growth engine of Glimpse and as such, we are realigning the business to reflect that, including divestiture or shutdown of non-core activities and subsidiaries. The subsidiary companies that remain primarily QReal and S5D are expected to be net positive cash contributors. As Maydan will detail in his prepared remarks, we have taken significant steps to reduce our operating expense base. Recently raised capital in clean structure and continue to maintain a clean balance sheet. With that, I will now turn it over to Maydan Rothblum, Glimpse’s CFO and COO to review the financial results. Maydan?\nMaydan Rothblum: Thanks, Lyron. I will limit my portion to a summary review of our financial results, a full breakdown is available in our 10-Q and in the press release that were filed after market close today. Please note that I'll refer to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. For the calculation of adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures, please refer to the MD&A section of our 10-Q filing, which you can find on our website under SEC filings. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was approximately $3.1 million compared to approximately $3.95 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of approximately 22%. The decrease reflects Q1 fiscal year 2022 being our record revenue quarter. In addition to the effects of our internal structuring and a lengthening of our sales cycle in general in the immersive technology industry. Gross margin for Q1 fiscal year 2024 was approximately 62% compared to 69% for Q1 fiscal year 2023. We expect our gross margins to continue to remain in the 60% to 70% range depending on the revenue mix in a specific quarter and we expect our margins to be at the higher end of the range in the second half of the fiscal year as our strategic shift comes into place. Adjusted EBITDA loss for Q1 fiscal year 2024 was approximately $1.29 million compared to an EBITDA loss of approximately $1.05 million for Q1 fiscal year 2023, which had a higher revenue base. In the past year, we have reduced headcount by approximately 40% and will continue to do so as part of our strategic plan. This will enable us to going forward, reach cash flow neutrality at approximately this quarter's level of revenues annualized, excluding growth investments. Just to illustrate, a year ago, our cash breakeven point was approximately $20 million of annual revenue. Today, we are approaching cash breakeven at approximately $12 million of annual revenue. After the closing of the previously reported registered direct financing on October 3, 2023, the company's cash position was in excess of $6.5 million. As Lyron mentioned, the company has no outstanding corporate debt, convertible debt or preferred equity obligations. On November 13, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the company to enter into a common share repurchase buyback plan of up to $2 million to be utilized over the next three years. Since we are committed to investing in the growth opportunities in front of us in the operations of the business, we do not anticipate utilizing this plan once it has been put in place in the next week or so. That being said, we may utilize the buyback in cases where extraordinary circumstances regarding our stock price create exceptional value opportunities for the company. I'd now like to pass it back to Lyron for some closing remarks, after which we will begin our Q&A session.\nLyron Bentovim: Thank you, Maydan. Our special core initiative has the potential to be a key enabler for the immersive industry's transformation from a hardware-centric solutions to those driven by cloud compute and AI. We are all in on this initiative, focusing our R&D efforts on bringing solutions based on this technology to market in 2024, with the other remaining Glimpse subsidiary company is expected to support this effort by generating positive cash contributions. We continue to make strong progress in the development of the underlying special core technologies and in addition to the previously announced customer contracts we expect significant contracts to materialize in the coming months. In parallel, we have made large strides towards reaching cash neutrality at the current level of revenues and have a clean balance sheet to support our growth investments. I thank you all for your interest and support of Glimpse Group. And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Lyron. [Operator Instructions] There are no questions coming. We do have a question from Casey Ryan with WestPark Capital. Please pose your question. Your line is live.\nCasey Ryan: Gentlemen, thanks for the update today. I think when you announced the initial restructuring, you were talking, there are sort of multiple entities that you may be looking to do take strategic actions with. Do you have any update on that or any sense of like how much value there is in those or the opportunities or interest from other parties around sort of what deemed as non-core now moving forward?\nLyron Bentovim: Thank you for your question, Casey. So we are in the process of looking at the companies we have, understanding which one of these should stay within Glimpse and continue to operate. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, generate cash flow that will drive our company forward and which ones are better off kind of being on the outside and then exploring the right structure. So we haven't kind of got into full decision point on those yet, and we will update probably in the coming quarters as kind of the progress around that.\nCasey Ryan: Yes. Maybe my thinking was too short on the time line of those. So it sounds like maybe this is sort of a 12-month process, not sort of a three-month process, I think.\nLyron Bentovim: Probably closer to three months than 12 months, but we just had our kind of strategic realignment call a month ago. So we're still working on that.\nCasey Ryan: No, I'm not trying to pressure you, but I'm excited to get the update. So – and then the other question, it sounds like you have some visibility into what the revenue shape looks like. Is that a change? Or is that related to maybe one specific opportunity that you have high probability on. I'm just sort of curious if like as you change the business and focus on the spatial core opportunities that maybe your visibility is extending out in some fashion?\nLyron Bentovim: Yeah. No, I actually think that as we transition the business, we will have more visibility since some of these engagements will be more of a long-term nature, and we will be able to see the revenue and the work that will be done over the period. So I do see more visibility now than we had in previous quarters.\nCasey Ryan: Okay. Good. Well, that's exciting. That's it for me right now. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks for the update.\nLyron Bentovim: Thank you, Casey.\nOperator: At this time, we'll turn to some write-in questions. Again, if you'd like to ask a question, please use the chat function.\nLyron Bentovim: I do not see any writing questions, so I would like to thank each and every one of you for joining our earnings conference call. We look forward to continuing to update you on our ongoing progress and growth. If we were unable to answer any of your questions, please reach out to us directly. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's webinar. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time."
