With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Richard Soloway, President and CEO of NAPCO Security Technologies. Dick, the floor is yours.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you, Fran. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our results. We are pleased to report our fiscal Q2 2024 record sales of $47.5 million. This is the 13th consecutive quarter we've achieved record sales for the quarterly period. Recurring revenue subscription service continues to grow at a very strong rate and the annual prospective run rate is now $76.5 million based on January 2024 recurring revenues. Our balance sheet remains strong with our cash balances at $79 million, an 18% increase over the June 30, 2023 level. We have no debt. We continue to focus on capitalizing on key industry trends, which include wireless fire and intrusion alarms and the related recurring service revenues, school security solutions, plus enterprise access control systems and architectural locking products. The management team here at NAPCO continues to focus on the key metrics of growth, profits, and returns on equity, as well as controlling our costs. These metrics are important to us, as well as our shareholders. We continue to execute our business strategy, and our interests are aligned with our shareholders as senior management of NAPCO owns approximately 10% of the equity. Before I go into greater detail, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevin Buchel. He will provide an overview of our fiscal second quarter results, and then, I will be back with more on our strategies and view of our markets. Kevin, the floor is yours.\nKevin Buchel: Thank you, Dick. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the quarter increased 12% to $47.5 million, and that's the highest quarterly sales in the company's history. And that compares to $42.3 million for the same period one year ago. Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased 9% to a six-month record of $89.2 million, and that compares to $81.8 million for the same period one year ago. Recurring monthly service revenue continued its strong growth, increasing 25% in Q2 to $18.5 million as compared to $14.9 million for the same period last year. Recurring monthly service revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased 25% to $35.8 million as compared to $28.7 million last year. Recurring service revenues now have a prospective annual run rate of approximately $76.5 million based on January 2024 recurring revenues, and that compares to $72.5 million based on October 2023 recurring service revenues, which we reported back in November. Equipment sales for the quarter increased 6% to $29 million as compared to $27.4 million last year. This increase was due primarily to revenue increases in both Alarm Lock and Marks brand door-locking products, as well as increased sales of NAPCO brand intrusion products. Of note is that the StarLink radios sales in Q2 sequentially increased over those sales in Q1 by 63%. Equipment sales for the six months increased 1% to $53.4 million as compared to $53.1 million for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to increases in both Alarm Lock and Marks locking sales as -- offset by a decrease in NAPCO intrusion sales due to the previously discussed decline in StarLink radios. Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased 74% to $25 million with a gross margin of 53% as compared to $14.4 million with a gross margin of 34% for the same period last year. And the gross profit for the six months increased 64% to $47.4 million with a gross margin of 53% as compared to $28.9 million with a gross margin of 35% a year ago. Gross profit for recurring service revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $16.7 million with a gross margin of 90%, and that compares to $13.2 million with a gross margin of 89% last year. And gross profit for recurring service revenue for the six months increased 21% to $32.2 million with a gross margin of 90%, as compared to $25.4 million with a gross margin of 88% last year. Gross profit for equipment revenues in Q2 increased 633% to $8.4 million with a gross margin of 29%, as compared to $1.1 million with a gross margin of 4% last year. And gross profit for equipment revenues for the six months increased 328% to $15.2 million with a gross margin of 29%, as compared to $3.6 million with a gross margin of 7% for the same period last year. The increase in both gross profit dollars and gross margin for recurring revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of the previously mentioned increase in recurring revenues, as well as a greater proportion of those revenues being generated by our StarLink Fire radios, which generate higher monthly service charges than the other StarLink radios. The increase in both gross profit dollars and gross margin for equipment revenues for both the three and the six months ended December 31, 2023, primarily resulted from lower costs of certain components as compared to the same period last year when we were still feeling the effects of the global supply chain shortage. In addition, the aforementioned increase in equipment sales was also a factor in the increase in gross profit and gross margin. Research and development costs for the quarter increased 14% to $2.5 million, or 5% of sales, and that compares to $2.2 million, or 5% of sales, for the same period a year ago. And research and development costs for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased 7% to $5 million, or 6% of sales, and that compares to $4.7 million, or 6% of sales, for the same period a year ago. The increase for the three and the six months primarily resulted from compensation increases and additional staff. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 11% to $8.7 million or 18% of net sales. And that compares to $7.8 million, or 18% of net sales, for the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased 5% to $17.1 million, or 19% of net sales, and that compares to $16.3 million, or 20% of sales, for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A for the three months was primarily due to increases in legal and advertising expenses, as well as additional expenses relating to the enhancing of our internal control systems. The increase for the six months was primarily due to legal and accounting fees, as well as the aforementioned enhancing of our internal control systems. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales for both the three and the six months was due to the increase in net sales being proportionately larger than the increase in SG&A expenses. Operating income for the quarter increased 219% to $13.8 million as compared to $4.3 million for the same period last year. Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased 218% to $25.4 million as compared to $8 million for the same period last year. Interest and other income for the three months increased 290% to $729,000 as compared to $187,000 last year. And for the six months, interest and other income increased by $1.1 million to $1.2 million compared to $84,000 last year. The increase for both the three and the six months ended December 31, 2023 was due to increased interest income from certificates of deposits. The provision for income taxes for the three months increased by $1.3 million to $1.9 million with an effective tax rate of 13%, as compared to $586,000 with an effective tax rate of 13% last year. And for the six months, the provision for income tax has increased by $2.4 million to $3.4 million with an effective tax rate of 13%, as compared to $1.047 million with an effective tax rate of 13%. The increase in the provision for both the three and the six months ended December 31, 2023 was due to increases in taxable income. Net income for the quarter increased 221% to a quarterly record $12.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. And that compares to $3.9 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the same period last year. And that represents 27% of net sales. Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased 229% to a six-month record of $23.1 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. And that compares to $7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period last year. And that represents 26% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 191% to a quarterly record $15.1 million or $0.41 per diluted share. And that compares to $5.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. And that equates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased 182% to a six-month record $28 million, or $0.76 per diluted share. And that compares to $9.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the same period last year, and equates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 31%. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the company had $79 million in cash and cash equivalents, other investments and marketable securities, and that compares to $66.7 million at June 30, 2023. That's an 18% increase. Company had no debt as of December 31, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $18.7 million. And that compares to $1.1 million for the same period last year. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. It was $128.5 million on December 31, 2023, and that compares with working capital of $111.7 million at June 30, 2023. The current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 7.1 to 1 at December 31, 2023, and 6.7 to 1 at June 30, 2023. CapEx for the quarter was $426,000, and that compares to $444,000 in the prior-year period. That concludes my formal remarks, and I would now like to return the call back to Dick.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you, Kevin. The first half of fiscal 2024 is off to a great start with fiscal Q1 and fiscal Q2 results, achieving record sales and profits, driven by hardware-enabled recurring revenue growth of 25% and which represents approximately 40% of total company revenues. Our net income of $12.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million were quarterly record breakers. Equipment revenue improved, growing 6% for the quarter, with gross margins on such sales sequentially increasing to 29% from 28% last quarter. Radio sales in Q2 improved over Q1, increasing by approximately 63%. While such sales were still 13% below the radio sales of Q2 last year, when the impending 3G Verizon sunset was rapidly approaching, the increase over last quarter was significant. We expect radio sales to continue to be a key contributor to our hardware sales and continue to lead to the continued growth of our highly profitable recurring revenues. Gross margin for recurring service revenues was once again strong at 90%. And when combined with gross margin on equipment revenues of 29%, the total gross margin for Q2 amounted to 53%, which compares to 34% for last year's Q2. We are particularly pleased to see the growth in equipment revenues, which was primarily attributable to the continued strength of locking revenue in addition to the improvement in intrusion sales. We also saw -- we also are pleased with the increase in the recurring revenue's annual run rate, which increased to $76.5 million based on January 2024 recurring revenues, compared to an annual run rate of $72.5 million based on October 2023 recurring revenues. Our Alarm Lock and Marks locking hardware lines continue to see growth in school and classroom security, healthcare, and retail loss prevention, as well as multi-dwelling commercial and residential applications, growing approximately 10% compared to last year and approximately 18% compared to Q1. Locking sales, once again, represented 61% of hardware sales in Q2. We continue to remain focused on further penetrating each of these markets. Net income of $12.6 million, besides being a Q2 record breaker, represents 27% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million, also a Q2 record, represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. We believe we are well on our way to achieving our adjusted EBITDA margin target of approximately 45% on or about the end of fiscal 2026 as our targeted equipment sales reach $150 million and our recurring revenue service level reaches $150 million. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger, with cash and cash equivalents, other investments and marketable securities increasing 18% to $79 million as compared to $66.7 million at June 30, 2023. We have no debt. And the net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ending December 31, 2023 was also strong, amounting to $18.7 million. We recently announced the introduction of Prima by NAPCO, a new all-in-one alarm for security, fire, video and connected home. We anticipate that Prima will address an important mass segment of the security market, including residential and small business systems. With built-in Wi-Fi and cellular radio communications, customer alert notifications, and video and smart home subscription options for each installed system, the security dealer as well as NAPCO can add more recurring revenue generating accounts. There are millions of commercial buildings of all types, such as offices, hospitals, schools, coffee shops, restaurants, as well as residences that still require upgrades from legacy copper phone lines. Our StarLink line of radios have the widest coverage range of both AT&T and Verizon with rich feature sets, which our dealers really love. As we have previously stated, the constraints of the supply chain have abated, and we believe in the coming months that combined with new distributive sources we have developed, we will begin to invigorate our equipment sales and associated margins to even higher levels than any time before. As we've stated previously, the higher the hardware sales, the more overhead absorption occurs in our Dominican Republic factory, and this expands our gross margins. And finally, as indicated in this morning's earnings release, the company will be issuing a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on March 22, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024. This represents a 25% increase over the previous dividend of $0.08 paid on December 22, 2023. We are proud of this program as the NAPCO team has created such tremendous shareholder value over the years, and this is another way for us to distribute profitable growth to our investors. The first six months of fiscal 2024 have generated strong sales and profitability. We believe we can continue this growth well into the future as we work toward our fiscal 2026 goals and targets and beyond. I'd like to thank everyone for their support and for joining us in this exciting future we have. Our formal remarks are now concluded. We would like to open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chad Bennett from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nChad Bennett: Great, thanks. Great job guys on the quarter. Great to see the rebound in the equipment business. So, I guess maybe first question is, I know you touched on it in the formal remarks, just on the radio inventory issue. It seems like it's largely behind us and probably even faster than maybe we thought. Just trying to get an idea, do we still expect some headwind in the March quarter or potentially even in the June quarter from that inventory issue, or how should we think about that?\nKevin Buchel: I think, Chad, that we thought it was going to take a couple of quarters to get it behind us. We thought that this quarter would be affected similarly as it was in Q1. We saw a lot of progress in Q2, and hence you saw the big increase in radio sales in this quarter versus last. We're not done yet. We're not 100% there. We still have some work to do. I think at the end of Q3, it'll be all behind us, but the fact of what's occurred in Q2, there's a lot to getting this issue behind us. And we're going to continue to work hard to make sure there's no issue left by the end of Q3.\nChad Bennett: Right, got it. And then, just shift into the locking side of the business, I think you talked about locking growth of roughly 10% year-over-year. Just in terms of kind of sell-through there and demand there, were there any changes in demand in that business? And then, I think you highlighted the verticals that you're seeing strength in. Should we think about that business differently from a growth rate relative to what you did this quarter, or was this quarter kind of an anomaly there?\nKevin Buchel: Locking has done well for several quarters in a row, maybe last, even, couple of years in a row. So, nothing unusual that gave us the strength. What's great is we have two locking companies. We have Alarm Lock and we have Marks, and both of them are firing on all cylinders. And that's why we're seeing the success in locking. So, we expect that to continue for many quarters to come.\nChad Bennett: Got it. And then, maybe last one for me. EBITDA margins look phenomenal, continue to improve in the low-30%s, I think, again, at least ahead of what I was thinking. I know we had some finance and accounting costs that rolled in this quarter, potentially maybe incrementally more rolling in in the next quarter, but it seems to me like EBITDA margins are likely going from the low-30%s to the mid-30%s in a short period of time. Is that a fair assessment, Kevin?\nKevin Buchel: Yeah, well, we're at 32%. We're well on our way to the 45%. It's going to take more time. We won't get to the 45% obviously by the end of this fiscal year. But when you have 40% of your revenue generating 90% gross margins, which is what we have, the recurring now being roughly 40% of total revenues, that takes you a long way to getting to where we want to go. And we're going to keep adding, obviously, to that recurring. And we think the margins will get better on the hardware as we progress through the rest of the fiscal year. Between those two events, there's no reason why we shouldn't see the EBITDA margin go even higher in this fiscal year.\nChad Bennett: Got it. Thanks. Nice job on the quarter.\nKevin Buchel: Thanks, Chad.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jaeson Schmidt from Lake Street. Please go ahead.\nJaeson Schmidt: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Kevin, just curious if you could share with us some of the sell-through metrics you saw your distributors in the December quarter.\nKevin Buchel: We saw, on the intrusion size, a big improvement from the two distributors who we've been referring to as being the ones that had the excess radio inventory. So that was -- we expected that to occur. It occurred faster than we thought. One in particular, they just did a phenomenal job working their way through. So, their sell-through stats were great. And the sell-through stats for most of the intrusion is much better than it's been. Not back to where it was. No, we're not 100% to where we were, say, a year ago, but we are much better than where we were a quarter ago. And we expect that to continue as we continue to help our distributors promote products, help them move radios. We're coming out with additional radios that are going to give us recurring. So, we're doing a lot of things that are going to help the sell-through. And the sell-through stats with locking continue to do well. We watch all these stats every week, every month. We watch the inventory levels for all of our distributors. We're pretty pleased the way things have been going right now.\nRichard Soloway: We want you to understand that our radios, which generates the recurring subscription revenue, has tremendous opportunities because you have millions of commercial buildings that are still operating on the old legacy copper. And our radios are the best choice for the dealers. They have a lot of features that the dealers like. So, it's really supercharging the Fire radios. Additionally, there's many, many small business residential jobs that need our radios also. So, we make a line of those radios. Millions and millions of jobs are out there that are operating on copper that have to be converted over over the next few years. And then, you have all of our products with the radios built in. The Fire panels, it's built in. The new Prima, it's built in. And those jobs are for new work. So, there's a lot of opportunities for us. And it's a very, very exciting future. And you can feel what's going on by taking a look at our numbers. And we expect this to continue to our 2026 goal of $150 million recurring. So that's the future for us.\nJaeson Schmidt: Okay, that's really helpful. And I know you mentioned that you think the radio inventory issue will be behind you after Q3, but just curious if your own higher cost inventory should largely be chewed through by then as well.\nKevin Buchel: Yes. The higher cost should be behind us. Besides working on inventory at distributors, we're working on getting the inventory that we possess, getting through that as well. And so, if it's not gone by Q3, I think most of it will be, maybe there'll be some in Q4. But most of our inventory now is more normally costed. Days of the crazy high costs caused by the supply chain are mostly behind us.\nJaeson Schmidt: Got you. That's it for me. Thanks a lot, guys.\nKevin Buchel: Thanks, Jaeson.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Co. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Thank you. Question, I wanted to go back again to the sequential growth in radios, and admittedly, this is somewhat of an easy comparison, but to what extent are you seeing any benefit on the radio side from the addition of the new distributor, or is it also just in combination with the improved sell-through in general?\nKevin Buchel: It's both, Jim. So, adding the new distributor certainly helped. But it's not like we loaded up this new distributor and it gave us a one-time hit improvement to radio sales. We didn't do that. We sold this new distributor normal amounts, enough inventory where somebody goes into their distribution center and they have the inventory, not too little, not too much. It's a contributor. But besides that part, the contribution we saw was helping the other distributors move through their inventory. And they move it through, and it creates new demand with the dealers. That's what this is all about. These distributors are just shelves. The bottom line is we have to create demand at the dealer level. Having the new distributor with 115 new branches certainly helps, but also pushing a lot of this inventory through to dealers at all the branches of all the distributors is the biggest factor. And we expect demand to be strong going forward.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hey, Kevin, on the -- I'm sorry, Dick. Go ahead.\nRichard Soloway: There's going to be 30,000 security installation dealers visiting us in Las Vegas, which is the biggest show. And Fran can set people up to come and see the dealers as they come by our booth. It's going to be upfront, it's going to have the widest range of radios, the entire industry right there, all of our new products will be right there. So, we're going to get a lot of leads. And as I said, there's millions of jobs that have to be upgraded from legacy copper. There are huge numbers of jobs of new work that have to be installed. When you're putting up a building, you must have a fire alarm, burglar alarm today, residential alarms, because of what's going on in society. So, we're going to get a lot of dealers, a lot of new leads, and we have a great sales group of guys that are going to follow up on those leads. So, we expect to get even more pull-through between our existing distributor base that we have, plus our new distributor, which is the largest in the security industry, that will generate additional continuous growth of radio sales.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hey, Dick, what kind of traction are you seeing from Prima? I know it's early days yet, but what's the initial read on how the product is doing?\nRichard Soloway: I think that the product has tremendous legs to it. The product is beyond anything else in the security industry with its functionality, ease of installation, goes in in 10 minutes. With what's going on in society, you need an alarm system for your business and you need an alarm system for your home. And the Prima was designed so that the actual salesman that sells the job to the end user customer can install it in less than 15 minutes, very, very quick, or we can leave it behind for the consumer to DIY it if he wants to do that. So I think the opportunities are tremendous. As we said, it takes a year or so for a new product. And this was only developed -- it was only sent to the market a few months ago to become a success. So, we expect that considering the fact that alarms are being put in, and they're a little old fashioned that the competitors have, and this is very, very modern and installed so quickly, this will become a standard of the security industry. And every alarm that goes in that's Prima has a recurring revenue tail to it, so it's going to generate a lot more recurring revenue. Part of our 2026 goal didn't even include it. It was just the existing products. But this will add more to the whole mix of what we're doing.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Final question for me. Kevin, just looking at the expense side, how much of the higher costs for the stepped-up financial controls were in the quarter, or is this going to be more fully reflected in the March quarter? And lastly, just on tax rate, should we assume the similar tax rate?\nKevin Buchel: So, on the first part of your question, Jim, some of the additional costs went into the SG&A in this quarter. We started with Deloitte. Deloitte is now our auditors. So, obviously, that extra cost has started. We've only done one quarter with them, Q2. We have our consulting firm, so that's filtered into the numbers. What you haven't seen yet are the additional employees, the internal auditor, and the additional cost accountants. We're in the process of doing those hires. I expect that will start in Q3, quarter that we're in now. So, we'll see that going forward. And those are recurring expenses, additional employees, as is the Deloitte piece, the consulting [Technical Difficulty]. Our tax rate has been 13%. Every quarter, full year, when I model, I use 15%, but we've been running at 13%. So, unless the laws change, I continue to use 15% for modeling.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay. Thank you.\nRichard Soloway: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Pfau from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions, and nice quarter, guys. I wanted to first ask on the new distributor that you added. Sounds like there was some impact there to hardware in the second quarter. How should we think about that going forward? Is there going to be an inflection or is this more of a slow ramp?\nKevin Buchel: Yeah. Our distributor has been around a long time, this new distributor, with the 115 branches. We dealt with them in the past. They're new to us now. This wasn't a case of loading up, load up all 115 branches, get a big hit, and then things slow down. This is a more normalized ramp up. Whatever impact they had in Qs one and two, we expect it to improve dramatically. They're the biggest security distributor out there. And we've only been dealing with them for a little bit of Q1 and all of Q2. So, the potential is much more than what we've seen. Again, we didn't load them up. It's natural business, which is the way we want it. We don't want to get in a situation where we load them up and then they want to return it and it's not like that. We want sales that'll stick, and that's how it's going to be with these guys.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. I know it's early, but are you seeing new installers start to use NAPCO products? And are you getting inbounds or developing relationships with new installers as a result of the new distributor agreement?\nRichard Soloway: We're seeing new larger customers due to this arrangement, because certain large customers use this distributor as their main distributor. So, with introductions and the fact that the products are superior to what's on the marketplace is great for us. These new customers have said, \"Wow, I didn't realize the functionality we get and the ease of installation we get for our crews that are out in the field.\" And once they see this, they become adopters of the product. So, it's a great relationship because there are certain dealers that want to use this particular distributor that only uses distributor. So, that opens those doors in a big way.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Appreciate it.\nKevin Buchel: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Raj Sharma from B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nRaj Sharma: Yeah, thank you. Congratulations on the nice quarter, guys. My question is on the growth rate for the next few quarters or the next few years. Alarm and intrusion this quarter is about flat and locking was up 10%. Should we expect -- what kind of growth rate should we expect for the next few quarters? In-line or ramping up?\nKevin Buchel: Alarm was actually up this quarter. It wasn't flat, it was up by about 5%, actually. So, we expect all in, we want to be 10% or greater. And this 6% that we were up for this quarter was very encouraging as we get back to a 10% or greater growth rate for hardware. In order to do that, we need all the players to be a part of it. That means the intrusion side, the locking, and the access. The locking has been doing great, two companies, Alarm Lock and Marks, both firing on all cylinders. NAPCO was hurt by the radio decline, came back up 5% this quarter. We expect more, more because of Prima, more because of the new distributor, and more because radio sales will come back. So, as we go forward, 10% or greater is what we're looking for.\nRaj Sharma: Great. And the locking is the similar sort of a growth rate or higher?\nKevin Buchel: Locking has been higher, being conservative, modestly, 10%. But they can do a lot more and have been.\nRaj Sharma: Right. And next question is recurring revenues. The retention rates must be pretty high. Is there any sort of number on the retention rate or the number of devices that are live?\nKevin Buchel: The retention rate is very high. Churn is a big word that's used when you're in the residential space. We're mostly commercial. Churn is insignificant. Now, when we have Prima being a bigger part of our sales, there may be a churn rate. It's residential. Residential people change their minds. They decide they want a system, then they don't. We'll look at that when we get to that point. But for right now, where we are, churn is inconsequential. And there's roughly 750,000 radios that are generating the run rate of $76.5 million. So, to get to our $150 million goal by 2026, the way we look at it, essentially, we got to add another 750,000 radios. And that's not a lot when you consider the millions and millions of opportunities that are out there. We're not saying we have to get every one of them. We'd love it. We've got to get our fair share. 750,000 out of the millions is not even a high percentage. So that's what gives us confidence about hitting the goal.\nRaj Sharma: Got it. And the growth in the recurring revenues, which products are contributing the most, which are contributing the least? Any sort of color on that?\nKevin Buchel: The Fire radios are the biggest contributor. That's why you're seeing the gross margin of 90%. Fire radios gets the most on a monthly basis compared to the others. The others are great, too. Fire leads to 90%. The others, maybe they lead to 80%, 82%, 83%. Not so bad. All good. But Fire is number one.\nRaj Sharma: Got it. And then, the sell-through -- last question for me. Sell-through at dealers, you said, is picking up. And I know because of the excess inventory issue for a couple of dealers, it was lagging the year-on-year. Overall, is it up 5% sell-through you think at dealers or up 10% now?\nKevin Buchel: I'd have to look at that, Raj. What I do know is it was much more in Q2 than Q1, but I'll have to look to see where are we year to date. Probably up, given what I saw in Q2.\nRaj Sharma: Overall, it's up faster than what your quarterly year-on-year is exhibiting. Would that be fair to say?\nKevin Buchel: I think it's fair to say that it's up compared to what we expected. It's happening faster. And on locking, it's very good. And on intrusion, definitely up sequentially. Versus a year ago, I'd have to look.\nRaj Sharma: Got it. That's it for me. Thank you for answering my questions again.\nKevin Buchel: Thank you, Raj.\nRaj Sharma: Congratulations on a good quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the CEO, Richard Soloway, for closing remarks.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's conference call. As always, should you have any further questions, please feel free to call Fran, Kevin, or myself for further information. We thank you for your interest and support, and we look forward to speaking to you all again in a few months to discuss NAPCO's fiscal Q3 results. Have a great day, everybody. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."

With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Richard Soloway, President and Chief Executive Officer of Napco Security Technologies. Dick, the floor is yours.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you, Fran. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our results. We are pleased to report our fiscal Q1 2024 record sales of $41.7 million. This is the 12th consecutive quarter we achieved record sales for a quarterly reporting period. Recurring revenue service continues to grow at a very strong rate and the annual prospective run rate is now $72.5 million based on October 2023 recurring revenues. Our balance sheet remains strong with our cash balances at $74.6 million, up 68% over fiscal Q1 2023 and up 12% sequentially. We have no debt. We continue to focus on capitalizing on key industry trends, which include wireless fire and intrusion alarms and the related recurring revenue service school security solutions, plus enterprise access control systems and architectural locking products. The management team here at Napco continues to focus on the key metrics of growth, profits and returns on equity and controlling our costs. These metrics are important to us as well as our shareholders. We continue to execute our business strategy, and our interests are aligned with our shareholders as senior management of Napco owns approximately 10% of the equity. Before I go into greater detail, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevin Buchel. He will provide an overview of our fiscal first quarter results, and then I’ll be back with more on our strategies and view of our markets. Kevin?\nKevin Buchel: Thank you, Dick and good morning everybody. Net sales for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, increased by 6% to a fiscal first quarter record of $41.7 million as compared to $39.5 million for the same period last year. Recurring monthly service revenue continued its strong growth, increasing 25% in Q1 to $17.3 million compared to $13.8 million for the same period last year. Our recurring service revenues now have a prospective annual run rate of approximately $72.5 million based on October 2023 recurring service revenues, and that compares to $67 million based on July 2023 recurring service revenues which we reported back in August. Equipment sales for the quarter decreased 5% to $24.4 million as compared to $25.7 million last year. This decrease was primarily due to the expected softness in radio sales as some distributors work off excess inventory, which was the result of distributors loading up with radios when the impending 3G Verizon sunset was approaching and they wanted to ensure that they had updated 5G radios in their inventory. And this was partially offset by increases in both our Alarm Lock and our Marks store locking products, which increased 24% in Q1 versus last year’s Q1. We believe the excess radio inventory in the channel is a temporary situation, and we expect radio sales to continue to be a key contributor to our hardware sales and lead to the continued growth of our highly profitable recurring revenue. Gross profit for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, increased 54% to $22.4 million with a gross margin of 54%, and that compares to $14.6 million with a gross margin of 37% for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for equipment sales for Q1 increased 188% to $6.9 million with a gross margin of 28% and that compares to $2.4 million with a gross margin of 9% last year. Gross profit for recurring revenues for the first quarter increased 28% to $15.6 million with a 90% gross margin, and that compares to $12.2 million with a gross margin of 88% and for the same period last year. The increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin for equipment sales was primarily the result of more normalized material and freight costs after the cessation of the global supply chain problems as well as the shift in product mix to higher-margin locking products. The 200 basis point increase in gross margin on service revenues now 90% was primarily due to the continued increase in service revenues relating to the company’s fire radios, which have higher monthly selling prices than the company’s intrusion radios. Research and development costs for the quarter remained relatively constant at $2.4 million or 6% of sales for both Q1 this year as well as Q1 last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were also relatively constant at $8.4 million or 20% of net sales as compared to $8.5 million or 22% of net sales last year. Operating income for the quarter increased 222% to $11.6 million as compared to $3.6 million for the same period last year. The company’s provision for income taxes for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, increased by approximately $1.1 million to $1.5 million with an effective tax rate of 13% as compared to $461,000 with an effective tax rate of 13% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the 3 months was primarily due to higher taxable income. Net income for the quarter increased 239% to a Q1 record $10.5 million or $0.28 per diluted share as compared to $3.1 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the same period last year, and it represents 25% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 174% to a Q1 record $12.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share, and that compares to $4.7 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period last year and equates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 31%. Moving on to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2023, the company had $74.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and that compared to $66.7 million at June 30, 2023, and that represents a 12% increase. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $115.9 million at September 30, 2023, and that compares with working capital of $111.7 million at June 30, 2023. And the current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities with 6.3:1 at September 30, 2023, and was 6.7:1 at June 30, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, was $11.2 million, and that compared to cash used in operating activities of $2 million for the same period last year. CapEx for the quarter was $256,000 and that compared to $372,000 in the prior period last year. This concludes my formal remarks, and I would now like to return the call back to Dick.\nRichard Soloway: Kevin, thank you. As I mentioned, our fiscal 2024 is off to a great start with fiscal Q1 results, achieving record profits driven by hardware enabled recurring revenue growth of 25%, representing 41% of total company revenues. Total company revenues were up 6% year-over-year and we achieved gross profit growth of 54% to $22.4 million. While our equipment revenue declined by 5%, gross margins on such sales increased to 28%, and our recurring revenue grew by 25% to $17.3 million with an annual run rate of $72.5 million as of October 2023. And our locking sales from our Alarm Lock and Marks divisions, which represents 62% of our hardware sales, increased 24% in Q1 versus last year’s Q1. As we work through channel inventory, we expect equipment revenues to reaccelerate as thousands of 3G radios need to be replaced and we anticipate these will be replaced with Napco’s newer generation radios because alarm dealers must have new functioning and recurring revenue-producing radios to monitor alarm conditions. This would result in both additional hardware revenue and increasing recurring revenue for the company. We continue to focus on our previously stated goals of $150 million run rate in recurring revenue and $150 million of equipment revenue on or about the end of fiscal 2026. Achieving these goals as well as our gross margin goals of 80% for recurring revenue, and it was 90% here in Q1 and a 50% goal for equipment would generate EBITDA margins in excess of 45%. We are well on our way to achieving this goal as our EBITDA margin in Q1 was 31%. There are thousands of commercial buildings of all types such as offices, hospitals, schools, coffee shops, restaurants, and others that still require upgrades from legacy copper phone lines. Our StarLink line of radios have the widest coverage range of both AT&T and Verizon with rich feature sets, which our dealers love. Margins for recurring revenue improved by 200 basis points to 90% this quarter versus 88% in the same period a year ago. As we have previously stated, the constraints of the supply chain are abating, and we believe in the coming months that combined with new distribution services we have developed, we will begin to reinvigorate our equipment sales to even higher levels than any time before. When that happens, we also expect to generate increased hardware gross margins as the higher the level of hardware sales, the more overhead absorption occurs in our Dominican Republic factory and this expands our gross margins. We also announced the hiring of Deloitte & Touche as our new accounting firm. Deloitte has one of the largest professional service networks in the world and is known for their renowned reputation expertise and having a strong track record of providing high-quality audit and advisory services to a wide range of clients. At this stage, for Napco, it’s essential to choose a big four firm with industry-specific experience that aligns with our organization and who understands the unique challenges and regulations relevant to our sector. An additional highlight in this quarter was the partnering with one of the largest alarm product distributors in the U.S.A. with over 100 branches across the country to service alarm dealers, system integrators and locking professionals and with this new relationship, our distribution network expands to over 300 locations. Our R&D team remains hard at work, developing more products for the future, which will help us grow our recurring revenue business. In October 2023, we introduced a new high-volume small business residential burglar fire alarm called Prima, which could generate substantial growth in hardware sales and profits and most importantly, add substantial recurring revenue service to Napco. Also in the quarter, we have made some strategic investments and personnel adding to the existing talent of our team. These additions in engineering and specialized sales will help us continue to develop more new and exciting products faster and take them to market in new ways so as to get our alarm locking and integrators excited. Lastly, as indicated in the earnings release, we will be issuing another $0.08 per share dividend and we are proud of this program as the Napco team has created such tremendous shareholder value over the years, and this is another way for us to distribute profitable growth to investors. We are off to a great start for fiscal 2024, and we have a pristine balance sheet, no debt and continue to generate strong sales and healthy profits. We believe we can continue this growth well into the future as we work toward our fiscal 2026 goals and beyond. I’d like to thank everyone for their support and for joining us in this exciting future we have. Our formal remarks are now concluded and we would like to open the call for the Q&A session. Ross, please proceed.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Pfau from William Blair. Please go ahead, Matt.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and nice results. I wanted to just first ask on the accounting restatements that you had. It looked like you’ve changed the auditor to help address that. Anything else you’re doing internally to help address some of those past issues? And how should we think about those impacting your expenses? Thanks.\nKevin Buchel: Thanks, Matt. So we’ve done a few things. One, our procedures at the end of the quarter is different than it was in the past. We performed price testing on any large items that are in the raw materials. We compare it to what we had. If there is any changes, we adjust it. We do the same thing in October on a test basis and we continue to investigate any changes that might have occurred. We didn’t see hardly any changes in this past quarter. We didn’t expect to see any changes of the supply chain crisis, the chaos that it brought with it is over. And that’s really what caused these changes in pricing in the last year. But we still check it, and we are investing in a module that will do a lot of this quicker and in a more automated fashion, and we expect that to be live by Q3. We are also – we hired a consulting firm to work with us to get our procedures and policies and internal controls to be perfect, so that we don’t have any weaknesses or no deficiencies. They will be working hand in hand with Deloitte. Deloitte will start right after we file our Q1 which will be in the next day or 2. Once that Q is filed, Deloitte becomes our new accountants. They will work hand-in-hand with the consultant. We plan on hiring an internal control auditor on our staff. We plan on hiring to industrial engineers to focus on the material and the labor costings. Each of these things is in motion. We haven’t felt the impact of any of them yet because this is all happening now. So over the next 12 months, we will start to see the expense impact of this – my guess is it will cost up to $1 million over the course of the year. So if you measure us from October through the following September, it will probably be $1 million more than what we’ve seen – up to $1 million. All well worth it, and we’re looking forward to working closely with both Deloitte and our consulting firm.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. That’s helpful. And wanted to follow-up on the equipment revenue results. So it sounds like there was some continued weakness in radio sales, but strength in other areas to help offset that. Can you give us an idea of the revenue and performance by segment there so we can better understand what’s going on in the equipment business. Thanks.\nKevin Buchel: Right. You’ll see this in the Q when it gets filed either later today or in the next couple of days. I’m not sure exactly when it’s going to be, but it will be soon. There is a table that’s in footnote two, and it shows the breakout between intrusion and access alarm products, door locking devices and recurring revenue. So in this quarter that we just completed, the intrusion and access alarm was $9.3 million. Door locking products was $15.1 million and the recurring which you can also see on the income statement was $17.3 million. The intrusion part was down. We expected it to be down. Last year, a year ago at this time, we were in what I call radio mania, where everybody was loading up trying to get their hands on as many radios as they could, given the impending 3G sunset, which was occurring January of 2023, which did happen. A lot of dealers are last-minute guys, but they were scrambling around to load up, and there wasn’t a lot of choices either. A lot of our competitors were having trouble delivering. You remember going back a year ago, there was – we were in the midst of supply chain issues. Nobody could get their hands on the micros that are required in these radios. We were able to get our hands on it and we spent the money to get our hands on it. We spent extra money buying these chips from brokers, we did whatever we could to keep things moving. Because we knew how, a, how important it was to get radios in the hands of all the dealers. But also, we know that it leads to recurring revenue. And we – as we’ve talked about before, picked up some new large accounts because we were able to deliver and others couldn’t. And some distributors just bought up whatever they can get their hands on. So not a surprise – now that inventory has to be worked off now that the sunset has come and gone. And we were encouraged. We saw that the sell-through stats for Q1 were better than they were in Q4. We knew they were going to be less than they were a year ago, not a surprise, but we worked very closely with our distributors to help them move this equipment through opening up also a brand new large distributor with over 100 locations is going to help move overall radio inventory that we expect to happen. We’ve seen signs of that already. So that’s encouraging. And from a locking point of view, locking we have two companies Alarm Lock and Marks. They have both been doing great for several quarters in a row. It’s attributable to infrastructure upgrades at airports, it’s attributable to school security, a bunch of school jobs that we’re getting can’t announce it. A lot of times the schools don’t let us, but we see it, we hear about it. We know about it. Hospitals buildings that want to go to a more upgradable locking setup where you don’t have to use a key big projects with hotels. It’s happening all over. We’re very encouraged by the strength of the locking business and of course, the locking margins are better than, say, the radio margins. But radio margins might be 20%. Of course, it leads to the recurring. Locking margins mid-30s to over 40. So that helped the overall gross margin for the quarter.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Appreciate the additional detail, and you taking my questions. Thanks.\nKevin Buchel: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Please go ahead, Jim.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, thank you. I wanted to get a little bit more color, if we could, on the new distribution source that you’re talking about. It sounds like this has the potential to be another important channel for you guys. I wonder if you could elaborate on how quickly that might scale?\nRichard Soloway: The new distribution source is another distributor, which is the largest in the industry. And it came to us the last ISC show in Las Vegas and said, we would like to be able to market your products. We have a great network throughout the U.S.A. They have 115 branches and train our guys and we will be a great customer for you. They have a lot of customers there that are new that we don’t have. We have approximately 12,000 dealers all independent business people that run alarm companies and system integration companies. So this new distributor has additional companies that they are going to bring to us to sell our products. We’re very, very unique, the most unique company in the security industry because we manufacture fire alarms, burglar alarms, locking products and access products. There is no one manufacturer that has all those segments. So we have a great ability with our sales group to explain to these new customers how we have an integrated solution, and we expect it to add a lot of additional volume to our business. So now we have about 300 branches between our independent network, which are fabulous guys that have a great customer base. And this new network, there is going to be lots of Napco company products out there and a lot of our salesmen, as we said, we’ve added additional salespeople to help sell it and to break in these distributors as to what we make and why it’s – so it has such great advantages over anything on the marketplace. So we’re looking for an exciting future with our new distributor.\nJim Ricchiuti: What kind of traction are you seeing? I know it’s early days with Prima, I’m wondering if you can give us a sense as to how you see that potentially ramping as you go through the year? And I assume the margin profile of this is a little bit lower in terms of – as we think about recurring revenue and I wonder if you could also talk to whether there might be some cannibalization of your – perhaps some of your higher-priced offerings.\nRichard Soloway: The new Prima is completely different than anything else we have in our line. We’ve been making products called Gemini. The dealers love it. It’s rock solid. It’s fire alarms, it’s burglar alarms. And now Prima is a different type of product. It’s a product designed for smaller enterprises, it’s totally wireless, it can go either a small business or residential. It installs in, we like to say 5 minutes because it’s a lick-and-stick type of product, but it’s very, very reliable, has Napco quality to it. Napco feature sets in it. So, you have a 9-inch keypad that could be put in the front door of a store or a home and has additional satellite keypads, has motion detectors, it has electronic doorbell cameras and it has very, very unique features, which make it easy for the dealer that’s selling the job to actually install it right after the job is sold or we can leave it to the customer and the customer can install himself if he is handy – handy type of customer. It reports to any central station, the dealer is comfortable with that he has been using for his regular Gemini line of equipment. And we get recurring revenue for everyone because it’s all added to our NOC. It’s enrolled in our NOC, and we get a service fee like we do for any of our products. And the dealer also charges the end-user customer whatever the market will bear for the type of system, the dealer leaves behind. So, it’s a win-win for dealers, and it’s a win-win for us. The volume we expect from this is going to be a very, very high volume because there is lots of stores, lots of resonances that need this type of product. And it’s very, very good for the dealer to utilize this product because this product also eliminates a technical features in it that nothing else in the market has and eliminates truck rolls by the dealer for repairing and adjusting the system because it’s all self-adjusting. If somebody has a WiFi issue, somebody disconnects the WiFi in a resident, like kids like to play with the WiFi, the network. Currently, the dealers have to go back to that site and reboot and realign all the equipment. With Prima, it’s all automatic. It refines the network and reboots itself on many, many different levels. So, the dealer won’t have to go back and roll a truck. So, that’s a great boom for the dealer. Not only does it have all the fancy features and installs quickly, but also we call self-healing if the system is interrupted with people that are changing the WiFi or adjusting the WiFi system. So, it has a lot of features to it. So, we expect a lot of great things out of it. We started shipping it last month. Typically, it takes nine months to a year for a product really grip and get volume. This works very similar to Gemini and other products in the marketplace. So, I think the learning curve is going to be quicker.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thank you. And you guys are running into some tougher comps now as we think about the door lock device business. And I wonder what’s your line of sight into that business as you look out over the next….?\nRichard Soloway: The locking business is a strong business for us and it has a lot of tech – our products have a lot of tech. When the business was started, I wanted the business to be very technical. And we acquired two companies, which basically made mechanical things, locks, traditional type mechanical locks like everybody else in the business. But our idea was to add technology to it and radios to it. So, it transfers over distance. It’s cell phone communications to the locks. It’s so many different things that locks that have made locks modern. So, while we still make traditional hardware mechanical locks, we also make a whole line of electronic-oriented which use near-field Z-Wave, cellular because now we are getting locks, we are making locks for the dealers that never got recurring revenue before, a whole line of locks where it’s installed by the dealer, but they get recurring revenue from the customer and for themselves, never been done before in this business. So, that’s where it is. We bring a lot of technology to the mechanical locking business, and it’s really paying off, and we expect it to continue to pay off in the future.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And final question, I will jump back in the queue. Kevin, any sense as to where we are in terms of the higher price components that you had in inventory in terms of where we are and burning that off?\nKevin Buchel: We are not buying anything now at the higher pricing. Those days are over. We have to work through some radio inventory because like some of the distributors, we have some extra radio inventory as well. The mixed bag, some of it was priced at higher component costs, some of it at normal component costs. So, that’s why for this past quarter, you saw a gross margin of 28% on hardware, which was great compared to kind of what it’s been. It’s going to get better as the year progresses for two reasons. One, we are going to not have hardly any of the high radio costs in inventory anymore as we go through it. And of course, as the volume picks up and our volumes get stronger as the year progresses, typically, Q2 being better than Q1, Q3 being better than Q2, Q4 being better than Q3 on the hardware side to get that overhead absorption, the margins expand. So, I am a conservative guy. I was happy to see 28% as we move into the balance of fiscal 2024. My expectation is that these margins will continue to expand even further.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jaeson Schmidt from Lake Street Capital. Please go ahead, Jaeson.\nJaeson Schmidt: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious if you could provide some color on what you saw from distributor sell-through in the September quarter? And then relatedly, Obviously, you continue to kind of go through this inventory digestion period. When do you think that period is over? Is it largely going to be over in this current quarter?\nKevin Buchel: We have said give it a couple of quarters to work so that the distributors could work through the inventory. This was the first of the two. So, I think we have another quarter to work it through. We are working through the – we are working with our distributors to help them lower their inventory levels on the radios, having this new distributor helps a lot. It’s going to help the stats a lot. They are going to move it, I think at much better paces than the couple of guys that have excess. We were encouraged in the sell-through stats while the sell-through stats on the intrusion guys showed it was lower, our stats were lower than they were a year ago, which we expected because of the radios. We did see it was better than Q4. So, sequentially it was up. That to me shows starting to move in the right direction. And so we are very encouraged by that. But I would give this – we said two quarters, we just saw one another quarter and we think this second quarter of the two will be better than the one we just did. And then by Q3, for us, it’s more normalized. But whatever it’s going to take, we are going to work with the distributors to move it through. We have been through this before. This is no different. We will put in whatever effort it takes.\nJaeson Schmidt: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you guys are limited what you can announce in the school security market. But just curious if you could provide an update what you are seeing in that space.\nKevin Buchel: Yes. I wish we could announce more as I hear about. I don’t hear about everyone because sometimes the schools go direct to the distributors and the distributors just sell to the school, to school districts. But I do hear about some, and I am always begging to be able to announce it. And there is usually a reluctance, they don’t, they like to keep things off the radar. Some let us, some don’t. But the school business is still a key part of locking. It’s one of the reasons why the locking sales have grown that infrastructure upgrades in airports, upgrades in hospitals, etcetera, things I mentioned before, they are all key to the locking business, but schools is a part of it. And again, when we could announce it, we will. We are seeing that the schools are no longer waiting for the kids to be out of school. It used to be that this was somewhat of a seasonal thing. The kids are out of school for the winter break, that’s when the jobs would get done or the kids are out of school in the universities by May, and that’s when the jobs will get done. What’s happening now, we see it all year around schools can’t afford to wait, too much at stake, there is no real seasonality to it. And so we are working hard banging on the doors of all the school districts. There is lots of K-12s out there, and there is over 5,000 universities. And even though we have been talking about this for years, so many, many schools, most, I would say, still don’t have equipment that would prevent tragedies. So, we always said, they ask me what inning are we in, in the school segment, school security segment. And I say it’s still early innings despite all the things that have gone on.\nJaeson Schmidt: Okay. Appreciate that color. Thanks a lot guys.\nKevin Buchel: Thanks Jaeson.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Raj Sharma from B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead Raj.\nRaj Sharma: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the results. The locking device sales are so strong, and they continue to be – can you add some color on where that’s coming from? And should we expect that to continue for the next – the rest of the year?\nRichard Soloway: I see that the locking sales are across the board. Institutions, schools, high-rises, hospitals, airport upgrades, it’s everywhere. The Trilogy line, which is our original invention, which has been improved over the years, is the number one locking product, electronic locking product in the business. As I happen to live in Manhattan, I go to LaGuardia Airport upgraded with Trilogies, Kennedy airport, Trilogies. NYU Hospital, Trilogies. department stores, Trilogies. It’s a very, very key product for security in all kinds of buildings. So, we would expect this to continue. We also make it in different versions. We make remote control wireless Trilogies that generate recurring revenue. We make standalone trilogies. We make trilogies for schools. So, we have a very, very wide range of applications for this lock. And we expect the locking business to keep on growing and getting stronger as we add new models to Trilogy and that’s how we see it.\nRaj Sharma: Great. Thank you. And then the alarm sales slowdown, we are hearing that, that should reverse in a quarter or two quarters, so this slowdown is due to dealer inventories, not due to end market demand. Is that the correct way to understand that?\nRichard Soloway: Very much so, Raj. That’s how we see it. Look at, there is a couple of stats that I pointed out in our prepared remarks, one of which was the run rate. The run rate, we are used to the run rate growing is to grow by about $1 million a month or would be up $3 million for a quarter.\nRaj Sharma: That’s a recurring revenue...\nRichard Soloway: Recurring revenue run rate. And what we saw last quarter, it went from $63 million to $67 million, it went up by $4 million. That was very encouraging, more than $1 million per month. This quarter, it went from $67 million to $72.5 million, almost $73 million, not quite there, $72.5 million, that’s almost a $2 million a month increase. That run rate is telling you that there is a lot of radios being activated and those radios that are being activated, we are getting paid on them. And those are very good signs. So, that’s why we believe that, that plus our activation stats, that’s why we believe the slowdown that we keep talking about is more of an inventory and distribution issue as opposed to a demand issue.\nRaj Sharma: Great. So, this alarm slowdown then shouldn’t impact the recurring revenues down, a few quarters down, they should pick it up as you see a pickup in alarm sales?\nKevin Buchel: That’s what we believe. And remember, the higher the number goes, and it’s, recurring is 41% of overall sales. Remember, when you have been with us long enough to remember it was a very small percent, now it’s 41%. The higher that number goes, the harder it is to keep that increased percentage up to simple math. But we have managed to do a good job keeping it up, but we are also introducing new stuff, new products like Prima to give us more recurring so that we can keep the pace up as we go forward and head to our 2026 goal. In the 2026 goal, we didn’t even include prima. So, we are giving ourselves extra ways to get there, Prima being one of them. And also in our 2026 goal, we used 80% gross margin on the recurring and we were at 90% this quarter. So, these are the things to keep in mind as we head towards that 2026 timeframe.\nRaj Sharma: Got it. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I will take it offline. Thank you and congratulations again.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you, Raj. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, there appears to be no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Soloway for closing remarks.\nRichard Soloway: Thank you everyone for participating in today’s conference call. As always, should you have any further questions, feel free to call Fran, Kevin or myself for further information. We thank you for your interest and support, and we look forward to speaking to you all again in a few months to discuss Napco’s fiscal Q2 results. Bye-bye and have a wonderful day.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for attending."
