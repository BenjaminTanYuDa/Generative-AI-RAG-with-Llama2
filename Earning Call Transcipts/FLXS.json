[Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Ressler, Chief Financial Officer for Flexsteel Industries. Please go ahead.\nMike Ressler: Thank you, and welcome to today’s call to discuss Flexsteel Industries’ second quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results. Our earnings release, which we issued after market close yesterday, February 5 is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.flexsteelindustries.com, under News and Events. I am here today with Jerry Dittmer, Chief Executive Officer; and Derek Schmidt, President. On today’s call, we will provide prepared remarks, and then we will open the call to your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments on today’s call will include forward-looking statements, which can be identified using words such as estimate, anticipate, expect and similar phrases. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those that are described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as updated by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings as applicable. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this conference call and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The press release available on the website contains the financial and other quantitative information to be discussed today as well as the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Dittmer. Jerry?\nJerry Dittmer: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I’d like to start by welcoming Mike Ressler, our new Chief Financial Officer. Mike has been with Flexsteel over 17 years in various accounting, finance and other cross functional roles, most recently as the Vice President of Manufacturing. His appointment as CFO reflects his leadership and contribution to the company’s transformation over the past several years. And I’m excited for Mike to further expand his positive impact on the company as CFO. I would also like to congratulate Derek Schmidt on his appointment to President and to the Board of Directors. Derek’s promotion reflects his leadership of the company’s operations and growth strategy and aligns with his expanded responsibilities since joining the company nearly four years ago. With that, I am very pleased to share with you our second quarter fiscal year 2024 results. While headwinds from macroeconomic challenges and shifts in consumer spending towards experiences and away from things persist in our industry, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and delivered sales growth of 7.5% when compared to the prior year quarter. In addition, our relentless focus on operational efficiency and cost savings propelled gross margin expansion and helped fund additional investment in growth initiatives while delivering significantly improved operating income when compared to both the same quarter of the prior year and our first quarter fiscal 2024. While we expect the business environment in the near term to remain challenged, our team isn’t deterred and remains intensely focused on continuing to profitably grow our business throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and long term. We will continue our positive momentum going into the third quarter and are confident in our ability to grow sales, both compared to last year and the second quarter. I’ll now turn the call over to Derek to discuss our results and an update on our growth initiative. I’ll be back at the end of the call with some closing comments on what we see ahead.\nDerek Schmidt: Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Like Jerry, I am very pleased with our second quarter results. We are competing well in our core business and executing our market expansion initiatives, resulting in both sales and profit growth even in a difficult business environment. As Jerry noted earlier, we grew our top line by 7.5% in the fiscal second quarter. This year-over-year sales comparison continues to be adversely impacted by the elimination of ocean freight surcharges which reduced revenue by approximately $3.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. As discussed in our first quarter call, in the prior year, we used this surcharge mechanism to pass through higher cost of ocean container delivery which were significantly inflated due to supply chain issues. Container delivery costs normalized throughout the last fiscal year and we subsequently eliminated this surcharge. Excluding the $3.5 million impact from this ocean freight surcharge elimination, sales growth related to unit volume and product mix was a robust 11.7%, further reinforcing our strong sales execution. Despite challenging industry conditions, we remain confident in our ability to continue our growth momentum into the second half of fiscal 2024 from both continued share gains in our core business and increasing momentum in our market expansion initiatives. In our core business, we expect to continue outperforming the industry by continuously improving and providing a differentiated customer experience, aligning ourselves with the strongest, most capable distribution partners, and driving a constant stream of relevant and compelling new product. We define our core business based upon where the majority of our current sales are derived from, which is product designed for primary living spaces like the living room, which are sold through independent furniture retailers and have a more traditional or transitional style that primarily appeals to Gen X and Baby Boomers consumers. This core business is large and profitable and we will continue to defend and expand our penetration in this market. At the same time, we are pursuing growth in markets outside of our core that we believe are relevant and growing, and where we have a clear right to win. If you recall from prior calls, these market expansion initiatives take three forms. First, consumer segments, namely Gen Z and Millennials. Second, product categories outside of primary living spaces, and lastly sales distribution outside of independent furniture retailers. I’m pleased with our solid progress in all three of these areas. First, to address younger consumers, we’re repositioning our brand portfolio through a three pronged approach. We are modernizing the Flexsteel brand and last October we launched a strong lineup of more contemporary product at lower price points with exceptional comfort and quality. We’re encouraged by initial placements, and sales of these new products are ramping nicely. We also launched a new brand, Charisma, last year to reach younger consumers with even lower price on-trend product. And this year we’ve invested in new talent and product engineering to support Charisma and we’ll be launching multiple exciting new products at April’s High Point market to grow this new brand. Additionally, we continue expanding our new flex solution with broader accessories to further improve its modularity and appeal to younger consumers. Moving on to our second market expansion focus, which is to expand into newer product categories. We focused on health and wellness this year with our new Zecliner sleep chair. A recent third-party sleep study validated the superior sleep results from using Zecliner, which we are now leveraging in our marketing and demand generation initiatives. The product is now placed in over 960 retailers and we are investing aggressively in additional innovation to protect our leadership position in this emerging market. Our third market expansion focus is to broaden our sales distribution to position our brands, where and how consumers want to purchase furniture, both now and into the future. For example, our Flex Modular Solution, which I mentioned earlier, can be purchased not only in leading retailers, but also on Amazon, Wayfair, costco.com and our own online platform at flexsteelstore.com. While I'm excited about our top line growth and future growth prospects, I'm equally energized by our improved profitability, which is being propelled by four drivers. First, new products with higher margin profiles. We've raised the threshold for new product margins and expect product life cycle management will continue to improve our gross margin over time. Second, we're executing well operationally and delivering strong cost savings within our supply chain. Third, we've remained disciplined with pricing and pull back promotions were needed to improve overall profitability. And fourth, we are achieving leverage on fixed costs through higher sales volume, which we believe will continue to be an important driver of operating margin improvement going forward as we grow the business. As I noted earlier, differentiated customer experience is an important element of share gains in our core markets. As part of our ongoing commitment to improve the customer experience, the company announced the closure of our Dublin, Georgia manufacturing plant. While this decision was very difficult, it enables us to reduce customer lead times and handling damage to improve the overall customer experience, while also decreasing inventory, simplifying logistics execution and improving profitability. Currently, the Dublin facility supports less than 5% of the company's sales, and we expect to retain virtually all sales through this transition. Closure of the facility is expected to occur by the end of our fiscal fourth quarter. As part of this transition, the company expects to incur pretax restructuring and related expenses between $2.5 million and $3.2 million. The one-time costs are associated with employee separations inventory and equipment transfers and other expenses directly related to the closure and are expected to be incurred primarily in our third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2024. Once the closure is fully executed, the company expects annualized savings in the range of $4 million to $4.5 million. The Dublin facility will be listed for sale upon closure, and the company anticipates a future one-time gain in excess of the carrying value of the asset. To summarize, we are growing and gaining share under challenging industry conditions. We have robust plans to continue that growth both through our core markets and expansion into new markets. We are rapidly improving profitability with more gains expected through fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025. We are generating strong free cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet, and we are investing to continuously improve our customer experience and to drive new innovation that will differentiate us and strengthen our market leadership long-term. Future is bright and I'm excited about what lies ahead for our organization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will give you some additional details on the financial performance for the second quarter and the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nMike Ressler: Thanks Derek. For the quarter, net sales were $100.1 million, slightly above our guidance of $94 million to $100 million, provided during our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. As Derek noted earlier sales growth related to unit, volume and mix, which when excluding prior year quarter ocean freight surcharges was a strong 11.7% in the quarter. And we feel we have sustainable growth momentum throughout the rest of fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025. From a profit perspective, the company delivered operating income of $4.6 million or 4.6% of sales in the second quarter, which exceeded our operating guidance range of 2% to 4%. A meaningful increase in our operating income was driven by an expansion of our gross margin to 21.9% in the quarter compared to 17% in the prior year quarter. Moving to the balance sheet and statement of cash flows. The company ended the quarter with $3.3 million in cash, working capital of $100.5 million and a balance on our revolving line of credit of $17.9 million. Our increased profit, combined with improved working capital levels, allowed us to pay down our debt by 46%, when compared to the fiscal first quarter. Looking forward, we reiterate the sales guidance release with our preliminary results announcement on January 11, 2024. And while we expect one-time costs related to the closure of our Dublin facility, will adversely impact GAAP operating income, we still expect to achieve our fiscal 2024 operating income guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, when backing out the one-time costs associated with the facility closure. Specifically, for the fiscal third quarter we expect sales between $101 million and $106 million, which represents sales growth of 2% to 7%. Regarding profitability, we expect gross margin in the range of 21% to 22%. We expect gross margin to grow modestly throughout the remainder of the fiscal year and into fiscal 2025, driven by sales growth and continued realization of our cost savings initiatives. We will continue to prudently manage SG&A spending with a focus on investing in our growth initiatives and expect SG&A costs between $17 million and $17.5 million for the third quarter. Due to one-time costs related to the closure of our Dublin facility, we expect to incur restructuring costs in the third quarter between $2.0 million and $2.5 million, primarily related to employee separation costs in the transfer of equipment and materials to other facilities. We are projecting GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% for the third quarter. Excluding one-time charges related to the closure of our Dublin facility, we expect adjusted non-GAAP operating income of 4.5% to 5.5%, consistent with our previously disclosed guidance. The most significant driver of variability in our forecasted guidance ranges, our consumer demand changes, increases to ocean container rates resulting from the disruption in the Red Sea and competitive pricing conditions, all of which will be largely influenced by external factors. Regarding our cash flow outlook in the second half of fiscal 2024, we expect improved profit and further inventory reduction to be a meaningful source of cash. Near-term priorities for cash remain reducing debt, resourcing new innovation and funding modest capital expenditures, mainly related to cost savings initiatives and continued modernization of our IT systems. For the third quarter, we expect capital expenditures to be between $1.0 million and $1.5 million. We expect debt levels at the end of the third quarter to be in the range of $12 million to $17 million. And by the end of fiscal 2024, we expect debt levels in the range of zero to $10 million. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be in the range of 30% to 32%. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry to share his perspectives on our outlook.\nJerry Dittmer: Thanks Mike. While we remain cognizant of macroeconomic factors, which could impact our current outlook, I am optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share and confident we can maintain our profitable growth trajectory both in the near and long-term. We have great momentum and are well positioned to successfully deliver improved earnings and an even stronger balance sheet over the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and into fiscal year 2025. With that, we will open the call to your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Anthony Lebiedzinski with Sidoti & Company, LLC. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Yes. Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So first, a nice job in a tough environment for sure. So you guys talked about – a lot about the market share gains in your core business. Just broadly speaking, is it – are you doing more business with your existing clients? Or are you signing up new accounts? I mean just wanted to get a better sense as to where those share gains are coming from?\nJerry Dittmer: Yes, Anthony, thanks for the question. This is Jerry. Yes, a lot of our growth is in our core strategic accounts and in our core business. Obviously, we're still out signing up new folks at all times, but most of it has come from us going deeper and getting more placements with our core accounts.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: That's very helpful. So the unit volume increase certainly is even more impressive than your total sales gains. So I guess in terms of your guidance going forward, how should we think about the split between unit volumes versus pricing?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. I think, Anthony, its Derek. Going forward, so in the third quarter, as we – let's break pricing out between the surcharge impact and then just kind of normal pricing. So in the third quarter, there's about $2 million of impact of the ocean freight surcharge elimination, and then that comparison goes away in the fourth quarter. What we are assuming in terms of pricing is status quo, likely for the remainder of the calendar year. The only caveat to that is as you're likely aware, ocean freight container rates have gone up substantially. They've actually almost doubled since the beginning of December. So if they stay at that rate, we will have to consider certainly turning back on some types of surcharge mechanism. But all that aside, we would expect that the majority of the go-forward growth is related to the unit volume and mix and not pricing.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Understood. Yes, thanks Derek. Yes, and I was going to ask about the ocean freight costs, so those have gone up certainly from the bottom here. Okay. But at this point, you have not passed along any higher sort of charges because of the Red Sea conflict? So, okay, understood. All right. And then I guess I just wanted to dig in a little bit deeper in terms of the gross margin improvement, obviously a very strong year-over-year. Maybe if you could just kind of parse out maybe over the kind of the puts and takes as to what drove that; I know you talked about some cost savings initiatives. Obviously, you have fixed cost leverages there as well. So maybe if you could just go over some of the details behind the gross margin improvement and your confidence level about being able to sustain that?\nMike Ressler: Anthony, this is Mike. Yes. So I think as Derek highlighted, we have kind of four-key drivers of the gross margin improvement. One, cost savings, so we've taken some actions to reduce structural costs. In the prior year we took a distribution center off-line, which lowered our structural costs. In addition, on the cost savings side, we have pretty strong operations team that are executing save initiatives both in our sourcing, manufacturing and then also in our logistics and distribution network. We feel like those processes are sustainable here going forward. The second thing, Derek mentioned was introduction of new products and using product life cycle management to improve profit kind of on a go-forward basis. So we're leveraging our cost savings initiatives as well as kind of our value engineering activities to continue to bring out new products that have a better margin profile than the legacy products we have that we're discontinuing. And then kind of the third piece would be the volume leverage. As we're really thoughtful about reinvesting back into our structural costs, so that way we get to leverage on our sales growth initiatives. And then lastly, we've just been able to be more strategic around our promotional activities as it relates to moving – slower moving inventory and things like that.\nDerek Schmidt: The one thing I'll add, Anthony, is I think the magnitude of impact from those four levers will change over time. I think in the near-term as Mike alluded to, operationally we're executing really well. Lots of cost savings from that. And I think the pricing discipline has been a really big profit lever in the near-term. As we look at the quarters ahead and the years ahead, what are going to be the main drivers of gross margin improvement going forward are going to be the product life cycle management. So as we've explained, again, we've raised the hurdle rates on new product as that becomes a larger and larger amount of our portfolio that's going to raise the overall margin profile. And then I think the operating leverage from growth. So, so again, I think the mix of drivers will kind of evolve here over the coming quarters and coming years, but we still feel confident in terms of our ability to continue to expand margins.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Understood. Yes. Thank you for that. And then I guess so – as far as the Dublin, Georgia facility closure here, you mentioned that it's going to result in annualized cost savings of – at the bottom end of that is $4 million. But I noticed that you didn't change your guidance for fiscal 2025. Is this just function of you guys trying to be conservative? Or just wondering if you will be reinvesting those savings elsewhere? How should we think about that?\nMike Ressler: Anthony, this is Mike. So when we built our fiscal 2025 guidance ranges, we modeled out several different structural cost change scenarios, and we still feel good about what we put out there for our fiscal 2025 guidance range on both top line as well as from an operating income perspective.\nDerek Schmidt: We had several scenarios, even though we had not made a decision in terms of closing Dublin at the time we provided 2025 guidance. There was multiple options to drive manufacturing efficiency, which as Mike said, we built into that fiscal year 2025 guidance. I think we'll be in a better position here at the end of this fiscal year, early next to determine if there's potential additional savings beyond what we've estimated that would meaningfully change our fiscal year 2025 guidance.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Understood. Well, thank you very much and best of luck and I'll pass it on to others.\nJerry Dittmer: Thanks, Anthony.\nDerek Schmidt: Thanks, Anthony.\nOperator: The next question is from Budd Bugatch with Water Tower Research. Please go ahead.\nBudd Bugatch: Good morning, Jerry. Good morning, Derek. And congratulations to you Mike, and to you Derek as well. A couple of questions on the order book if I could. Can you talk a little bit about the quality of orders in terms of the product vitality, how much of that's new business? I know you said most of it's coming from existing strategic accounts, but I was curious as to what you're seeing in terms of new placements, increased penetration in those accounts and with new product versus old product?\nJerry Dittmer: Yes. So at the highest level, Budd, a lot of them are getting new placements on the floor. We do have, obviously, our flex and Zecliner products are doing very well, and those obviously are also driving a big piece of that.\nDerek Schmidt: The other color that I'll add, Budd, is that we actually measure internally what our sales, the percent of our overall sales from new products. And we measure new products over the last kind of three years, and that's close to 25%. So we feel good that we are driving relevant new product that's resonating with the market. And we would expect going forward that new product would make up at least 25% of our overall sales, if not more, going forward.\nBudd Bugatch: And Derek, that's pretty much a classic definition of product vitality there. So when you look at that on a weighted or a continuing moving average, how has that changed over the last 12 months to 18 months?\nDerek Schmidt: It's definitely increased. We've been more aggressive around launching new products and that trajectory will continue.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. So if you looked at it basically on – just on a one – instead of a one year basis instead of a three, it would be higher than 25%, would be that weighted – that moving average, is that the way to read that answer?\nDerek Schmidt: Well, it's difficult to compare one, I mean, one year versus three year because you've got a lot more product in the three year. But if you look at that three-year percentage, what it is today, and if you were to rewind and go back 12 months ago, it was lower than the 25%. So again – and we do expect going forward that number to increase throughout time.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay.\nDerek Schmidt: Does that help?\nBudd Bugatch: I think so. I always try to put numbers to things. I know you – the color is qualitative and the numbers are quantitative. And that's definitely a weakness of the analytical community, wanting to be more quantitative and wanting numbers. I'm also curious as to the change in the composition of costs and how to look at maybe something like a contribution margin going forward with taking Dublin out and the facilities left, what's the variable cost structure look like the MLO and D&T [ph] kind of components of cost on a normalized basis. And what does the fixed cost component look like?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. It doesn't change that meaningfully from what we've shared previously with you, Budd. If you look at the composition of the $4 million to $4.5 million savings from Dublin, a little less than $2 million of that is from structural cost reduction. The rest of it is efficiencies around variable costs.\nBudd Bugatch: So looking at the – I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, my memory is – I'm old and my memory is faulty. But I do believe you told us a couple of years ago that I think that the target gross margin was in the low 20s. We seem to be there. What's that look like going forward?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. From a gross margin perspective, certainly, we're striving, we're aspiring to 23% or more kind of in the mid -long term. And we've raised the…\nMike Ressler: There is mid long term have a…\nDerek Schmidt: Three to five years.\nMike Ressler: Three to five years.\nDerek Schmidt: Three to five years, yes, to get.\nBudd Bugatch: All right. And if I – do I read the guidance right, that for 2025, you're saying that you're going to have no debt? Is that the way to read that? I was trying to make sure I understood the table.\nDerek Schmidt: Yes, that's correct.\nBudd Bugatch: So you do want debt down to zero. And once debt to zero, what's the use of cash look like? What's your thought process?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. In terms of capital allocation, Budd, so I laid out earlier in the call these pursuits to expand our penetration in new markets. We would look for value enhancing acquisitions that would accelerate our penetration into one of those three areas. Either help us address the needs of younger consumers, expand our product category penetration beyond the living room, or expand our sales distribution beyond the independent retailer. So the areas that we've kind of talked about in terms of acquisition priorities would be potential outdoor company, a direct-to-consumer company, or a company with a modern mid-price lifestyle kind of brand. So we would expect to start to potentially accumulate some cash in the balance sheet and more proactively look for value enhancing acquisitions.\nBudd Bugatch: And does that take you out of manufacturing or into retail or into or out of furniture or out of…\nDerek Schmidt: No, we're squarely focused on residential furniture. Certainly in the midterm, we do not desire to be in retail ourselves. So this is again, this is leveraging our core competence and bringing in new capabilities within furniture wholesaling for lack of a better term.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter, and best of luck for the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.\nDerek Schmidt: Thanks, Budd.\nJerry Dittmer: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jerry Dittmer for any closing remarks.\nJerry Dittmer: Great. Thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank all our Flexsteel employees for their dedication and outstanding performance during the quarter. And thanks to all of you for participating in today's call. Please contact us if any additional questions. And we look forward to updating you on our next call. Everybody, have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

Our earnings release, which we issued after market close yesterday, Tuesday, October 31, is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.flexsteelindustries.com, under News and Events.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Dittmer. Jerry?\nJerry Dittmer: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to share with you our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results. While our industry faces challenging business conditions and several of our publicly traded peers have seen double-digit sales decreases in the recent quarter, we have leveraged our growth initiatives to offset these challenges and deliver sales within 1% of the prior year quarter. This year-over-year sales comparison is adversely impacted by the elimination of ocean freight surcharges, which reduced revenue by approximately $7 million, compared to the prior year quarter. In the prior year, we used this surcharge mechanism to pass through higher cost of ocean container delivery, which were significantly inflated due to supply chain issues. Container delivery costs normalized throughout the last fiscal year and we subsequently eliminated this surcharge. Excluding the $7 million impact from this ocean freight surcharge elimination, sales growth related to unit volume and product mix was a robust 6.8%, reflecting our strong sales execution and the momentum of our growth initiatives. Our ability to drive growth in a difficult industry environment reinforces that we are competing well and gaining share. In addition, we continue our focus on operational efficiency and cost savings, which propelled a gross margin of 19.5% in the first quarter, compared to 16% in the same quarter of the prior year. This margin expansion helped fund additional investment in growth initiatives while still delivering improved operating income of $1.9 million, compared to $0.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. We expect the business environment in the near term to remain challenged. The industry is arguably already in a recession as consumers have shifted discretionary spending to experience-based expenditures like travel and entertainment and away from higher-priced hard goods like appliances, electronics and home furnishings. The list of headwinds working against the economy and consumer spending continues to grow. High interest rates and mortgage rates, rising fuel prices, geopolitical concerns, U.S. government uncertainty, student loan payment restart, shrinking pandemic savings, and rising credit card debt. Despite these external challenges, our team isn't deterred and remained intensely focused on profitably growing our business in fiscal year 2024. We enter the second quarter with positive momentum and are confident in our ability to grow sales both compared to last year and the first quarter, while also improving gross and operating margins over the first quarter. Our strategies are working. We'll continue to innovate, drive expedient and relevant new product development and build strong brands. Regardless of demand uncertainties, we remain aggressive in identifying new growth opportunities while prudently managing costs and investing for future growth and profit enhancement. I'll now turn the call over to Derek to discuss our strategic initiatives and financial results as well as our outlook for quarter 2 2024. I'll be back at the end of the call with some closing comments on what we see ahead.\nDerek Schmidt: Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Like Jerry, I'm confident in the outlook for our business while cognizant of the near-term headwinds we may face. At the recent October market in High Point, North Carolina, we held numerous encouraging conversations with customers, suppliers and others in the industry. I'll share a few highlights of the quarter, what we took away from High Point market, and how they shape our view of the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we debuted our new showroom at the October Market along with 36 new product groups. Our sales team was energized and excited to take customers and suppliers through the new showroom, which provided an excellent showcase for both our current and new product lines. The feedback from customers was extremely positive. Many noted that the traffic and energy levels were exceptionally strong in our showroom compared to others they visited, which gives us encouragement that we are competing well and differentiating through our focus on innovation and new products. Second, on past calls, I have mentioned that Zecliner, our new sleep solution recliner has been a big success. Through the first quarter, we have over 760 retailers that have placed the product on their floors with even more committing to initial placement orders at the October Market. Notably, we have seen repeat orders in excess of 60% from retailers who initially placed the product, demonstrating strong adoption by consumers. We also recently engaged an independent third party to conduct a sleep study of individuals who don't regularly sleep in a bed. The study compared their experience sleeping in the regular recliner chair or sofa over a 4-week period to sleeping in a Zecliner over the same time period, analyzing over 700 nights of sleep. This study found that Zecliner significantly improved perceived sleep among people who originally slept at least part of the night on a different recliner, chair or sofa. The study results also showed that 95% of individuals felt Zecliner was a better solution than other products they used in the past and 84% felt Zecliner helped improve their sleep. These results show the strength and potential of our product in this category. And we plan to expand our marketing using these study results. In addition, at the October Market, we introduced an extension to our line with [ Zofa ], a sleep solution sofa. We plan to continue to innovate and expand offerings in the sleep solutions space. Third, we continue to expand the distribution of Flex, our modular seating line to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers where it is placing well. We also launched several differentiated functional pieces to the Flex line at October Market, including a technology hub, storage center, pet bed, and a sleep kit. We will continue innovating and expanding this platform to drive future growth as well. Finally, we continue to grow our big box distribution, notably with Costco through costco.com. Revenue generated through this customer contributed to the 10.7% growth in e-commerce sales in the quarter. In addition, we recently expanded our marketing effort through our first Costco in-store roadshow event to showcase our Flex modular furniture collection. We have several more of these events scheduled throughout the remainder of the fiscal year and look forward to using these in-store events to further our brand awareness and customer reach. The positive energy from our interactions at Market and the success of our strategic initiatives, provides us confidence that we are well positioned to navigate the choppy near-term industry conditions and deliver sales and profit growth for the fiscal year. With that, I'll now give you some additional details on the financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. For the quarter, net sales were $94.6 million, within our guidance of $92 million to $100 million provided during our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. As Jerry noted earlier, sales growth related to unit volume and mix, which excludes ocean freight surcharges, was a strong 6.8% in the quarter. And we feel we have sustainable growth momentum in both the retail and e-commerce channels. From a profit perspective, the company delivered operating income of $1.9 million or 2% of sales in the first quarter, which was within our guidance range of 1% to 3%. Moving to the balance sheet and statement of cash flows. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3 million, working capital of $118.3 million, and a balance on our revolving line of credit of $33 million. Working capital and our debt balance did increase from the fourth quarter due to a reduction in payables and the normal timing of several large annual payments occurring at the beginning of our fiscal year. Going forward, we expect inventory reduction and profit improvement to be meaningful sources of cash in fiscal year 2024 to aggressively pay down debt. Looking forward, sales guidance for the second quarter is between $94 million and $100 million, which represents sales growth of 1% to 7%. Similar to the first quarter, year-over-year net sales comparisons will be unfavorably impacted by the elimination of ocean freight surcharge revenue of approximately $4 million. Excluding the ocean freight surcharge impact, growth related to unit volume and mix has been forecasted between 5% and 12%, reflecting the strong momentum of our growth initiatives and continued share gains. Regarding profitability, we expect second quarter gross margin to improve from the first quarter with a forecasted range of 19.6% to 20.6%. We expect gross margins to grow throughout the fiscal year with expected sales growth and continued realization of our cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives. We continue to prudently manage SG&A spending while investing in our growth initiatives, and expect SG&A costs between $16 million and $17 million for the quarter, similar to the first quarter. We are projecting operating income as a percent of sales in the range of 2% to 4% for the second quarter and expect operating income margins to improve throughout the year in parallel with forecasted gross margin improvement. The most significant drivers of variability in the second quarter guidance range continue to be consumer demand and competitive pricing conditions, both of which will be shaped by macroeconomic factors. Regarding our cash flow outlook, working capital is expected to be a major source of cash flow in the second quarter and full year as we anticipate inventories to steadily decline throughout the year. Near-term priorities for cash remain reducing debt, resourcing new innovations, and funding modest capital expenditures mainly related to cost savings projects and continued modernization of IT systems. We expect debt levels at the end of fiscal 2024 in the range of $0 million to $15 million. For the second quarter, we expect capital expenditures between $1.5 million and $2 million. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be in the range of 29% to 32%. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry to share his perspectives on our outlook.\nJerry Dittmer: Thanks. While we expect business conditions to be choppy in the near term, I am confident that we are taking the right steps to secure profitable growth and our long-term growth outlook remains promising. We are well positioned to successfully deliver improved earnings and an even stronger balance sheet over the remainder of fiscal year 2024. With that, we will open the call to your questions. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Anthony Lebiedzinski of Sidoti. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Good morning and thank you taking the questions. So I guess, first, just a quick comment. I thought it was helpful that you guys provided the impact of freight surcharges for first quarter of last year and you gave an indication about the second quarter. So as we look beyond the second quarter as far as the second-half of last year, was there anything meaningful to call out as far as rate surcharges? Or was it less of an issue? If you could just remind us about that.\nDerek Schmidt: Yes, Anthony, it's Derek. So it dissipates throughout the year. So for the third quarter, the impact of the surcharges would be a little less than $3 million. And in the fourth quarter, it's a little less than $1 million. So we unwound those ocean freight surcharges gradually throughout the year, hence why you see a decrease in the year-over-year impact to revenue.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Yes, thanks, Derek. And then in terms of the growth initiatives, can you perhaps maybe quantify how much that impacted your first quarter sales results, and as far as your outlook for the balance of the year? Just looking to get more clarity about how much is Flex, Zecliner and big-box expansion helping you guys?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. No, the color I can provide, Anthony, is I prefer not to give you exact numbers, but the growth initiatives were a substantial factor in terms of our growth. If you were to take those out, I mean, our business would probably be down not as large as certainly our external kind of peers, but it would be down probably in the high single-digit, low double-digit range. So really, the growth initiative -- the good thing is the growth initiatives are working, we're building momentum, and we believe, again, there's room for the revenue from those growth initiatives to continue to expand, which we believe at this time will allow us to grow every single quarter here year-over-year for the remainder of the year.\nJerry Dittmer: The other piece of that too, Anthony, is we continue to come out with more line extensions and more of these growth initiatives that are going to also help us in the future. You might remember at Market, both Flex and Zecliner, there are additional SKUs and products that we brought out to enhance those even more.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Yes, yes. And certainly, the new showroom looked pretty good as well. So as far as the gross margin improvement, certainly nice job there as well. And it sounds like you expect continued improvement there. So I mean, given the overall improvements to the business, I mean, as we look out beyond fiscal '24, I mean can we get to -- I mean, what's your sense as to like where gross margins could go to, assuming, of course, a normalized demand environment?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. I think, certainly, our target to end the year would be closer to 21%. So exit this year closer to a 21% gross margin. And then continue to kind of grow the top line and leverage fixed cost to expand that into fiscal year '25.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: All right, that's very helpful. And then in terms of SG&A dollars, so those were up around 13% looks like for this quarter here. And I know you gave guidance for Q2 as well. But then kind of looking beyond that, I mean, I know you guys are investing in your growth initiatives. But I guess longer term, I mean, how fast will those expenses grow? I mean what is your outlook for that?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. I would expect, Anthony, for the remainder of the year for SG&A -- quarterly SG&A to kind of be within that $16 million to $17 million range per quarter. I think as we think about fiscal year '25, I would expect SG&A to grow at a lower rate than the overall top line. So we would expect to leverage fixed costs, including SG&A investments kind of going forward. So there is more investment there to be had to continue to propel the top line, but it would grow at a rate lower than our overall top line, in future years.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: All right. Well, sounds good. That's all I have. I'll pass it on to others. Well, thank you very much, and best of luck.\nDerek Schmidt: Thanks, Anthony.\nOperator: The next question is from Bud Bugatch of Water Tower Research. Please go ahead.\nBud Bugatch: Good morning. Jerry and Derek, congratulations on a good quarter. I had a couple of questions. I know that the sales growth in dollars were 6.8% excluding the freight surcharge on an apples-to-apples basis. But on a units basis, you talked about units and mix, can you give us an idea on units how that growth was like, for example, upholster receipts, how did that grow year-over-year?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. The way we think about the product categories, Bud, manufactured kind of stationary and sourced soft seating are probably our largest categories. They encompass almost about 90% of our sales. So to give you some perspective on units, our sourced soft seating business on units was up 13.7% year-over-year and manufactured stationery was up 3.7%. So we feel good about both of those numbers, and I think they're reflective of the fact that we're competing well in the market and gaining share.\nBud Bugatch: And the manufactured growth is where you would get leverage on cost of goods sold, is that the way to think about that? The sourced product is primarily variable cost?\nDerek Schmidt: Primarily -- I mean there's two ways to think about it. Manufactured, certainly, we'd be leveraging our fixed cost structure related to our plants. But we also have three distribution centers. And so the way I think about growing our sourced business, that does leverage the fixed cost of our distribution network as well.\nBud Bugatch: Okay, thank you. That gets me into the cost of goods sold and the composition of it. But I think, if I remember right, and correct me if I'm wrong, because my memory is old like I am, and failing. You had talked about a couple of years ago maybe getting gross margins into that 20% range, and that kind of was the target. And if I look back historically, I think the largest -- the highest gross margin percentage that I see going back five or six years ago, particularly for that second quarter was like about 22.6% for the end of the year, maybe close to 23%. Is that the high watermark? Where are you looking to -- and how do you get there?\nDerek Schmidt: So first of all, when you look back four or five years ago, you have to remember that the composition of our business was much different than it is today. Recall that we exited hospitality, health care, commercial office, RV seating. Those businesses -- many of those businesses had a higher gross margin, but they also had a significant SG&A load. And so the split between gross margin and SG&A as a percent of sales has changed because of that mix. So one, the historical comparisons aren't the best benchmark. That said, going forward, we've talked about our aspiration is to get gross margins up in that 22% to 23% range. And I think with continued top line growth, with prudent management of our fixed cost structure, and continued cost savings, we have a path to get there over the next several years.\nBud Bugatch: Okay. And MLO or the components of cost of goods sold, how should we think about that? Materials, particularly in the manufactured, somewhere around 50%, Labor 10% and the balance between Overhead and distribution and transportation. How do you get there?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. You're not probably too far off, Bud. Materials -- it's a little bit difficult because on the sourced side, we're buying finished goods. So I don't have visibility in terms of the breakout between materials, labor overhead for our sourced business. But in general, materials, 50% to 60%, you're right, labor and overhead kind of in that 20% to 25% range, and then logistics about 15%.\nBud Bugatch: And the logistics would impact primarily the -- I mean, not primarily, but the sourced goods would be primarily a logistics hit to cost of goods sold. You bring the inventory in and you add logistics cost to the inventory and it works its way through as it's sold, is that the way to think about that? And that's where you get the...\nDerek Schmidt: No. The inbound costs, so container cost and then drayage for sourced goods into our DC, those are all capitalized parts of the finished costs. So when I talked about logistics, that 15%, that is the cost of outbound shipments to our customers as well as our distribution centers and then any inter-plant, inter-DC kind of transfer costs as well.\nBud Bugatch: Got you. Okay. That's very helpful. And other for me on the sales, you talked about Costco and the sales lift of 6.8%. How much of that was due to Costco for the quarter? And what's the -- how much is due to maybe gaining -- you're competing well, so would tell me your you're gaining new accounts. So can you look at sales that way?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. If I decompose the 6.8% growth, Costco probably made up about 2.5% of that. So take that away, we still feel like we're competing really well in our core business within our traditional retailers.\nBud Bugatch: So that 4.3%, how much is same location or same customer and how much would be new customer?\nDerek Schmidt: There's not a lot of new customers. For the most part, I mean, where we're driving penetration is with our largest, most strategic retailers who we believe are going to be the winners in the future within the business. And that's really where we're gaining share.\nJerry Dittmer: The other place that we're gaining this year is obviously with the Zecliner and the Flex and other things like that, and those enhanced product lines, those are the other things that are driving a lot of that.\nBud Bugatch: So that's new floor space in existing retailers -- but many of those retailers are dedicated to you, right?\nDerek Schmidt: Correct. That's a good way to look at it. Yes. I mean the other corollary is -- I mean, we track the number of placements that we have for every single one of our products and the number of placements is growing. And we know retail space isn't growing. So again, that would give us another encouraging indication that we're gaining share in retail.\nBud Bugatch: That's a great maths. Do you have a percentage that you're willing to share on percentage of placement growth?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes, it's been -- I mean, over the last couple of years, between 5% and 10%, kind of high-single-digit.\nBud Bugatch: That's great. And last for me, the receivables look like you're looking like, if my math is right, somewhere around 32 days versus something closer to 40 days at the end of the year, the health of your retail base, can you talk a little bit about that? Are those the right numbers?\nDerek Schmidt: No. I mean we typically run around that 30 to kind of 33-day range. So that doesn't typically change. The only thing is, dependent on if we have heavy sales in the last month of the quarter, that will be what SKUs, accounts receivable either up or down. So overall, we're feeling good about the overall quality of credit and AR. Obviously in this uncertain economic time, we're watching credit concerns closely, but feel good about the quality of AR. No concerns or issues there.\nBud Bugatch: Okay. And so the delinquencies are not particularly significant, over 30?\nDerek Schmidt: No.\nBud Bugatch: Okay. Great. And 30 is the normal term -- would that be your normal terms?\nDerek Schmidt: 30 to 33, yes, in terms of days. But...\nBud Bugatch: Thank you very much. Congratulations and good luck on the balance of this calendar year and the fiscal year.\nDerek Schmidt: Thanks, Bud.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from John Deysher of Pinnacle. Please go ahead.\nJohn Deysher: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Looks like a solid quarter. I just have a couple of quick questions. First, what was the backlog at the end of the quarter?\nDerek Schmidt: Around $48 million. Yes. So relatively unchanged from where it was at the beginning of the year.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. Great. Another balance sheet question. I noticed other assets, other current assets are up to $9.2 million. It's been growing. And I'm just curious, what's in that other assets bucket? And why is that increasing?\nDerek Schmidt: Yes. There are two things, John. Every year in the first quarter, we prepay our annual insurance, and we also prepay our annual SAP software license. So those two things combined are worth about $2.5 million. So that was the increase in Q1.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. So that may come down going forward?\nDerek Schmidt: Correct. And that's our normal cadence. Typically, we pay those in full at the beginning of each fiscal year.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. That makes sense. What's the status of the Mexicali plant? I know you haven't opened it. It's a relatively new plant, I think, built within the last couple of years. What's the status of that at this point?\nJerry Dittmer: Yes, John. The status right now is, with the current environment, we didn't see a need that we'd be moving in there in the short-term. So we basically have it leased out at this point in time. And it's something we'll come back and visit every six to 12 months. But for the next year, it's -- we basically have it leased out about 95%.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. And what, the lease is month-to-month or year-to-year?\nJerry Dittmer: They're year-to-year with -- obviously with options, and there's two different parties in there. And we'll just really continue to look at our demand and when we'll need it and continue to work with these folks that are leasing it right now.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. That's good news. What -- when does it roll over, at the end of the year?\nJerry Dittmer: Different times. One of them rolls out in the fourth quarter, the other one will roll out first quarter next year.\nJohn Deysher: Great. And finally, on the availability, I think the press release said $27.6 million. That's down pretty substantially from the $45.8 million at the end of the year. What was the reason for that decline in availability?\nDerek Schmidt: It's largely due to inventory reduction. So I mean, at its peak, our inventory was over $190 million. Today it's $120 million. So that line of credit is an asset-backed facility.\nJohn Deysher: All right, I've got that. But inventory was pretty steady, looking at it over the last four quarters or so, between $110 million and $122 million and your availability was up always above $40 million. So it's not clear to me, I mean, the inventory has been about the same, it's not dropped significantly. So what -- why is the availability down so low?\nDerek Schmidt: I'll have to look at the specific periods and get back to you, which I'm glad to do.\nJohn Deysher: Okay, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nDerek Schmidt: Okay.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jerry Dittmer for closing remarks.\nJerry Dittmer: In closing, I would like to thank all of our Flexsteel employees for their dedication and outstanding performance during the quarter. Thanks to all of you for participating in today's call. Please contact us if you have any additional questions. And we look forward to updating you on our next call. Everybody, have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
