At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Todd Friedman, Senior Vice President of Invest Relations. Please go ahead.\nTodd Friedman: Thanks, operator. Welcome everyone to our fiscal third quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Rajeev Singh, and our Chief Financial Officer, Steve Barnes. Shantanu Nundy, our Chief Health Officer, will join for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Before turning the call over to Rajeev, please note that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating Accolade's performance. Details on the relationship between these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and the reconciliation thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website. Also, please note that certain statements made during the call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results for Accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call. For additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the SEC, all of which are available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Rajeev Singh.\nRajeev Singh: Thank you, Todd. I'll begin by summarizing the four key themes to my prepared remarks today. One, we had an excellent quarter on both the top and bottom line and we're raising guidance for the year as a whole. Two, we're reaffirming our outlook for our next fiscal year. It will be our first profitable year as a company while continuing to grow our revenue at 20% per year. Three, our strategy has yielded sustainable market differentiation, which in turn has led to yet another year of strong bookings growth and incredible opportunities for growth inside of our customer base. And four, based on the strength of that sustainable differentiation, we're raising our profitability guidance on our five-year outlook. By all accounts, Q3 was another successful quarter for Accolade. We're well positioned to execute on our long-term objective to build a great and enduring company important to the future of American healthcare. Let me start with the third quarter highlights and then I'll provide more color on our outlook. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both ahead of our guidance for fiscal Q3. Revenue in the quarter was $99.4 million, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.6 million, both ahead of our previous guidance. With these results, we're also raising our guidance for the full year. You'll hear more details about that guidance for this year in Steve's remarks. Turning to next year, fiscal 2025, we're reaffirming our commitment to 20% revenue growth and 2% to 4% adjusted EBITDA for the year. Our confidence in this guidance is based on the strength of our bookings to date. We've had a strong selling season. We've already exceeded last year's ARR bookings of $72 million and we're well on pace for growth of more than 20% over last year. Positively, as we've mentioned before, the selling season now rolls throughout the year, particularly as it relates to our newer offerings like Accolade Care and ExpertMD, and the continued impact of our growing health plan channel. This booking strength and diversification reflects our differentiation versus our competition and the continued evolution of advocacy into a must-have category for employers looking to control costs. Next, let's talk about why Accolade is the differentiated platform for our customers and well positioned for the future. First, our physician-led advocacy teams are more than just navigators with the ability to deliver care, integrate with brick and mortar care teams and local networks, and solve the access to care problem that we call the position gap. We deliver more than navigation. We deliver better healthcare for our customers that provably lowers costs. Second, resolving the complexity of American healthcare at scale takes more than just our incredible, relentless healthcare advocates. It requires a next generation technology stack driven by artificial intelligence, digital engagement capabilities, and next generation recommendation engines for both our members and our care teams. Accolade delivers on that promise. Third, this multi-trillion dollar regional complex industry has long desired an open platform, shared data sets, closed loop reporting, and ultimately real collaboration. Accolade's growing trusted partner ecosystem delivers the integration of partners in critical categories, and delivers real technology integration, choice for our customers, and improved engagement for our members. Finally, employers have never had true transparency into how the system is performing for their people, either economically or from an engagement perspective. Accolade delivers live, real-time reporting for every customer via our True Health dashboard that highlights who we've engaged and where they are in their journey, along with operational metrics that give our customers confidence in the road ahead. For our customers, these differentiators give them the confidence to choose Accolade over the rest of the industry. And for our shareholders, those differentiators represent an engine of sustainable growth in new bookings, in incremental services that grow revenue per customer, and in technology innovation that drives expanding unit economics into the future. Let me expand on that last point regarding unit economics with some simple but powerful examples about how Accolade leverages artificial intelligence. For our care advocates, we use AI to monitor engagement quality, to summarize encounters and follow-up items, and to route tasks and members to advocates who have experience with their specific need, among other things. Every step of the way, we're improving efficiency while also improving quality for our members by reducing the opportunities for human error. We also use AI in our engagement with healthcare providers, doing risk analysis for every member and building decision and workflow engines to drive better outcomes, among other use cases that support our clinical engagement. Not every member journey is identical, so we use AI to guide the next best action for our physicians and also help them to keep abreast of and adhere to evidence-based guidelines. Lastly, we use AI for analytics for operational excellence. Some of our investment areas are workforce management, reading customer satisfaction sentiment, and predicting engagement levels. All of these drive efficiency and improve the member experience. These are just some of the simple examples where our leadership in AI and technology investment will yield value for our operations in efficiency, quality, and value, and for our shareholders through improving unit economics. At scale, these investments in technology give us better visibility to long-term profitability. It's with that in mind that we are upwardly revising our five-year plan that calls for revenue of more than $1 billion and now adjusted EBITDA between 15% and 20% of revenues in fiscal 2029, which is a 5 percentage point raise from our Capital Markets Day in May. With that positive news, I'll turn the call over to Steve to give you more color on our financial and operational performance. Steve?\nSteve Barnes: Thanks, Raj. First, I'll recap the results for the fiscal third quarter and then provide details on our outlook and forward guidance. We generated $99.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The outperformance relative to our guidance was largely due to early recognition of approximately $2 million of savings-based performance revenue. I'll note that we previously called out early recognition of performance-based revenue totaling $2 million in fiscal Q2 and $1 million in fiscal Q1. From a year-to-date perspective, through the end of fiscal Q3, we've earned and recognized approximately $5 million in aggregate performance-based revenue that at the outset of the fiscal year was projected to be earned in fiscal Q4. Fiscal Q3 adjusted gross margin was 46.3% compared to 45.9% in the prior year period, and adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was a loss of $4.6 million. The positive performance versus guidance reflects the revenue over-performance, as well as the impact of the cost reductions via the workforce realignment that we announced earlier this year, along with a continued focus on spend management as we turn toward profitability in fiscal 2025. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents totaled $230 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter. During the third quarter, we capitalized on an opportunity to improve our balance sheet through the repurchase of $76.5 million of our outstanding convertible notes at a discount for an aggregate purchase price of $65.8 million. The remaining $211 million of outstanding notes are not due for more than two years, and we are confident in our outlook to generating positive operating cash flows with more than adequate capital on hand to achieve our plans without reliance on raising additional capital. Now turning to guidance, on the strength of our Q3 results, we are raising our full fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $411 million to $415 million, representing pro-forma year-over-year growth of 21% to 22%. We are also improving our full-year outlook for adjusted EBITDA loss for fiscal 2024 to a range of $6 million to $10 million as we turn the corner on our way to a full year profitability in fiscal 2025. With respect to the fiscal fourth quarter, keep in mind my earlier comments that we recognized about $2 million of PG revenue in fiscal Q3 that shifted from fiscal Q4. With that, we are providing fiscal Q4 guidance today of revenue in the range of $121.5 million to $125.5 million, and positive adjusted EBITDA in the range of $16 million to $20 million. I'd like to call out a couple notable points about fiscal Q4. First, it will be our first $100 million revenue quarter. Consider that when we went public 3.5 years ago, we had recently completed our first $100 million revenue fiscal year, so this is a tangible milestone for our company. Second, fiscal Q4 will be our first significantly positive adjusted EBITDA quarter, demonstrating the underlying earnings power in our model and marking a strong launching point for next year when we expect to deliver full year profitability. One of the key questions we often get is about understanding the revenue ramp from fiscal Q3 to fiscal Q4. There are two factors that primarily impact Q4 revenue relative to the other three quarters. The recognition of healthcare cost savings based performance revenue and net new revenue from customers with January 1st go live dates related to new bookings which Raj noted earlier. These are both rooted in highly visible contracted revenue. Let me take a moment to provide a short explanation of the dynamics of our healthcare cost savings performance guarantees. Those savings guarantees are measured according to a customer health plan service year, which typically aligns to the calendar year. Given a one to two month timing lag to receive claims data, we currently have the visibility to most of the claims data required to measure our cost savings performance in calendar 2023. The claims data we already have in hand provides a high degree of visibility to the savings-based revenue we expect to achieve in fiscal 2024, majority of which gets recognized in our fiscal Q4 P&L. This dynamic, which has been consistent year-over-year, along with a track record of consistent historical execution against our performance guarantees, has contributed to a high level of confidence in the achievability of our forward guidance. Those two highly visible factors, savings-based PG revenue, plus January and February revenues associated with new customer bookings, lead to the revenue ramp in fiscal Q4, which has been the case for Accolade’s history. Now turning to the forecast for fiscal 2025, we are reiterating our guidance for 20% revenue growth and a positive adjusted EBITDA of 2% to 4% of revenue, which is roughly $10 million to $20 million. For fiscal 2025, we are not providing quarterly guidance today, but our historical quarterly revenue trend, whereby at the outset of a fiscal year, we forecast the majority of claims-based savings PG revenue in fiscal Q4 will continue to be a good starting point for your models. This aligns with our Capital Markets Day presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website. And I'll make one last point before taking questions. As Raj mentioned, we are upwardly revising our five-year plan to call for adjusted EBITDA margins of 15% to 20% of revenues in fiscal 2029. Our prior guide called for a 200 basis point to 300 basis point improvement each year after turning profitable next year. As we are now seeing the impact of our earlier cost reductions, the efficiencies we are driving through the business from AI and other technology-driven innovations, and the incremental margin impact of customers implementing multiple offerings and associated utilization-based revenues, we see profitable growth from here and believe we can deliver an annual improvement of 300 basis points to 400 basis points over the horizons of fiscal 2029. And with that, we'll open the call to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ryan Daniels from Blair. Your line is open.\nRyan Daniels: Yeah, guys, congratulations on the strong performance. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to hit on one that you mentioned regarding the ability to drive intra-year sales. It sounds like bookings are already great, so very good visibility there. But I think something novel that might be underappreciated, and I want to hear a little bit more about it, is your ability to push more intra-year sales. So Accolade Care, ExpertMD, and then also how you're leveraging health plan partnerships to do that. Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Thanks for the question, Ryan. This is Raj. In fact, it is a really important point, and so I'm glad you call it out. When you think about, in that context of the -- I think the phrase used was intra-year sales, think about it in a couple of components. The first is we have a base of advocacy customers who are excellent targets because of the nature of a really strong customer relationship and because of really strong member MTS for incremental Accolade services that can be layered on well past the beginning of a plan year when most deployments in a straight advocacy only business would occur. That entails things like virtual primary care, expert medical opinion, and of course, all of our trusted partner ecosystems. Beyond that, you also see the opportunity in -- to grow usage of existing services where customers had signed on to those services but we had yet to really fundamentally drive to the engagement levels associated with them. Again, same set of services, Accolade Care, expert medical opinion, and trusted partner ecosystem. Above and beyond that, getting to the health plan component part of the story, the opportunity in things like our Blue Shield California individual and family plan business, the opportunity to drive utilization up on a month-over-month basis is what you might refer to it in that context of in-year sales. All of it gives us the opportunity to continue to grow the business beyond the booking number that we traditionally talk about. But I appreciate you pointing out, Ryan, that that bookings number was also very strong this year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCraig Hettenbach: Great, thank you. Raj, just to follow up there, as you think through the approximate 20% growth you're targeting for fiscal ‘25, can you just touch on by kind of segment, the core advocacy, Accolade Care, and expert medical opinion, any nuances to think through in terms of how the different businesses are performing and kind of build up to 20%?\nRajeev Singh: I think, and I'll let -- Steve, I'll let you jump in and add some color commentary here. Ryan, excuse me, Craig, as you think about that in context first, we expect each of our core businesses to grow in that 20% range. That's part one of the story. Part two of the story is we expect that the business itself has opportunities to see incremental usage across any of our, what we call our variable usage offerings like expert medical opinion virtual primary care which give us potential offsides of that 20% number. Steve, what would you add to that?\nSteve Barnes: Sure, I’d just reiterate a couple of points here around the different offerings. Craig, to Raj’s point we’re really induced by the continuing demonstration of a broad set of capabilities, different offerings that are contributing to that overall 20% growth rate. And like we've talked about the last several quarters, we're continuing to see the advocacy business show up in a strong way in the approaching 20% growth rate. Expert medical opinion offering continuing to grow in that 20% range. And then the virtual primary care offering growing north of that 20% target for the reasons Raj mentioned, which gives us great confidence in the way we go forward, which is when we think about embedding a physician into an advocacy customer, it creates a differentiated opportunity for us to drive incremental revenues. And interestingly, back to Ryan's point about strong bookings groups, from the customers we've booked year to date, the vast majority of them, when they're an advocacy customer, were also bundling with that expert medical opinion and/or virtual primary care and oftentimes a trusted partner or more into that opportunity. So we’d show up with a starting point of booking with opportunities to drive incremental value for those members, more value for that customer in terms of financial returns, and Accolade obviously benefits from all that. We're seeing that all come together and show up in contributing towards that optimism we have on that growth rate, and it's really spread across those different offerings.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Ryan MacDonald from Needham. Your line is open.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter. Steve, maybe just expanding upon the last commentary as you look at the sort of segments of growth, with expert medical opinion, given all the success that you've had this year in cross-selling that, as we look out into next year, what maybe assumptions are you making in that 20% growth on, in terms of case rate volume growth? And now that we're starting to see some of those case rates start to rise, utilization in a lot of the health systems start to rise as we head into next year, what may be are assumptions you're building into that and potential opportunities for upside? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Great. Thanks for the question, Ryan. You have a really important point. A couple things. We are seeing the utilization of the EMO offering be strong. In fact, this most recent quarter in Q3, we saw strength in that business on a sequential basis relative to Q2 and likely reflecting some of those utilization trends you're alluding to in the hospital environment and so forth. One thing to remember about our EMO offering is most customers now are either on a case rate basis contract or are moving to one. That's why when you see in our financials or in the disclosures in our 10-Q, you'll see a continued growth in usage-based revenues or utilization-based revenues that's across the business, but very much the EMO part is contributing there. We think, as we look out the next year to your point, I think that 20% growth rate is very, very achievable from the standpoint of strengthened bookings for new customers and continuing strong utilization around that, both reflecting the current environment that you mentioned and also overall our ability to demonstrate the customers the value of the ROI on that service.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Jailendra Singh from Truist. Your line is open.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you, and thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the comments around bookings and selling season. You called out strength in new bookings. Were these opportunities which took a little longer to close last year, now you have clarity? Just wondering if you had any impact on the sales cycle last selling season because of GLP-1 taking a lot of mind share? And related to that, did you see a lot of not-now employer accounts last selling season, which might be giving you some increased confidence for the next selling season?\nRajeev Singh: Thanks for the question, Jailendra. In fact, what we talked about in our prepared remarks, Jailendra, was the fact that we had another very strong selling season. That selling season has -- ahead of where we were last year and in a great position to drive 20-plus-percent growth from a bookings perspective year over year. The consistency of the sale cycle and the consistency of the delivery of those new bookings on a year-over-year basis as we continue to grow our business, we think is reflective of the strong demand in the environment, number one, and number two, the differentiation that I spoke to in my prepared remarks. Even better news, which I think is a little different than the way you characterized it, it's not that we saw a number of field delay, but instead we're beginning to see the first inklings of the pipeline for real evaluations happening in calendar ‘24 and we're encouraged by the signs we see which is now that this would make it the third consecutive year that we've said those words that early results on the pipeline or the opportunities and evaluations that are developing here at the end of 2023, heading into 2024, give us continued visibility and bullishness on the demand for advocacy and navigation solutions, particularly those differentiated like Accolade’s, in an environment where corporations are concerned about healthcare costs and want to deliver better value for their employees.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Stan Berenshteyn from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Maybe digging in on PlushCare a bit more, just if we think about the interplay here, or factors driving growth here, you have [obviously consumer channel] (ph), you've called out GLP-1s here, you're getting incremental lift from enterprise. Can you just walk through the individual segments that I just discussed in terms of the expectations for growth as we think about next year? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Hey, Stan, thanks for the question. I'll start the answer and then Steve can jump in. When you think about our primary care business, I think it's imperative that you think about it in its components. We think about it that way because it's really fundamentally structured off of the same tech platform, off the same platform of physicians, off the same delivery philosophy as it relates to quality care. And in turn, when you think about the business in those two vectors, first, let's talk about the enterprise business. The enterprise business, we've seen extraordinary uptake of customers from the advocacy business taking advantage of our care service. In fact, we saw great adoption last year and even better adoption in fiscal ‘24, or calendar ‘23, fiscal ‘24. That adoption is really driven off this concept that we're embedding physicians into care teams. We're solving a problem we call the physician gap, which is fundamentally built around this or is pointing to this problem that exists in the healthcare system where people can't get to their primary care physicians even if they have one for nearly a month in real days. And because of that, we've got an audience where we can drive extraordinary utilization of our primary care service or of our care service within the advocacy business. That business continues to grow while at the same time our consumer business continues to grow. Both of them benefit from the fact that we're a primary care practice that deals with multiple conditions, including weight loss or diabetes management which is tied to GLP-1. We think of GLP-1 as yet another one of the factors driving the strength of that business and the consistent growth rate. Steve?\nSteve Barnes: Yeah, I’d just add, as today we're seeing that uptake that Raj spoke about on the enterprise side and that growth rate is very high, [well more than 20] (ph) off of a smaller base that's growing as we roll out to new customers and the higher utilization rates within that base and then there's the consumer business capability or channel continuing to grow as well. The other thing I'd point to, Stan, is the reason for people calling in or requesting an engagement with their primary care doc is across a multitude of channels or reasons. Certainly GLP-1s are contributors. This time of the year, flu seasons or respiratory is a contributor. We're seeing good balance across all those reasons. And ultimately, the reason people come to Accolade Care or PlushCare is because they're getting an outstanding experience with a primary care doc and we're in a unique position as Raj noted, with an employer customer in particular, to help fill that physician gap, get someone to a primary care doc very quickly and then become their longitudinal primary care doc as needed or supplement their brick and mortar on the ground up.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Jessica Tassan from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJessica Tassan: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. So, I had two quick ones. Just first off, is there any part of the early PG recognition in the third quarter or in the first three quarters of the year that relate to your conservative assumptions heading into the year? Or is that all just really a matter of timing? And then just secondarily, I was hoping you might be able to give us some color on the shape of the primary care revenue growth in FY ’25 should it step up kind of meaningfully in F 1Q as you have new enterprise contracts launched, or should we see sequential growth in each quarter of FY ‘25? Thanks again.\nSteve Barnes: Great. Thanks for the question, Jess. It’s Steve. First of all, on the PG revenue recognition, yeah, I think with a conservative, we start the year assuming we'll need the full year to earn those performance guarantees and then we oftentimes do earn them sooner than that. So yeah, I think you could think of it as the $2 million we pointed out this year we expected to earn for the year and we expected -- we assumed at the beginning of the year it happened in Q4, and then we oftentimes go after it. And I mentioned $5 million of cumulative revenue earned sooner than that Q4. Obviously we're really happy to see that. Whenever we can drive that, it adds visibility to Q4, both on the top line and on the bottom line because of the profitability of TGs. And with respect to the care business and launch, certainly we expect to launch new customers on January 1. But when we come back in April with our Q4 results and a more formal guide around fiscal ‘25, we'll get some more color around the different offerings and shape of that that you would expect for your own modeling.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from line of Richard Close from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nRichard Close: Great. Thanks for the questions. Congratulations. Steve, I was curious if you could go over the, I guess, revised long-term target on the margins in terms of the annual. You guys must have pretty good confidence to go ahead and do that. Can you break out a little bit in terms of thoughts on the cost savings contribution or the reorganization that you did and then maybe the bundled offerings component? Just a little bit more clarity there would be helpful.\nSteve Barnes: Yeah, absolutely. Richard, great to talk to you and appreciate the question. Yeah, absolutely important item in today's announcement is talk about the increase in our guide for that out year, that fiscal five year out to 15% to 20% revenues, profitability. As we're two or three quarters into the year since Capital Markets Day, when we talk about 10% to 15%, a few things have happened. One, we've demonstrated to ourselves that the cost actions that we took in realignment have yielded great results and in fact in some ways, by doing that, we're able to go faster and be more efficient and certainly realize cost savings all at the same time. That's one. Secondly, Raj spoke in his remarks in a few different ways about the way we're leveraging technology innovation, which is something that we've been doing at Accolade for several years. But on top of that, AI-driven capabilities that are making our frontline care teams more efficient, enable to getting members from one place to another or directly to another offering, all of that nets out to further confidence in gross margin expansion that’s assumed in our models as we get out into the next several years. So that's a contributor. And then certainly on the operating leverage side of the business, on the OpEx side of things, we're seeing that -- opportunities for that in a few places. One, we've made significant investments in product and technology. I think it's a very important differentiator for Accolade in terms of the platform that we've built. We'll continue to invest there at a growth rate that will be important and we think it outsizes other investments by other companies in our industry. Well, we are starting to see leverage there where we can really capitalize on the investments that have been made. So that'll net out to a lower growth rate on that number relative to our revenue margin expansion. And then otherwise, across the P&L, we see other opportunities. But that's one in particular that we see contributing towards that bump up in the long-term guide.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAllen Lutz: Thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow up on that last one. I guess, Steve, you mentioned that a lot of this is driven by AI, but not all of it. I'm curious, are -- is what's embedded in that 5 percentage point increase in the profitability targets? Is that related to tools -- the AI tools that you already have available today, or is it based off of ones that you may deploy in the future? I'm just curious how you think about that in the context of getting to that fiscal ‘29 target and the path with 300 bps of margin expansion per year. Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Hey, Allen. This is Raj. I'm going to take a cut at that question first, and then we'll let Steve add any additional color. Think about gross margin expansion or unit economics expansion and overall economic expansion of the business with a couple of drivers. The first is the idea that advocacy customers who are taking advantage of incremental services like primary care, expert medical opinion, and our trusted partners are taking advantage of very high gross margin or strong unit economics offerings as it relates to our P&L and driving extraordinary value for their members. With each cohort that comes on, taking advantage of those services, we have an opportunity to continue to grow the usage of those services and in turn, drive better unit economics and better profitability. Over the last year to two years, we've seen the first cohorts and we've seen the results for those first cohorts, which give us great confidence moving forward about our capacity to continue to grow those, to grow the unit economics associated with those offerings and therefore the long-term profit margins of the business. The second wave of that story is the investment in technology that can drive efficiencies in the business. Those investments in technology can be non-AI oriented, meaning things like being extraordinarily efficient, consuming data from the rest of the ecosystem so that our implementation costs are going down on a year-over-year basis, or things like artificial intelligence where we can be more efficient as it relates to wrapping calls and doing call summaries, to consuming benefits information, to responding to queries for our members in a high quality way but at a lower cost. You would think about those two vectors as significant drivers of value and our capacity to see the whites of the eyes of those drivers of incremental unit economics over the last year to two years being the fundamental drivers of our confidence as it relates to improving our guidance on the fiscal year ‘29. Steve?\nSteve Barnes: Yeah, I'll just add that -- to that last point. Allen, I would think of it this way. These are tools and capabilities internally developed or in some cases, tools that we license and bring in-house that we're using today but have just begun to demonstrate the availability and capability to achieve but not nearly reach the full benefits that we see that will happen over the next several years as we more deeply embed those and get better and better at those and those feed their way back into the platform and the process that we have. So very much based upon tools that were in the earlier stages of deploying and have some proof points that in fact they are driving those kinds of efficiencies and ability to drive incremental usage-based revenues as Raj was starting his remarks with.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question is from the line of Stephanie Davis from Barclays. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I want to also go down the GenAI route for my question. Just given the differentiation that your care advocates really give the platform, I wanted to hear about what you would view as an automation opportunity versus what you would view as potential opportunity, but not something you would approach because it could potentially dilute your offering.\nRajeev Singh: Yeah, I think it's a really important question, Stephanie. So first of all, thanks for the question and thanks for joining us. Secondly, the way to think about this in the context of the millions of interactions that we have per year, those interactions can be phone-based, they can be messaging-based, but those millions of interactions involve understanding the member's need, building a relationship with the member, and then summarizing the transactions and following up on the transaction. The component of understanding the members' need and building a relationship require a human, require our people, whether those are our care advocates, our nurses, our doctors, or our specialists in any particular field. The capacity to summarize what occurred in those transactions, to follow up on those transactions in many cases with tasks that are repetitive, understanding a benefit, understanding a claim, inquiring from a health system or a health plan about the validity of a claim or the amount of a deductible, et cetera, are areas that could potentially be automated. Incrementally, another area where the company spends a significant amount of time is actually assessing the quality of our interactions in every one of those transactions -- every one of those millions of transactions. And so the capacity to assess the quality of those transactions by understanding our follow-up, by understanding the amount of time we're taking to follow up, by understanding the strength of the data collected about the interaction are all things where artificial intelligence and just traditional technology can play a significant role. And so absolutely, the idea of understanding a need and the idea of building a relationship, those are human attributes that we would be [loathed] (ph) to change or to in any way try to automate. But you see there's a huge slice of the pie left where we think artificial intelligence, Generative AI, and the companies and technologies that are littering the landscape to deliver value there are going to be really interesting to Accolade.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jenny Shen from BTIG. Your line is open.\nJenny Shen: Hi, this is Jenny Shen on for David Larsen. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarter. I just want to ask about the TRICARE contract, whether you have any updates there on a start date, how large the contract will be, and whether any of that is baked into your fiscal ‘25 guidance or the five-year outlook? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Hi, thanks for the question. As it relates to our government business, writ large, think about it in a couple of components today. Our Autism Care business continues to perform well, continues to deliver extraordinary value for the members that we're serving, as well as for the health plan/TRICARE organization. As it relates to the TRICARE contract or T5, it has not resolved that particular pilot organization -- that particular appeal has not resolved at this point and we're reluctant to give you any guidance as to when it will resolve given that it's outside of our control. What we can tell you is no material assumptions are baked into our out year guide or the guide that leads you to fiscal year ’29, $1 billion in revenues. What you should expect in the out year is that we've baked in rational assumptions knowing that we cannot control when the government appeal will finalize. And therefore, we've built a business based on what we have good visibility to for the year ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our last question for today will come from line of Jack Wallace from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nJack Wallace: Hey, thanks, team. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of them have been answered. I've got two. First, housekeeping items, very pro forma growth rate, comfortable sharing. Basically, performance ex the loss of large customers you had the last couple of quarters and I got a follow-up.\nRajeev Singh: I'm sorry, we lost your question about halfway through. Would you mind repeating it?\nJack Wallace: No problem. Is there a pro forma growth rate you're comfortable sharing, so growth ex the loss of the large customer last year?\nRajeev Singh: You mean for fiscal ‘24 or fiscal ‘25, Jack?\nJack Wallace: For this completed quarter. I think last quarter was 19% off of the 10.5% growth rate.\nRajeev Singh: Yes.\nJack Wallace: I'm just trying to get a sense for the drag.\nRajeev Singh: Sorry, I misunderstood your point. Yeah, it was about a 17% growth rate in the quarter on a pro-form basis for Q3.\nJack Wallace: Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask the visibility question in a slightly different way. Is there a mix shift in the level or the bookings through what's called nine or 10 months so far this year, that would be different than the visibility or the mix from last year? And I ask that because you made a couple of comments around some of the utilization-based opportunities as potentially providing upside. I was curious if there was a shift between the utilization-based and the non-utilization based bookings at this point going into the year.\nSteve Barnes: I think about it as the mix of the bookings is pretty similar year-over-year, which aligns roughly to the breakdown of the percentage of revenues in the business advocacy, expert medical opinion, virtual primary care. I think an important point though, to draw back to Rajeev's comments is that when we value a booking on a utilization-based item, we're going to be fairly conservative going in and then you'll see sometimes upside to that ARR or ACV number in terms of revenues realized as we -- that customer matures with us, we've engaged with that population and we drive utilization with that customer, which will get you to utilization-based revenue. So that's some of the dynamic in there that's driving that and we've seen that we've now got a couple of years under our belt, obviously, with selling bundled offerings and seeing that be fairly consistent with customers that have bundles.\nJack Wallace: Got it. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nSteve Barnes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to management for closing remarks.\nRajeev Singh: Thank you, everyone, for being with us today, and we look forward to catching up with you down the road.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accolade Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Todd Friedman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTodd Friedman: Thanks, operator. Welcome, everyone, to our fiscal second quarter earnings call. With me in our Houston office today are our Chief Executive Officer, Rajeev Singh; and our Chief Financial Officer, Steve Barnes. Dr. Shantanu Nundy, our Chief Health Officer will join for the question-and-answer portion of the call later. Before turning the call over to Rajeev, please note that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating Accolade's performance. Details on the relationship between these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and the reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website. Also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results for Accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call. For additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the SEC, all of which are available on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Rajeev Singh.\nRajeev Singh: Thank you, Todd. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Having now completed the first half of our fiscal year, there are four clear takeaways we'd like our shareholders to take from this call. First, we came in ahead of guidance and consensus in Q2 on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Second, with each passing quarter, we're closer to crossing the threshold to becoming a profitable, scalable business that will improve people's lives by changing the way healthcare is experienced. Third, the demand environment for our solutions remains strong. And fourth, we're presenting the market with a unique and differentiated perspective grounded in our routes in advocacy and powered by care delivery that our competition does not offer. That differentiation is bearing us fruit today and will continue into the future. I'll give you more color on those bullets in a moment. But first, let's head to second quarter highlights. First, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both ahead of our guidance for Q2. Revenue in the quarter was $96.9 million with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $8.8 million, both ahead of our previous guidance. Revenue highlights in the quarter were marked by continued strength in our virtual primary care and mental health offerings and some early recognition of performance-based revenues. Steve will give you all the details in his prepared remarks shortly. Over the past couple of months, there have been a number of consistent questions and themes in our investor meetings. I'll take the time today to hit on those topics and provide some current color. The first question we usually hear is about the selling season. The demand environment remains strong and the selling season continues at a solid pace. I'll remind investors here that with the growth of our middle market visits and customer selling motion, selling season is a year-long process at Accolade now. We've seen strength across verticals and customer size. As we've said before, more of the deals in the pipeline include multiple offerings and one or more trusted partner solutions. We view this as powerful validation of our overall vision, as well as the importance of embracing the ecosystem. This is reflective of continued interest in our category and our ability to win more than our fair share of the market with our differentiated personalized healthcare suite. The customer addition continue in both our traditional direct channel, as well as our rapidly growing health plan business. On the direct side, advocacy and bundled deals have included brand name manufacturers, retail, automotive, CPG, medical, real estate, public sector, financial services, and many others. And our health plan channel has delivered both quantity and quality, including some notable competitive takeaways. Through a combination of our direct sales force, expansions of existing relationships, and new logos through our health plan partners, Accolade Expert MD has added fantastic customers including Nissan North America, Tyson Foods, Phillips, TIAA, Spirit Airlines, Mutual of Omaha and Clorox this quarter. We also signed another major health plan partner to resell our advocacy and care solutions. In the quarters ahead, we'll give you more visibility into this partnership and how we see the target addressable market within our health plan relationships continuing to grow. We view these partnerships has incredible opportunities to drive sustainable growth for years to come. Next, let's talk about the competitive landscape and do it on a couple of vectors. First, in a traditional employer sales driven by ex-installment RFP in the strategic and enterprise account space, our competitors remain the usual suspects we've talked about in the past. Our win rate remains strong as evidenced by our growth in bookings over the last several years. Second, in pursuit of health plan relationships, our breadth of product offerings, our technology stack, and our open platform, oftentimes have us competing with low-engagement tech-only platforms instead of advocacy competitors, and our win rate there is very high. Why are our win rates strong? Because we are deeply differentiated from the rest of the market. Our customers know that one of the primary underlying causes of the dysfunction in the healthcare system is the complete fragmentation of the patient experience from understanding their benefits to how they're passed through from the care journey, from specialist to specialist, with no coordination or empathy. A fundamental principle of Accolade's strategy is to embed the physician in the entire care journey and to do so with advocacy at the core. Accolade connects physicians longitudinally with members through our advocacy and healthcare services. Accolade's treating physicians are uniquely positioned to connect brick and mortar physicians with members' benefit and pharmacy coverage through claims and benefits specialists. We can refer to and provide collaborative care with specialists, therapists, and point solutions for specific medical conditions that are covered under these members' employer health plan. This is a unique role that only Accolade plays with our customers, by providing the benefit advocacy and navigation services their members need to fully leverage their healthcare options, as well as operating a large and growing care delivery organization. We can fully engage the population, identify and reach high-risk members, and guide them down care pathways for major costs and misery drivers like cancer, MSK, diabetes, and more in a measurable, scalable, and deeply differentiated way. This is the next generation of advocacy and Accolade is leading the way. Recently, we've also fielded a number of questions about GLP-1 drugs and their impacts on our business. On this topic, the healthcare industry, employers, and consumers continue to learn from their experience with treatment regimens, usage patterns, and drug availability. Drug availability has clearly driven some fluctuation in usage on a month-over-month basis and we expect that volatility both upward and downward, to continue in the quarters ahead. That said, demand continues to be strong. And we've also seen the growing attractiveness of non-pharmaceutical alternatives like Verta, a company in our trusted partner ecosystem that we profiled in our Capital Markets Day, and specializes in diabetes reversal. We're also beginning to see new approaches to managing the cost and prescription of these drugs. The University of Texas system decided to stop covering weight loss drugs after seeing its costs for the drug increase from $1.5 million monthly to more than $5 million monthly over 18 months. And BCBS of Michigan has changed its policy so that patients will be required to be on a lifestyle modification program for at least six months before granting approval for weight loss drug therapy. What all of these data points reflect is the clear importance of engaging physicians in the weight loss treatment and a strong advocacy program to help ensure proper usage and program adherence. Finally, regarding the DHA T-5 agreement, we continue to await the final resolution of Health Net's protest, which we expect to hear over the coming months and we'll have more to report after that process resolves. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Steve to review the financials. Steve?\nSteve Barnes: Thanks, Raj. First, I'll recap the results for the fiscal second quarter and then provide details on the rest of fiscal 2024. As Raj noted earlier, we generated $96.9 million in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, representing 11% growth year-over-year, or 19% pro forma growth, excluding the impact of a large customer termination in fiscal ‘23. Revenue highlights in the second quarter included strong contributions across our offerings, reflecting the strength of a diversified personalized healthcare platform with multiple revenue streams. Notably, GLP-1 demand remained strong in the quarter, however, not at the surge level we saw in Q1, which contributed to a slight sequential decline in utilization-based revenues from fiscal Q1 to Q2. And in fiscal Q2, we also recognized approximately $2 million in performance guarantee-related revenue earlier-than-expected. We had initially forecasted these particular PGs to be earned in the amount of about $1 million in each of fiscal Q3 and Q4. As we've discussed previously and highlighted in our Capital Markets Day presentation on May 8, at the start of the fiscal year, we generally forecast that savings-related PGs will be recognized in our fiscal Q4. And when we earned those PGs earlier, we called them out to the extent they are notable. As a reminder, we had a similar pull-forward dynamic of about $1.5 million in last year's fiscal Q2. So, adjusting for both of those, as well as the customer termination, yield pro forma revenue growth of that same 19% noted earlier. Fiscal Q2 adjusted gross margin was 44.2% compared to 44.7% in the prior year period. The year-over-year change was driven by investments in our frontline care teams, including investments to launch our enterprise virtual primary care capability. There were also some duplicative staffing costs in Q2 associated with the workforce realignment actions we took at the end of fiscal 2023, as we transitioned some roles to new geographic locations. And as we discussed on Capital Markets Day, as well as our prior earnings call, we expect to see the benefits of the workforce realignment materialize in our P&L beginning in the second half of fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was a loss of $8.8 million. The positive performance versus our guidance reflects the revenue overperformance as well as a keen focus on spend management as we continue on our path to profitability. And turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents totaled $292 million at the end of the second fiscal quarter. And as a reminder, our convertible notes are not due for about 2.5 years. Finally, we currently have approximately 76.2 million shares of common stock outstanding. Now, turning to guidance. We remain optimistic about our outlook on growth, as well as our continued drive towards profitability. And with that, we are maintaining our full fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance in a range of $410 million to $414 million, representing pro forma year-over-year growth of approximately 21% at the mid-point. We are also maintaining our full year outlook on the bottom-line for an adjusted EBITDA loss for fiscal '24 in a range of $6 million to $12 million. With respect to the fiscal third quarter, keep in mind my earlier comment that we recognized about $2 million of PG revenue in fiscal Q2, that shifted about $1 million revenue each from fiscal Q3 and Q4. And with that, we're providing fiscal Q3 guidance today of revenue in the range of $95 million to $97 million, and adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $5 million to $8 million. Tying this adjusted EBITDA guidance to our full year target, we are forecasting positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth fiscal quarter between $17 million and $20 million, when we earn the bulk of our PG revenues in that fourth quarter, and realize the impact of new customer launches on January 1st, as we outlined in depth on Capital Markets Day. This projection for fiscal Q4, combined with our fiscal year-to-date performance on our bottom-line, give us visibility and confidence in our projections for 2% to 4% adjusted EBITDA positive in fiscal year 2025 and growing profitably thereafter. And with that, we'll open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction] One moment for our first question. And our first question will come from the line of Jeff Garrow from Stephens. Your line is open. Jeff Garrow, your line is open. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you. Raj, you mentioned a few competitive wins. Can you just touch on kind of what's differentiating relative to competitors in the marketplace? And then also any additional color on the multiple offerings? What else you see getting pulled through when customers choose to have more than one offering from you?\nRajeev Singh: Thanks, Craig. I think the core of our differentiation that we're seeing manifest in many of our platform-style deals where people are buying our advocacy service plus other services is the differentiation associated with having physicians embedded in the care teams, number one. Number two, the capacity to engage with brick and mortar care teams from those physician interactions to drive longitudinal care and improve the fragmentation or actually alleviate the issues, especially with fragmentation in the healthcare system. Our value proposition is built off of our incredible capabilities from an advocacy perspective that we've built over the years, now adding the incremental services and the incremental capabilities associated with physicians, behavioral health specialists, and specialists associated with our expert medical opinion service. As it relates to the capabilities or the product offering, we're seeing strength in advocacy in terms of new bookings. We're seeing strength in advocacy's expert medical opinion and customers taking advantage of our Accolade Care service. And so, incrementally we mentioned in the script or in the prepared remarks earlier, that an increasing number of customers are taking advantage of that trusted partner ecosystem as well.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Jessica Tassan from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJessica Tassan: Hi, guys. Thank you for the question and congrats on the strong quarter. I was hoping if you could maybe clarify, are you still expecting to see core navigation x-comcast returned to about 20% growth in FY '24? And maybe just, how much visibility do you have into that kind of 4Q ramp at this point? And any update on the annual growth rates for each of the businesses would be really helpful, if they are changed relative to prior expectations? Thanks so much.\nSteve Barnes: Hi, Jess, this is Steve. So, first of all, with respect to fiscal 2024, yes, we are still expecting that the growth rate overall to be in that range of 20%, 21% at the mid-point for the year, and lining up around the offerings where advocacy would be in the neighborhood of 20% growth rate and EMO or the Expert Medical Opinion offering in the range of 20% as well and the virtual primary care business growing a bit faster than that. We've got good visibility to that number. As Raj mentioned in his prepared remarks, the selling season has been -- the demand environment is strong, selling season we've had several good wins. Selling season continues right through here, but we've got good visibility to that for the end of this fiscal year and then visibility towards our 20% long-term growth rate that we've spoken about for next year in particular.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Jailendra Singh from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you, and congratulations on a strong quarter. I just want to go back to the selling season commentary. We have heard this year that there has been some delay in employer decision-making in terms of deciding on benefits for next year. Just curious if you have seen anything on that line among your client base or just the market in general? And related to that, clearly addressing the GLP-1 medications demand is on top of mind for most employers, so, are you seeing that outsized piece of wallet or mindshare impacting the discussion on other areas in any way? Clearly, new client wins for you guys don't seem to reflect any impact, but just curious, your thoughts on both the items.\nRajeev Singh: Yes. Jailen, I think, one, we're continuing to see a strong demand environment. We're continuing to see customers who buy for the three core reasons that they've always purchased solutions, our solutions. First, the desire to control trend lines. Second, the desire to improve the employee experience. And third, the desire to improve outcomes as it relates to healthcare outcomes for their employees. The commentary on GLP-1 is actually tied pretty nicely into that in many ways, Jailendra, meaning, what are employers definitely experiencing is this idea that a new medication has come onto the market that's driving healthcare costs up. They've got to adjust both from a policy perspective and understand how they are going to apply the appropriate clinical rigor to get the outcomes that they want and to drive the value for their employees that's necessary while controlling costs. And so, we think in some ways, absolutely it's driving an incremental spend which employers are going to have to fund from somewhere. But incrementally, it actually drives real demand for services like ours. I'll use this opportunity as a moment to defer to our Chief Health Officer, Shantanu Nundy, to talk a little bit about our clinical view on how to drive value for corporations as it relates to GLP-1 and the cost of GLP-1. Shantanu?\nShantanu Nundy: Yes. Absolutely, Raj. And Jailendra, always good to hear from you and it's a fantastic question. Yes, I think the key that we're hearing from employers and I think for me as a practicing physician makes sense clinically, is that we want to use the demand for GLP-1 to really create a much more comprehensive evaluation and a much more comprehensive plan for these members, right. I think too many actors in the healthcare system are sort of taking a patient who is interested in a GLP-1 and saying, okay, well, let me just prescribe that for you. And I think what we're able to do is, we have nutritionists on our staff. We are able to -- we have mental health therapists, so some of these folks, their underlying core issue is actually not related to a metabolic issue, but much more related to their mental health. And we have people like we alluded to in the opening remarks, who are actually just interested in addressing obesity and they're not aware of non-pharmacologic means like reversal of diabetes. And so I think our ability to be able to take them that moment of people's interest and sort of what's become a fad, really use that as a way to open up the much more longitudinal relationship and then have a very broad set of clinical tools and interventions at our disposal, I think is ultimately serving what members want and serving that -- the employer's interest in managing costs and improving outcomes.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jared Haase from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJared Haase: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. This is Jared Haase on for Ryan Daniels. A two-part question here and just sticking with the demand environment favorability here, I'm curious if there has been any changes in terms of sort of the themes that are driving that environment or is it still largely focused on cost savings? Just especially when we think about the expected price increases coming out next year? And then, related to that, as we think about sort of your ability to communicate ROI around cost savings. So, is there anything that's kind of meaningfully changed in terms of how you actually communicate that with clients? Do you have any additional sort of tools in the tool bag, so to speak, to really showcase that to prospects? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Thanks, Jared. As it relates to the first question, increasing trend line is always an issue, but also true, and it's been -- is increasingly true post the 2020 pandemic and shutdown, is that healthcare is becoming increasingly complex. And so while costs are always a driver even the four 2023, 2024 in their forecast have increased the trend line, the increasing fragmentation associated with increased point solution, fragmentation associated with the complexity of healthcare and the growth of third-party solutions that create that fragmentation is another real driver and that is a driver that points directly to solutions like ours that act as an umbrella to the healthcare system, paper over the fragmentation using tools like our advocacy teams or by physicians. And so I think it's a combination of both of those things that's really driving the demand for our services and perhaps any mismatch between the demand you might be hearing about for services that are more point solution-oriented or in other categories. As it relates to your second question, we are consistently showing our customers our value proposition as it relates to the interventions and the engagements that we're driving. Let's start there, how much of their population are we engaging, the interventions that we drive on their behalf, leading to the claims savings that actually we derive on their behalf as well. And so that's been very consistent over the years and our performance has been extraordinarily consistent as well.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Glen Santangelo from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGlen Santangelo: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Steve, I want to follow up with you on a couple of financial questions. When we look at your long-term guidance that you provided, that 5-year look out to fiscal '29, I think the assumption was, right, you're assuming 20% compounded annual revenue growth getting to a 10% to 15% margin in that year. Should we assume that the progression to get there will be somewhat linear and is it also a fair assumption to assume that your cash flow will somewhat equate to your adjusted EBITDA similar to maybe how it's trended this year? And I guess the reason I'm asking, right, is because I think as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you said the converts are only 2.5 years away into 2026 and basically, the amount of converts are almost exactly equal with the cash that you have. And those converts are trading somewhere in the low-80's and so I'm kind of curious as to what the plan is, and how we think about profitability and cash generation in the next kind of couple of years to prepare to basically refinance or do something with those converts? Sorry, I had lot of questions in there. My bad. I'll stop…\nRajeev Singh: Yes, yes. But all closely tied together, so I appreciate it. I'll kind of wrap them all together, Glen. First of all, you have it right that, that 20% growth rate CAGR that we're seeing is all based upon the demand environment and our execution over the past several years, and what we're seeing as Raj was just describing, and so we're expecting that to continue, call it over that foreseeable future, particularly that five-year period you talked about, which is, back in our Investor Day back in May, we laid out that path to 20% growth towards $1 billion. And fairly linear projection is how we're -- progression is how we're thinking about that EBITDA bottom-line. As we break through into next year in the positive territory there in adjusted EBITDA, our guidance is a range of 2% to 4% of revenue and we would expect as we always do, balancing growth with profitability as we've done historically on our way to breakeven and into profitability. And then going forward, there's a big opportunity in front of us, so we want to make sure we invest accordingly, which we will do, but also drive profitability on that path. As to your other parts of your question around free cash flow and balance sheet, yes, we would expect free cash flow to be within the range of adjusted EBITDA. There are always puts and takes around working capital timing, but the CapEx on the business is fairly modest, typically a few million dollars a year or a percentage point or two of revenue and that's usually with respect to things like the capitalized software and normal kind of workstation CapEx for our employees, but that's really the extent of it. With respect to the balance sheet, you're right, we've got about $292 million in cash on the balance sheet as we ended the August quarter. The converts are due in 2.5 years in August of 2026. And we would expect by that time to be well into cash flow positive and have a lot of optionality around whether we pay it down in part or in full or refinance it, we'll certainly be looking about that and talking about it with investors over the coming quarters, as that becomes closer, but we'll feel we'll have lots of optionality around that as we break through into cash flow positive and profitability.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAllen Lutz: Thanks for taking the questions. One for Raj or Steve. Raj, you talked about the rapidly growing health plan channel. Is there a way to frame how much of the 19% growth you saw in the quarter is coming from the health plan channel? And then I guess over time, is the expectation that that's going to grow as a percentage of growth? And then one for Steve. I guess is there anything to call out related to the GLP-1 dynamic, and why GLP-1-related activity declined quarter-over-quarter? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Yes. Sure. On the first question associated with breaking out health plan new bookings versus our employer or government new bookings, we haven't broken them out that way. What I will say is, when we talk about the announcement of a new partner like we talked about today, what we're really talking about is the expansion of our TAM, new opportunities that go into our health plan book of business. In this case, for advocacy, care, and our expert medical opinion capabilities, and that opportunity manifests over a -- over months, quarters, and years. And we expect that we're really excited about this particular opportunity. More to come in terms of commentary around that TAM in future quarters. We would expect over time, absolutely, that the health plan channel, which was relatively nascent if you knew our Company four years ago, there wasn't much of a health plan channel in terms of our go-to-market motion. Today, if you were to look across our book of business, it's a pretty material part of how we go forward and we're -- and we believe we're competing very effectively in terms of winning new opportunity to approach health plan books of business. So yes, we expect it to be a growing percentage of our new bookings 14 years ahead. Steve, you want to grab the GLP-1?\nSteve Barnes: Sure. And Allen, to your question about GLP-1, both Raj and I had some elements of comments in here that, overall, this has been a driver of interest and strength around our -- particularly around our primary care capabilities that consumers and employees of our commercial customers have inquired about and sought advice and prescriptions for that. We had a -- quite a big surge for it in Q1. Growth continues there, but not quite at that same level, so I -- in Q2 as we've read. I think even perhaps in one of your theses recently about some supply constraints happening that may affect some of those prescriptions and for us, visits. But I think what we are really positive about here as we think about the strength of the performance of the Company on the back of a diversified platform, that in any given quarter is not dependent upon outsized growth in any one of those. Importantly, the advocacy offering continues to grow at attractive rates, the same with medical -- extra medial opinion and primary care all growing along the lines of those growth rates we outlined in the past and certainly in depth on our Investor Day. So that's a bit about what we're seeing specifically with GLP-1 in terms of financially and more broadly across the platform.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Garro from Stephens. Your line is open. Jeff, your line is open. You may be on mute. Alright. We'll go ahead and continue. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of David Larsen from BTIG. Your line is open.\nDavid Larsen: Hi. Can you give a little bit of color around your ACV, your annual contract value in your pipeline? I think it came in at $309 million at the end of the last fiscal year, so if we increased that by 20%, should we expect $371 million for fiscal '24? And then your bookings, I think we're trying to get around $70 million annually, should we expect that number to be like $84 million for fiscal '24 annually, which would be up 20%, just any color there would be very helpful. Thank you.\nSteve Barnes: I'll kick it off guys, and feel free to jump in, of course. Dave, so with respect to bookings, Raj talked about selling season. The fact is, we're right in the midst of selling season right now and continuing to close deals around that. But you're right in the data you're quoting as far as end of year last year ACV and ARR. But we report out on those at the end of the fiscal year, so we'll come back to you given that those are key metrics that we hit in the fourth quarter call. But in terms of color as we both were commenting on in various ways, got good visibility towards our current year outlook in terms of our guidance for the year and towards that 20% top-line growth rate that we've been speaking about consistently.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Stan Berenshteyn from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe sticking with virtual primary care. Can you share what percent of new PlushCare members in the quarter joined as a result of those members seeking GLP-1-related care? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: And we haven't broken out membership by conditions that they are seeking. What we can tell you that we talked about in the past quarters is that a double-digit percentage of those business came from or were associated with GLP-1 or weight loss and that trend continued into this quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Robert Simmons from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nRobert Simmons: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So, can you talk a bit about what kind of a ramp and traction that you're seeing with virtual primary care and with taking Plush to the enterprise?\nRajeev Singh: Yes, absolutely. Happy to. I think it's one of the parts of the business that when we -- when we took Accolade Care or taking PlushCare to the enterprise as you put it, in last year, that we were most excited about the opportunity to go live with, call it 0.5 million people or so at the beginning of the year. What we're seeing and I'll give Dr. Nundy an opportunity to weigh in here as well. What we're seeing is, first that not only did we go live with that base, but that we saw the kind of utilization that we would expect on that base in the first seven, eight months since we've gone live. The second thing, we learned a lot. We learned a lot about incremental ways in which people were engaging with our solution, which has led us to really refine our value proposition associated with physicians being embedded in our advocacy care teams. And the reason for that, it should be used cases that customers and members are identifying through their usage that we're really excited about. Shantanu, would you like to add a little bit more color there?\nShantanu Nundy: Yes, absolutely. And it's a great question. Yes, I mean, just to give a couple of clinical examples of areas where, like Raj alluded to, I mean I think we anticipated -- we know that 20%, 30% of Americans don't have primary care physicians and we -- that our solution, because we're delivering primary care virtually, comprehensively would be a great option for them. I think some of the learnings beyond that was, we started seeing members who have primary care physicians, but just weren't able to access them or weren't able to get sort of, the solutions from those primary care physicians come to us. So, one example is, patients being discharged from the hospital. You know, it's very well studied that patients get better outcomes if they see their PCP within 48 hours of discharge from the hospital. But because of the access issues, a lot of times people weren't able to see their doctors in that shorter period of time. And so, our physicians were able to see those members right in that critical moment and I think resulting in downstream reductions and things like readmissions. A second example is, pretty commonly, members can get in to see their physicians around a time where they need to refill. And we're finding that that's an opportunity to actually talk to those members about the chronic conditions that they're getting the results for, and inform them about some of the trusted partners that we have that can also help complement sort of the pharmacologic option. So, just some examples of where we're able to drive value for employers in sort of those moments of need and really lean into that physician-led advocacy approach.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Jack Wallace from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nJack Wallace: Hey, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the beat. Speaking of the beat, you beat by more than the $2 million pull-forward, but you kept the full year guidance. I'm just wondering if you could help us think about the kind of the buckets of where the -- you can end up in the higher end of the range or the lower end of the range just thinking of whether it's the performance guarantees, new wins, or even some of the utilization fees and those assumptions in the back half of the year? And on that point, just how much of that might be a swing factor related to the GLP-1 space? Thank you.\nSteve Barnes: Hey, Jack, it's Steve. So, you're right, we beat the range by a little bit more than the performance guarantee. We -- you remember, just walking you back a quarter ago, we raised guidance last quarter. We're reaffirming that guidance as we're here moving through selling season and driving growth across the business. As we head into the back half of the year, certainly the variables on the business are around the items you talked about, the virtual primary care utilization, and EMO utilization, and PGs. We factor into our guidance historical performance and what we're seeing this year as well into the guidance and have good confidence in that number and we'll certainly report back on how we progress there. But important point here is that we raised guidance last quarter and we're reaffirming that today.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of John Penny from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nJohn Penny: Hi. John Penny on for Richard Close. Congrats on the quarter. I guess going back to virtual primary care, is that 20%, 21%, that you're calling for in guidance, is that like consistent across commercial and consumer? Is like commercial kind of coming off a smaller base, is going to be bigger? Or any color around that would be great. Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Sure. So, first of all, the 20%, 21% growth rate, so that's for the entire business. The way to think about that is that we've got the three different offerings that are driving growth in the business. The advocacy business itself is -- will be in the neighborhood of 20%. Virtual primary care business growing faster than 20%. And the enterprise primary care business will be growing quite a bit faster than that, but it's off of a small base, because we're in our first year there. So when you take that together with the consumer business, you put those together, it's growing faster than that, call it mid-20%s and then expert medical opinion offering growing in the neighborhood of 20%. So all of that together gets you to that about 20% to 21% growth for this year, with the virtual primary care business growing a bit faster than that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Ryan MacDonald from Needham and Company. Your line is open.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe just to touch on the T-5 contract, you mentioned that you're still awaiting decision on the Health Net appeal here, but given that the Congressional Research Service had provided an updated timeline now, does that give you any increased confidence on that we're sort of nearing a conclusion where you're actually going to get a final decision on the appeal and that we can start moving forward with this process? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Ryan, there's one thing certain, we know this can't last forever. We expect -- we expect to see a conclusion to the appeals process in what I would expect to be a reasonable time frame, call it over the course of the next three to six months. As the government has proven over the course of the last few year, it's difficult to bank on those timelines, even though there is expressions of a desire to get to the end of the appeals process, but we'd agree, we'd expect over the course of the next six months or so that we're going to get to some sort of conclusion. And that at that point, we're going to be in a place where we're well positioned to grow our business within the government.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rajeev Singh for any closing remarks.\nRajeev Singh: I appreciate everyone being here. Thanks for the time and we look forward to talking with you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accolade First Quarter '24 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Todd Friedman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nTodd Friedman: Thanks, operator. Welcome everyone to our fiscal first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Rajeev Singh; and our Chief Financial Officer, Steve Barnes. Shantanu Nundy, our Chief Health Officer, will join for the question-and-answer portion of the call later. Before turning the call over to Rajeev, please note that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating Accolade's performance. Details on the relationship between these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and the reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website. Also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results for Accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied in this call. For additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the SEC, all of which are available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Rajeev Singh.\nRajeev Singh: Thank you, Todd, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We entered fiscal Q2 with optimism regarding our company, our category and our opportunity to build a nationwide customer-obsessed healthcare delivery system of the foundation of advocacy-led primary care. Let's get into the reasons for our excitement. First, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both ahead of our guidance for fiscal Q1. Revenue in the quarter was $93.2 million with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $12.6 million, both ahead of our previous guidance and leaving Accolade in solid financial position to start the year. Revenue highlights in the quarter were marked by continued strength in our virtual primary care and mental health offerings, both consumer and enterprise. Strong growth in our expert medical opinion segment and some early recognition of performance-based revenues. We are increasing guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA this quarter. Both our growth engine and our path to profitability are firing on all cylinders. Steve will give you all the details in his prepared remarks shortly. Second, the selling season is off to a strong start. Fiscal Q1 is really the first quarter our buyers put pen to paper on contracts, and we saw large companies and foodservices and retail choose Accolade. Fiscal Q2 is also a major quarter for signing new business, and the pipeline continues to look strong. Notably, more of the deals in the pipeline include multiple offerings and one or more trusted partner solutions. We view this as powerful validation of our overall vision as well as the importance of embracing the ecosystem. This is reflective of continued interest in our category and our ability to win more than our fair share of the market with our differentiated personalized healthcare suite. From our foundation of advocacy, we're making advocacy-led primary care a critical factor for companies evaluating in our category. Third, calling out two other drivers of growth for our business. As I mentioned earlier, both our expert medical opinion business, Accolade Expert MD, and our virtual primary care and mental health business, Accolade Care and PlushCare, are demonstrating strength. Today, we'll focus on the virtual primary care business. On the enterprise side of the business, we fully deployed all of our new business sales from last fiscal year on January 1, 2023 and those customers are ramping up adoption of primary care and mental health services according to our expectations. Given that it's our first year of deployments, achieving our usage expectations in the first quarter is notable. On the consumer side of the business, we continued to see strong demand for the high-quality longitudinal care delivered by our physicians and therapists and growth rates remained strong and steady. Since I'm sure, we'll get a question about the impact of GLP-1 drugs, let me make a few comments here. Accolade's approach is different than many other companies in this space. That said, we did see a benefit from interest in these treatment options, and our primary care business is benefiting from the demand associated with GLP-1 weight loss drugs. I call this out for two reasons, to bring your attention to how Accolade differs from other companies who have a role or a part to play in this healthcare journey. While it is a fact that GLP-1 drugs are driving interest and virtual primary care. This is in many ways no different than when COVID drove demand for virtual primary care or during flu seasons. What is important is how we apply the same clinical focus and rigor, balanced customer acquisition and physician resources and maintain our obsession with the customer experience that has resulted in NPS scores over 90 for our virtual primary care services. Our care delivery teams led by Dr. Shantanu Nundy and Dr. James Wantuck are ensuring that we apply the proper clinical rigor in prescribing these drugs only to patients who meet the defined criteria and for prescription. We don't earn money for prescribing medications. So there are no incentives driving behavior to the contrary. Additionally, because of the nature of our service, we have the ability to help the patient with other needs such as behavioral health and ultimately lifestyle change that might be required when no longer taking the drug. Thus, much like patients who engage with us during the COVID lockdown, we expect to retain many of these customers on our platform long-term. Final point on this topic, the robust nature of our suite of offerings here make us unique in the market. For example, while not everyone qualifies for these medications, partners like Virta may be a strong alternative for our customers and members seeking to address their needs. Moving on, fourth, our government business continues to grow on the strength of our Autism Care Demonstration and other opportunities we are pursuing. As we have said previously, the T5 award remains in a protest phase with the decision on Health Net's protest now due in September. The official launch date has been pushed to August 2024, but that still remains subject to the protest timing. We continue to work with our T5 partners and look forward to planning our rollout and updating you on timing once that protest is complete. Fifth, our trusted partner ecosystem, a vital element of the value proposition for our customers continues to grow. Our customers benefit buyers are overwhelmed by the number of solutions available to them in the market. Our trusted partner ecosystem solves that problem by vetting critical partners in core categories. Last quarter, we added Equip, a leader in delivering eating disorder treatments. We'll continue to add new partners in a highly curated way and leverage our technology and data platforms to ensure strong adoption and efficacy for those programs. Finally, in terms of quarterly highlights, we made tremendous progress on our One Accolade initiative. This is already having the effect of streamlining decision-making in Accolade and improving our operating structure as we scale to serve hundreds more customers and millions more members. Now, wrapping up before I turn the call over to Steve, let's briefly take a giant step backward and look at our opportunity. Our mission is rooted in the idea that every person should have the opportunity to live their healthiest life and that this opportunity should not be hindered by an overly complex and costly healthcare system that intimidates people instead of welcoming them. We are demonstrating through outcomes, engagement, and measurable ROI that an advocacy-led population health strategy, one we call personalized healthcare, is the key to transforming the U.S. healthcare system for our customers. To address that challenge, we're aspiring to build the first customer-obsessed nationwide delivery system in the United States. That is no small task, but the opportunity for the company that succeeds there is enormous. The heart of that business is an advocacy-led primary care practice that once again puts primary care in the center of delivering high quality care. Over the last 50 years, for a variety of reasons, primary care spend as a percentage of total healthcare spend and utilization has gone down, while specialty care and pharmacy costs have continued to skyrocket. Accolade's strategy of virtual primary care and mental health, built off of a foundation of simplicity, service and data, delivered by our advocacy service, is a scalable means of reversing that trend. And our clients and prospects are agreeing and voting with their dollars. The market opportunity for doing this successfully is enormous. Our ability to influence many different parts of the healthcare journey has many significant vectors. Advocacy by itself is a $25 billion market. Expert medical opinion is similarly sized. Primary care is a $200 billion-plus market and our immediately addressable piece is north of $100 billion. Mental health is a large and growing market. The federal government represents a huge opportunity. And the capacity to enable dozens of ecosystem partners is also extraordinary. Today, fewer than 1,000 companies have adopted true advocacy-led benefits programs. There are over 35,000 companies with more than 500 employees who would consider our target market. Put it all together and we see a runway for years to come with the real beneficiary being the healthcare consumer. We encourage all of you to review our proxy statement filed this week, which goes into more detail on our strategy and our vision. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Steve to review our financials. Steve?\nSteve Barnes: Thanks, Raj. First, I'll recap the results for the first fiscal quarter and then provide details on the rest of fiscal 2024. We generated $93.2 million in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '24, representing 9% growth year-over-year or 19% pro forma growth, excluding the impact of a large customer termination in fiscal '23. Revenue highlights in the first quarter included strong growth in our primary care and expert medical opinion offerings, each of which grew in the range of 30% on a year-over-year basis. In Q1, we also recognized approximately $1 million in performance guarantee-related revenue earlier than expected, as we had initially forecasted this PG to be earned in fiscal Q4. As we've noted previously and highlighted in our Capital Markets Day presentation on May 8, at the start of a fiscal year, we generally forecast that savings-related PGs will be recognized in our fiscal Q4. When we earned those PGs earlier, we call them out to the extent they are notable. Fiscal Q1 adjusted gross margin was 43.5% compared to 45.6% in the prior year period. The primary factor impacting the year-over-year comparison was high gross margin performance guarantee revenue, recognized in Q1 of last year. Net of that PG timing impact, technology-driven efficiencies, as well as prudent spend management contributed to gross margin performance. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was a loss of $12.6 million. The positive performance versus guidance reflects the revenue overperformance, as well as a keen focus on spend management as we continue on our path to profitability. Note that fiscal Q1 reflects some duplicative costs as we transition and consolidate roles in certain of our office locations. This dynamic will continue into fiscal second quarter, with savings from the cost actions we announced on February 28 being fully realized in the second half of the fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents totaled $303 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter. As a reminder, our convertible notes are not due for about three years. So with $303 million cash on hand, we have more than adequate liquidity to achieve our financial plans without going back to the capital markets, placing us in a strong position to execute against our objectives. Finally, we currently have approximately 75.6 million shares of common stock outstanding. Now, turning to guidance. We're updating our guidance today for fiscal year 2024. Given the strong performance in fiscal Q1 and our optimistic outlook on growth, as well as our continued drive towards profitability, we are raising fiscal 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $410 million to $414 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 21% at the midpoint, excluding the customer termination noted earlier. We are also raising our full year outlook on our bottom line, updating our adjusted EBITDA loss for fiscal '24 to a range of $6 million to $12 million. And with respect to the fiscal second quarter, we are now guiding to revenue in the range of $93 million to $95 million and adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $11 million to $14 million. This adjusted EBITDA guide puts you at roughly negative $25 million for the first half of the year, which, when combined with our annual guidance, shows that we expect to be significantly positive on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the second half of the year as our cost initiatives become fully realized and we turn the corner towards full year profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis in fiscal '25. And with that, we'll open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question - our first question comes from Ryan Daniels from Blair. Your line is now open.\nRyan Daniels: Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a big picture one for you. We're seeing a lot of recent data that indicates that 2024 could be one of the larger healthcare cost trend increases for employers in about a decade. So, maybe a two-part here. Number one, do your early channel conversations lead you to believe this is being widely recognized in the market? And then number two, if so, is that really helping your advocacy-led PCP initiative as kind of a means to battle that trend at scale? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Hi, Ryan, thanks for the question and thanks for being here. I'll address the question and see if you've got anything you want to jump in on Q2. First part of the question, are we looking at a year ahead where a medical trend line is going to be significantly higher or materially higher than it has been in years past? I think that's very consistent with the feedback we're hearing, both from our customers, from the consultant community, and from the indexes, or the early view on the indexes for the year. And I think, the corollary to that, Ryan, is very true. Now, when companies are looking at increased cost, when companies are looking at significant changes in the landscape with things like GLP-1 or other material waves that are hitting the healthcare ecosystem in 2023 and 2024, they're looking for broad-based solutions that solve the problem at scale across the entirety of their population. And that's where we think we really differentiate ourselves. Primary care is a part of the story, but primary care builds off of an advocacy platform where you can surround primary care with data, service and simplicity. We think it's really differentiated, and that's no doubt playing a role in the growth of our pipeline on a quarter-for-quarter basis.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Raj, you spoke to some of the strength and expert medical opinion, and it does look like maybe there's some pent-up demand out there. Can you maybe just give a little bit more color in terms of some of the patterns that you're seeing and what that means for your outlook here?\nRajeev Singh: Yes, Craig, first of all, thanks for the question. I'm glad you're here. Two things that drive expert medical opinion revenues and growth. The first is new logo acquisition. Are we growing by acquiring new customers? And we do that both with our direct sales channel and with our outside partner channel. The answer to that question is yes. We're continuing to see strong growth there. The demand for a service like that one is so rationally aligned with the customer need continues to be strong. The second part of that story is utilization, and we're continuing to see utilization at levels that we've previously seen, and both of those things are driving the growth rate of the expert medical opinion business.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jeff Garrow from Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open.\nJeff Garrow: Yes. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, it sounds like I'm hearing an increased emphasis on virtual primary care as a differentiator. So, I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on that and also the mention of an increase in interest in more than one product at a time. So, relatedly there, curious to hear on any particular themes of combinations of products that prospects are interested in.\nRajeev Singh: Thanks for the question, Jeff. Let me start with the back end of your question. Last year, when you look at the deals we closed last year, and we had a strong bookings year last year, 30% growth off the year before, that year we saw the majority of new customer acquisition came in with more than one product. And so whether that was advocacy plus primary care, advocacy plus DMO, advocacy plus a trusted partner, we saw the majority of our deals come in with multiple products as part of the first sale. We think that's reflective of customers understanding the strategy, believing that a personalized health care suite is aligned with their needs, and also wanting to see a platform to weave all of those capabilities together. And so that trend continues into this year. And so, I think, I would guess over time that that just becomes the norm and that what we're looking at are customers who are looking for a suite of solutions to solve the litany of challenges that they're facing when they're trying to reduce health care costs and improve patient experience or member experience. First part of your question, Jeff, we would say that the way we've been thinking about our service from the beginning is that primary care on a platform of advocacy is fundamentally differentiated, particularly when you're talking about an advocacy platform that today is between 2.5 million and 3 million members. We have an extraordinary experience of delivering advocacy. We're now layering primary care on top of it. And what that really means is, every primary care physician that works at Accolade has a 360-degree view of the history of the patients that we're serving, has an understanding of the medications that are on and the conditions that they're facing, and also has an understanding of the benefits ecosystem that the employer has aligned for that patient. That gives our primary care physicians a superpower that other primary care physicians don't have. And so, a year ago, we really just got started in bringing primary care to market, the Accolade Care offering, and I think we were learning about how customers wanted to understand and embrace the solution. What we saw was a strong embrace of the solution last year. We deployed those customers on January 1. We're seeing great uptick in terms of their utilization. And I think it's fair to say, Jeff, that it's a more significant and pronounced part of our value proposition as we go to market today because we saw such traction in it last year.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jessica Tassan from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nJessica Tassan: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. We were just hoping you could remind us what the performance revenue in F1 Q '23 was, whether there was any in this quarter, and then just is that kind of what accounts for the year-over-year change in adjusted growth margin? Thanks.\nSteve Barnes: Hi, Jessica. It's Steve. Thanks for the question. Yes, there are certainly some performance guarantee impacts in Q1. Let me just walk you through. So, the guidance range for the quarter was $89 million to $91 million. So we beat the midpoint of the range by a little more than $3 million, and the top end of the range a little more than $2 million. There was about $1 million of performance guarantee pull forward recognized in Q1, that we expected to be recognized later in the year. So, we call that out. So the true beat was, call it $2 million -- $2.2 million at the midpoint, $1 million at the top of the range. If you look back to last year, you'd see that in this quarter last year, we had a fairly significant performance guarantee revenue item recognized in Q1 for a little more than $3 million. So, the year-over-year comp there is driving some of the change, or actually most of the change, in the gross margin. And the full year outlook for gross margin, we remain consistent with, call it, high 40s expectations for the year.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Alan in for Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. Raj, you mentioned, I guess, that investor, you talked a lot about the partnership strategy. And I think one of your partners, Virta, talked about how he was already driving some volume into their business. I guess, is there any way at this point in the year to quantify the referral momentum that you're seeing, or maybe total partners, how that's changed? And I guess, how important is the partnership strategy as you think about the 2025 selling season? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: I appreciate the question, Alan. I think whether you're talking about the 2024 selling season, the 2025 selling season, the partnership strategy is an essential part of the way we position our value to customers. Remember, if you were to step back, customers are looking to solve three core problems. The first, they want a better experience for their employees. They believe fundamentally that the existing healthcare ecosystem makes it difficult for people to understand and get the healthcare that they need. Second, as Ryan spoke about in his first question today, they're looking at trend lines that is beginning to have a very negative impact on their business and off of big, big numbers. They want to be able to control that trend line. And the third thing they're wrestling with is an extraordinarily complicated healthcare ecosystem with a whole suite of carve-out solutions that offer extraordinary innovation to their members, but their members have a very difficult time finding and the benefits buyers have a very difficult time managing. That third value proposition is fundamentally addressed by our trusted partner ecosystem and our capacity to go to markets with a vetted set of partners where we build real product integration and we have an opportunity to help manage those partners on behalf of our customers. That's been essential to the value proposition forever. And what we've seen now is that as the ecosystem has grown and the integrations have delivered more depth, we're driving the kinds of results that, as you mentioned, Sami Inkinen spoke about at Investor Day, right, 2x utilization at Accolade customers versus non-Accolade customers. That value proposition is so clean and so crisp for customers that it impacts buying behaviors. And so, in terms of quantification, I'd say, there's a couple of ways to look at it today that we speak about. First is the breadth of the relationships. If you're going to look across all the categories that our customers are looking at, I think you'll find that our ecosystem is broader and has more depth in the categories that matter to those customers than any other ecosystem in the space. The second part of that story is customer uptake and we've been talking over the course of the last couple of years about the fact that we're seeing an increasing majority of customers who have taken at least one trusted partner ecosystem relationship. Those two things should give you some sense, Alan, that this is right at the heart of the value proposition we deliver to our customers.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Stephanie Davis from SVB Securities. Your line is now open.\nStephanie Davis: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to also touch on that trusted partner ecosystem. Is this something where there's exclusivity with these partners? So there's some sort of head-to-head competition as you try to go and get them in your network versus that of another peers? Or is this something where it's more of a question of breadth and having kind of the widest possible bench for folks that might want some variance in who they're partnering with?\nRajeev Singh: Thanks for the question, Stephanie. I think it's actually neither of those. And so, let me start with the question of exclusivity. In fact, our partners, we partner with multiple companies in certain categories and we would expect to continue to partner with multiple companies in certain categories. The rationale for that is fundamentally around ensuring that our customers have the right choice. It also breeds competition and innovation in each of those categories, which we think is good for the universe, good for our members, good for our customers. And your opportunity to build differentiation with those partners, which could be exclusive if your differentiation and your investment in building integration with those partners is real, is where we think we have the opportunity to differentiate ourselves from potential competitors in the category who also have partnership, but also give our customers incremental value. So, hopefully that addresses the exclusivity point. On the second point, as it relates to breadth of the service, we're going to be very focused on categories that our customers care about, categories where they're spending money, categories where clinical outcomes can be improved and that we think can tangibly have hard impacts on trend lines. And in those categories, we're going to go deep. But I think what's important in terms of our strategy is, we're going to vet those partners. We won't choose a multitude of partners. We'll choose a couple, two, maybe top end three, that we believe are at the high end of that category in terms of value delivery, at the high end of that category in terms of accountability, and also around what our customers are most interested in. So we won't go wide necessarily that we have to. We'll be focused on the categories that matter and being really smart about the companies that we vet.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham and Company. Your line is now open.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi, congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Raj, you talked about, in the prepared remarks, the government business continues to grow nicely there with areas like the initiatives in Autism Care, but obviously, you've got some delays on the T5 contract. As we think about the growth opportunity in government over the next couple of years here, what do you expect the primary drivers to be? And are you dependent on success with T5 to be able to continue to grow that government vertical?\nRajeev Singh: Thanks for the question Ryan, I will hit in a couple of different ways. First Autism Care continued to be a - an exciting part of the business. It grew modestly on a year-over-year basis. We expect it to continue to grow and we have an opportunity to continue to grow that and it will be an important part of our government business moving forward. In terms of opportunities to grow beyond that, there are multiple incremental evaluations happening inside the government that will continue to pursue, they will range from the TRICARE universe to other parts of the government universe that - because we're still in the depths of those conversations, we haven't really talked about publicly, and we will, but then of course is the T5 relationship. We believe the T5 relationship presents significant opportunity as we've talked about that now given the fact, unfortunately, the government field process tends to delay things. And so, it's now at least at this point delayed till August of '24, it could potentially delay beyond that, we don't know. But what we can say is between Autism Care, between our other pursuits in the government, we can grow without the T5 arrangement. But with the T5 arrangement, we think there is a very real opportunity to show strong growth across the categories.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for your next question. And our next question comes from Jonathan Yong from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Yong: Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter here. Just on the pipeline commentary, it sounds like things are tracking well. But I guess, can you provide any color on how it's developing against your internal expectations? Is the pipeline larger than last year and alongside that it sounds like you're selling more or there's more interest in multi-product solutions? So I guess can you give any additional color on that? And what are people looking for which I think you talked about before? But just give a little more color there. Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Hi, Jonathan. Pipeline is bigger than it was last year at this time. Pipeline continues to grow. I wouldn't say beyond our expectations because our expectations are always aggressive but the pipeline continues to grow in a way that will support the objectives we have for the company for the year. As it relates to multiproduct deals last year, the majority of our deals were multi-product deals. And that same phenomenon is - we're quite confident Q1 witnessed the same phenomenon. We are quite confident that that same thing will happen in Q2 through Q4 and because of the breadth of our trusted partner ecosystem and because of the breadth of our solutions, advocacy, primary care and mental health and expert medical opinion, that desire of customers to do - to one stop shop across a number of categories, we think differentiates us against a number of our competition.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jailendra Singh from Truist Securities.\nJailendra Singh: It's a good try. This is Jailendra Singh from Truist Securities. Congrats on a good quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. One of your competitors recently announced partnership with in-home care provider to add virtual to in-home care model to its offerings. I was just curious on your thoughts on extending your offerings to home, and have you seen any demand in this area among your employer clients?\nRajeev Singh: Thanks Jailendra. I have a couple of thoughts here. First, you'll see us continue to expand our partner ecosystem into new category. We announced today partnership that we're really excited about, company called Equip that's focused on really improving service for people, families, challenged by eating disorders. If you look across the breadth of the category that we're delivering, we're delivering the widest solutions to customers in categories that are directly relevant to and as I mentioned before improving clinical outcomes, improving convenience for their members and lowering costs. Do we believe over time that home health is an area that could potentially have an impact in those three categories? Absolutely we do and please stay tune in terms of whether - for us, it's always about finding the right partner checking those three boxes and ensuring that is aligned with our customer's expectations.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Sandy Draper from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much and I appreciate you taking the question. I am trying to see if I can frame this right, probably for you, Steve. With the EBITDA outperformance this quarter, improving guidance in EBITDA, lower EBITDA losses, are you seeing - as you go through the year looking beyond that, do you change the way you think about, okay, maybe we step back up some reinvestments in sales and marketing, R&D or maybe we go back into the M&A market? Or is it really, you know what, we just want to scale margins and prove to ourselves and prove to the market, we can get closer and closer to those EBITDA targets you set as investors. I'm just trying to think with a strong start to the year, you're not going to make a snap decision, but if this type of performance continues by the end of the year, do you start to think about changing either M&A or internal investments? Or is it really just - let's just ramp faster in terms of margins, hopefully that makes sense. Thanks.\nSteve Barnes: Yes. Makes great sense. Thanks Sandy. This is Steve. So a couple of things. First of all, you're right, we had a strong quarter in Q1, we bottom lined by about $4 million and you'll see us raising our guidance for the full year for most of that, call it three and the other $1 billion you could consider that to be timing of investments in things like marketing programs, et cetera. But, look, we're very focused on getting the company to profitability as we laid out Capital Markets Day and by the second half of this year, we will be better and on a full-year basis in fiscal 2025. So that's a very important operational and strategic initiative for us. We also believe Sandy for other reasons Raj has laid out, given the strength we're seeing in the business and the strength of the platform and being diversified across advocacy, primary care, expert medical opinion, the partner ecosystem, there's a lot of ways for us to grow and we believe we're investing amply to achieve the growth targets we've laid out while also driving the company to profitability as we laid out in a lot of detail on Investor Day. So that's a little bit more color around the EBITDA guidance and how it ties into our balance of growth and profitability.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Richard Close from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [John Penney] on for Richard Close. Congrats on the quarter. I was just hoping you give some commentary on the virtual blue plan and how that's progressing or any commentary you can provide there would be great. Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Yes. I appreciate the question. The partnership continues to progress as expected, we've got the first round of going to market in that space. We've seen the first green shoots customer acquisition and utilization and so I'd say, the good news is we have the relationship in hand, the good news is we actually deployed and delivered and it's a little bit too early for us to give you any color commentary on the kind of utilization that we're seeing. But I can tell you that we continue to be really excited about the relationship and the opportunity in that space.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Stan Berenshteyn of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe on PlushCare. What percentage of the incremental growth expected to come this year, will be coming from the Enterprise channel? And can you also maybe comment on customer acquisition costs on the consumer side? Thanks.\nRajeev Singh: Sure. Sure. Steve, you want to get this one?\nSteve Barnes: I'll start, then you will jump in. So first of all, Stan thank you for the question as the growth coming today that you're seeing in revenue is largely driven by the consumer business. But importantly, we just launched several customers at more than half million members on the enterprise side of the platform. So that was on January 1 where most of those launched, so it's early days, but we're seeing strong utilization in line with our expectations here in that first quarter. So most of the near-term growth has been on the consumer side, but our expectations are that will also - we'll see significant contributions from the enterprise side. With respect to customer acquisition costs, I would say without getting specific about the dollar amount, we've seen it to be consistently attractive in the same range that we've seen over the past period of time, call past 12 months and so there's been a lot of opportunities to capitalize on that.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from David Larsen from BTIG. Your line is now open.\nDavid Larsen: Hi, congrats on the good quarter. You clearly have a very robust solution that's very comprehensive and impacts trend and improve the quality of care. One of the things that we've heard though is that when a customer decides to implement or potentially decides to implement Accolade, it can be a heavy lift, but you got to switch call centers from the carrier, sometimes they have to switch TPAs and because of that, sometimes they may delay or not choose to implement Accolade, just what are your thoughts around that? Do you ever get pushed back from that or not? Thanks. Appreciate it.\nRajeev Singh: Thanks for the question David. There's the way to think about it. If you were to look at the growth of the category, look at the growth of our customer base, our company has 54 customers on July 3, 2021 - 2020 when we went public. Last time we talked about our customer count, here we are in 2023 and we have more than 800 customers. When we think about bookings growth from fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023, our bookings grew by 30%, we're looking at a strong year ahead and we had a very strong Q1, as it relates to bookings. So when we look at customer adoption of a brand new category, we talk about healthcare services. I don't know that there's a category in the enterprise segment where we're going directly to employers and health plans that's growing more aggressively at this scale at this size. When you think about our revenue forecast for the year, we just took top-line our guidance from $410 million to $414 million from a range perspective, each of those representing strength of the business, the strength of the business is always a fundamentally driven by growth as it relates to new customer acquisition. So hopefully that answers your question Dave.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Robert Simmons from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nRobert Simmons: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could put a finer point on your commentary around new sales or new bookings this quarter being strong, like how much did they actually grow and what are your expectations for the year?\nSteve Barnes: Thanks for the question. We don't traditionally talk about bookings numbers in the - at the outset of the year, we've talked about consistent growth on bookings on a year-over-year basis last year even outperforming our expectations growing at 30%. We expect bookings to grow in that 20% to 25% range on a year-over-year basis and that's the way we're thinking about the year ahead. And so, we'll give you more color commentary on that at the end of the year. But what we can tell you, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks and in several questions, we're tracking to our expectations with a stronger pipeline than we have seen in the past.\nOperator: And thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Friedman for closing remarks.\nTodd Friedman: Thanks everyone for being here. Raj, we appreciate you spending the time with us and we look forward to future conversations.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
