I will now turn the call over to Rick Wayne. Mr. Wayne, you may begin.\nRick Wayne: Thank you very much. Good morning to those of you listening to the call. This morning, I want to go over a few of the interesting and important results during the quarter, and I'm not going to go over line by line what's already in the earnings release because I'm sure that you have read that or that you will read that. But I just want to spend a little bit on Page 3 of the slides. First, talking about the loan volume in the quarter. The purchased loans activity of $186.1 million invested on $208 million of UPB or 89.5% purchase price is our second strongest purchase quarter only behind the approximate $1 billion of loans purchased one year ago, so very, very strong. And on that topic, on the purchase loan market, we’re seeing a fair amount of good, very good supply in the marketplace and so we're looking at a lot. I would caution you that they are binary, you bid and you win or you don't win, but there seems to be a fair amount of supply in the marketplace. On the origination slide perspective, we originated $63.5 million of loans, which is, it's not that it's a bad number, but it's kind of a loan number consistent with the trend over the prior quarters. I can say that as we sit here today, the origination volume is picking up and I would expect that we will have higher numbers in the current quarter than we had in the quarter that ended December 31. The weighted average rate on our entire loan portfolio, originated loan portfolio was 9.45%, which is very strong. And then just to take a look at some of the quick stats, our net income was $14.1 million. And that was after we charged off $957,000, about almost a $1 million of a deferred tax asset due to changes in the way Massachusetts sets out their – or will set out their apportionment factor. So the income was very strong and the EPS was $1.85, return on equity was 17.35%, return on assets was 1.93% and tangible book value has grown to just a few pennies under $42 at $41.97. If we go now to Slide 8, which I am going to, I want to make a few comments on asset quality. First, you can see that there was a jump in nonperforming loans in the quarter that just ended from the previous quarter. That's principally due to three loans that went on non-accrual in the quarter. Kind of the headline is we don't think that we're going to have on those. And do we think they'll be resolved without any principal loss? A couple of them were kind of typical purchase loans or typical loans in national lending where they go late and then we resolve them, plenty of collateral coverage. And the first one for about $6 million is a dispute over lien position, our mortgage and others. And it's in the courts and in the event that we were to lose that, we have title insurance. That's why I say I don't expect to have any principal loss from these loans that are now are non-accrual. I also want to bring your attention to the bottom right corner of Page 8, where we take a look at net charge-offs. CECL has caused us to – has required that we change the treatment of purchased loans, which has an impact on how we report charge-offs. And I think the best way to make this point is to give you an example. Given a pool of loans, let us say, there was a loan that had a $50,000 customer balance, but when we bid for the loan along with a bunch of other loans, we allocated $0 to it. We got the loan, but we didn't pay anything for it. Under pre-CECL, we would just carry that loan at zero because we didn't pay anything for it. But in the case of CECL, you're now required to carry that loan, show the loan at $50,000 with a corresponding allowance of $50,000. So it nets to zero. And at some point, if we charge-off that loan, then it shows that $50,000 would show as a charge-off, even though we didn't have any principal allocated to that. So keeping in mind, those new rules under CECL, you'll see that. And there's a footnote on this. In the case of quarters ending September 30 and also on December 31, out of the 0.7% of 930 or 7 basis points, 6 basis points of that was a number attributable to CECL, which as I described, there was no loss of principal. It's just the way you have to report it for accounting.  So there was only one basis of charge offs in September 30. And for December 31, the same point that we're showing 11 basis points here or 0.11%, but out of that 11 basis points, 9 basis points are as a result of CECL, where there was really no loss of principal. So if you strip that out from those two numbers, the charge offs for the quarter ending September 30 was 1 basis point, and on December 31 was two basis points, not much at all. That's way in the weeds, but because it's a change, I just wanted to try and explain that for you. If we now move on to Slide 9, this is a slide that shows the change in the non-performing loans from September 30 to December 30 – I mean, from September 30, 2023 to – September 30, 2023, part, sorry for that, to December 31, 2023. And you can see, it's gone up from 17 point around here, $5 million to $30.7 million. And most of that are the three loans designated one, two, and three, which I spoke about just a couple of minutes ago. And then there's another one on designated as number four for $1.1 million, which subsequent to quarter end was paid off in full, which is my expectation for the other ones as well. I do want to comment on page – on the deposit on interest rates starting on Page 15. And you can see that for the quarter, our quarterly cost of deposits was 4.16% and continuing the upward march of rates and the spot rate on the last day of the quarter was 4.23%. The good news around our funding is we're starting to see our cost coming down. And we have, for example, $700 million brokered CDs maturing over the next six months, which at today's rates, we could replace at a 40 basis point savings, which is quite substantial. And I also want to highlight on Page 16, that looking at what's happened by channel in our deposits over the last year and the main point I want to make is that in our banking centers, we have seven that our deposits in those banking centers have gone up by $216 million. We're 38% from a year ago, which we're really happy about. And we're continuing to build those core deposits in our branches as a way of replacing higher cost deposits and other categories. Finally, I do want to comment on the expenses on Page 19 that have gone up from the linked quarter about $300,000. It's mostly in the compensation line. In December, we gave every employee in the bank, I would say, other than Pat and me, $1,000 each for the year – end of the year was about $200,000, well deserved by our great team and built morale, increased morale. Everyone was excited about that. And then also in this quarter, we had a full quarter of stock compensation, we make stock grants typically in August. And so for the preceding quarter, it was only half a quarter that was recorded of that expense. And in the current – the quarter ending December 31, it was a full quarter. So that's about $400,000 of the difference. And then we had some savings in some other areas. And I do want to say, before we turn it over to any questions that if they – this is in some ways it's a bittersweet day for us, it's sweet because we had another really great quarter. It's bitter because JP is some who many of you have talked to, I know and like and respected, is leaving our bank to take a position at another bank after being with us six years. He will be missed by everyone. He's really built a great group. We have the privilege of working with him day in and day out. He's really a first rate person. He's a good father and a good husband. His colleagues like and respect him and the quality of his work is extraordinary. And so we will miss him. But he will be part of our Alumni club and we will all get to see him a lot, I hope. And so today is his last day. He’s been totally professional. He gave notice maybe six weeks ago or seven weeks ago and has worked diligently every single day. And so we all wish him every success. I don’t have to say the best of luck. He doesn’t need luck. He will be successful, but he will be missed. And on that note, we’d like to turn it over and see if there are any questions at all.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Twerdahl with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nAlex Twerdahl: Good morning.\nRick Wayne: Good morning, Alex.\nAlex Twerdahl: First off, Rick, you said in your prepared remarks that you’re seeing a fair amount of good supply in the marketplace for purchases, which seems like an optimistic statement. However, I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more context and a little bit more color around what you’re really seeing and maybe compare it to what you had seen over the last couple of quarters.\nRick Wayne: Well, the last quarter was also a strong quarter, a good quarter for purchases, not like this quarter. This was a much better one. We’re seeing loans coming to market from banks for reasons, some having to do with sales that I don’t want to be too specific here, but started with some of the banks have failed in last year that some of those assets have been now coming to the market to be traded. It’s public information that the Signature assets were sold and bought by a few different groups. We’re seeing banks selling who want to shed some commercial real estate assets and that’s not unusual. We tend to see that. I’d say we’re maybe starting to see with some banks are a little bit smaller selling loans as well. I don’t mean small banks, not the national banks. And we’re seeing the kind of assets that we tend to like in this market, which are low LTV where a lot of the discount is driven by interest rates. So if rates come down again, they will – while we’re getting them just because the interest rate discount and at good prices. But secondly, there’s an opportunity for some upside in those if rates come down, so some of those folks can refinance more easily. Pat, do you want to add anything to that in terms of the...\nPat Dignan: Yes, I think that’s a good summary. Last quarter and this quarter, M&A is always a factor, balance sheet repositioning and in some cases, funds who purchased mixed pools last year are trying to trade out of the higher-quality assets now because of the yields on those. Yes. So those are the big reasons. And we’re not really seeing much distress yet, except for the signature stuff. Yes.\nAlex Twerdahl: Yes. In terms of the pools that you look at, but then you don’t wind up buying. I know it’s obviously binary, you get it, you don’t. But when you’re losing those pools? Is it because the buyers just not like in the price and keeping it? Or is it because other – is there other competition out there that’s winning those?\nPat Dignan: I think – well, there’s always competition out there, and it’s always good to know that there’s a market and we’re not the only buyers so that we can gauge our own pricing. But I’d say that after that, the two big factors are that sellers are – sometimes find it hard to believe that performing loans would trade at that big of a discount and choose not to sell. And another factor is that in some cases, with loans that were underwritten at very, very low cap rates in the real estate, there’s a disagreement around value, and that’s also a factor.\nAlex Twerdahl: Got it. And then I’m just curious, a pretty big pullback in rates sort of in the middle section of the curve, in the middle of the fourth quarter, towards the end of the fourth quarter, how does that impact the sort of the sales process and pricing?\nRick Wayne: The same, Alex [ph], your question is because of rates declining in the fourth quarter. Does that impact the pricing of the loans, I guess.\nAlex Twerdahl: Yes, I mean, I would assume it has to impact the pricing, but I’m just curious if there’s – if that would be an obstacle to having stuff closed in the fourth quarter, just given that the rates are moving down and the volatility maybe is not the friend of the market, but I don’t know so I’m asking.\nRick Wayne: Yes. I don't think that in the fourth quarter, what we did that was such a big deal, the rate change in the fourth quarter, it would be longer if rates come down a lot, then you would expect that you would be buying loans at a lower yield. But we haven't seen that impact yet.\nAlex Twerdahl: Yes. I mean, from the pricing, pricing is always a little bit hard to sort of draw real conclusions from because we don't really know what the underlying loans look like. But would it be fair to assume that the – sort of the full on return on the purchased portfolio, based on what you're purchasing, stays kind of within the range in which it has been in the last two quarters?\nRick Wayne: Well, we paid $0.895 this quarter for what we purchased. I think it's kind of typical from what we bought. It's kind of low LTV. Kind of what we – our expectation is on yields about the same as we have been in the past. There hasn't been a big. Overall on any given loan, you can buy something at a lower price and get paid off early and that can impact it. But looking kind of portfolio wise on what we purchased, I think it's pretty much as we have in the past. You may recall, of course, there's two components, of course, to what you earn. One is the rate on the note, and secondly, how much is the discount and when does the loan pay off? That's what ultimately generates the yield. And going back a lot of years, when we started this in 2010, at that very time, the FDIC from banks that had closed, we're selling loans at $0.80 and then directionally correct over the next, call it five, six years or something, we were buying loans between $0.82 and $0.87 or $0.88. And then for a period of time we were buying them at $0.92 or $0.93. And if you look back at the big purchases over the last year, the $1 billion was roughly at $0.87. And what we purchased in this quarter, which is the second largest quarter, was at $0.895.\nAlex Twerdahl: Okay, right. Switching gears to the originate portfolio, just – I think you mentioned that the pipelines have picked up a little bit heading into the first quarter. Is that – do you think that portfolio will stabilize? I mean, I know you're coming off of a couple of huge origination years, 2022 and you've seen a little bit more amortization maybe as a result of that. But how do you think about sort of the overall size of that portfolio and whether not production will be able to fully...\nRick Wayne: I think it will grow.\nAlex Twerdahl: It will grow?\nRick Wayne: I think it will grow. Over the last bunch of quarters, there was much less activity, there was less clarity on value, less deals being done. We're seeing that activity pick up. And during that time period, we saw a lot of things but we said no a lot, and we're seeing more now the kind of deals that we like to do and with a lot of volume coming in. And I expect that will grow our – and you may remember that before we had the big purchase a year ago, we were mostly an origination shop. So going back, I may say June 30, 2022 if I'm off by either dollars or when the year was, I apologize. But I think generally, we did like 550 [ph] of originations and $175 million of purchases, something like that, so that was 75% originations and 25% purchases, now kind of flipped. But I expect that – we're hopeful that the purchase numbers will continue to be meaningful and significant, but the origination numbers will pick up.\nAlex Twerdahl: Okay. That's helpful.\nRick Wayne: And again really good – I was just saying, we get really good pricing on our originations. It's kind of the same pricing we're getting on our purchase book.\nAlex Twerdahl: Yes. I mean maybe just kind of sticking on the pricing on the origination portfolio. I know a lot of it is Prime-based and you have floors in place. But maybe just given that the outlook for rates now is maybe Prime coming down at least several times this year, is there any other considerations that we have in the back of our mind with respect to the trajectory of the yield of that portfolio?\nRick Wayne: No, I think you said it in your preamble to that, which is they're either Prime – they're all floating, either Prime or SOFR. Most of the loans have floors and are usually set at the rate when the loan closes. But in some cases, the floor is less than that. So we have not 100% protection on our current rates, but a lot of protection on our current rates on that.\nAlex Twerdahl: Great. And then the final thing I wanted to ask about is that it looks like there was a pickup in the gain on sale of SBA loans, and I know that there are some initiatives kind of with SBA product. Is that higher level of gain on sales? Is that indicative of maybe a little bit more success in that product? Or maybe talk through what you're seeing and kind of expectations we should have from here?\nRick Wayne: It has picked up the volume for the quarter was about $14 million, which is a lot more than it was a year ago, and it's got the potential to continue to grow. And so that – and so therefore, there were – we're selling off always the guaranteed portion. And so therefore, the revenue has been going up. How much more, with this product even from the beginning, I was – and I am now very reluctant to make a prediction on volume or contribution to earnings from this product other than just reporting as it happens. So you saw the numbers on what the gain was. And then part of the sale of what we sold in the gain some was originated last quarter a bunch of it this quarter. And then at the end of December, we were holding on balance sheet, some of the guaranteed portion that we hadn't sold in the quarter but would have sold in January.\nAlex Twerdahl: Okay. \nRick Wayne: Sorry. That's not a great answer for you. I know, Alex, but I don't want to – I'm not trying to blink and say things are bad or good. I'm just saying it's a little bit hard to predict, and I don't want to go too far on a limp saying what that will be. \nAlex Twerdahl: Yes. We'll be happy to see the uptick in the quarters in which we see it. Thanks for taking my questions, JP best of luck in your future endeavors and that's it for me.\nRick Wayne: Thank you, Alex.\nJP Lapointe: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. Now I will turn the call back over to Rick Wayne for closing remarks.\nRick Wayne: Thank you. All of you that are listening and all of you that will listen when you go online to listen to this; I appreciate your support and look forward to talking again in April. Thank you. We're all set, operator. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

I will now turn the call over to Rick Wayne. Mr. Wayne, you may begin.\nRick Wayne: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Here with me are Pat Dignan, our Chief Operating Officer; and JP Lapointe, our Chief Financial Officer. I want to go over this morning some of the financial highlights, as well as talk about our loan activity and our asset quality. JP will then talk about the impact of CECL on the bank, which was adopted on July 1. And then all three of us are available, look forward to answering any of your questions. First, let me start by saying that the quarter was really an excellent one in so many ways. We earned $15 million or $2.01 earnings per share diluted with a return on equity of 19.73%, a return on assets of 2.12% and getting very close to $40 per share of tangible book value at $39.96. During the quarter, we purchased $130 million -- excuse me, we put on the balance sheet $130.3 million of loans, of which $68 million were originated with a weighted average rate of 9.27%, and we purchased loans with a UPB of $63.7 million at a price and invested dollars of $52.4 million, which is an 82% purchase price. Finally, our NIM for the quarter was 5.30%, really all -- we think outstanding results for the quarter. With respect to loan activity, on the originated side, we have seen our volume over the last five quarters declining. I might say, almost intentionally, we're being -- continue to be very selective on what we're willing to commit to, and loans that we may have done 1.5 years ago or so are loans that we're not necessarily going to do now, plus there are less transactions in the marketplace. But I don't want to diminish $68 million of volume, that's still a lot of volume for us. On the purchase side, really right size both in the quarter and in front of us while we closed on $63.7 million. I mentioned in our press release that we signed an agreement to acquire an additional $74 million of loans, which closed in the beginning of October. With respect to what we see in the marketplace, we see lots of opportunities. I would point out it's binary, you win and you don't win. So I don't want to overpromise. But it seems to be -- and from what we hear from others in the market, a time where there ought to be a fair amount of supply of the kind of loans that we'd like to bid on, that is to say, loans that are performing secured by cash flow and collateral located in reasonably liquid markets. And so we will see what happens in this quarter that we're in now in the following quarters, but we are optimistic about our opportunities to purchase loans in this environment. In terms of asset quality, and of course there's a lot in the news about commercial real estate, our portfolio continues to perform very well. Our non-performing, I would say, assets, but it's really non-performing loans since we don't have any already in our portfolio, at the end of September was $17.5 million, which includes a $2.3 million mark on CECL. So excluding that, our non-performing loans were down by about $500,000 and they represent 69 basis points, our non-performing loans over our total loans. And with that, I would ask JP to talk about CECL. JP?\nJP Lapointe: Thank you, Rick. On July 1 we adopted the CECL allowance for credit law standard. At June 30, our allowance amounted to $7.3 million. On July 1, when we adopted CECL, our allowance increased by $19.4 million to $26.7 million. The increase was a combination of $18.3 million of discount that was transferred from the carrying balance of purchased loans to the allowance for loan losses, and $1.2 million that was transferred from retained earnings, which amounted to $870,000 retained earnings impact net of taxes. At September 30, the allowance decreased to $25.3 million, and that decrease during the quarter was primarily due to charge-offs related to purchased loans that had been carried at zero. But after the CECL adoption, now had carrying balances and required the loan amount and the related reserves to be charged off. The allowance to total loans now sits at 1% and is more comparable to other institutions than what we had previously recorded in the reserves. Some of the changes that impact the bank's financials after the CECL adoption are: historically, some purchase loans had extensions modeled over into the projected cash flows, allowing the purchase discounts to be accreted over a period that extended beyond the contractual maturity. On the adoption of CECL, the accounting standards required at the purchase discounts are accreted over the contractual life of the loans and extensions are no longer modeled in, which has the impact of accretion being taken over a shorter period of time. This should also make interest income from purchase loans more consistent and may contribute less transactional income than we had historically recognized on its portfolio. While the bank has certainly had very low charge-offs, including zero charge-offs on the National Lending originated portfolio, under CECL purchases with credit marks are now reserved for in the allowance and then charged off through the allowance, which could give the appearance of increased charge-offs. However, many of these charge-offs, especially the ones during this quarter, were purchased loan discounts that previously offset the loan balances and have now moved into the allowance and did not impact the provision for credit losses. Additionally, as Rick indicated, upon the adoption of CECL, the bank transferred $18.3 million from the discount against the carrying balance of loans to the allowance. This had the impact of increasing the carrying balance of those loans. As you can see on slide nine, the adoption increased our non-performing loans by $2.3 million for the quarter by increasing the carrying balance and the related allowance for those loans. Absent CECL adoption, non-performing loans would have been approximately $500,000 less than the previous quarter. Thank you.\nRick Wayne: Excellent. Thank you, JP. And now we'll turn it back and see if there are any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Alex Twerdahl from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAlex Twerdahl: Hey, good morning, guys.\nRick Wayne: Good morning.\nJP Lapointe: Good morning, Alex.\nAlex Twerdahl: First off, Rick, you commented on seeing lots of opportunities in the purchase market and obviously binary, you either win or you don't. I was wondering if you could give us a little color on the ones you're not losing, if it's because the seller just decides to keep the product given the pricing or if the competition has changed in any way, or just a little bit more on, I guess, the competitive dynamics in the market as well.\nRick Wayne: The -- well, earlier in the year we were seeing sellers -- sometimes we have a pricing exercise. They're [Technical Difficulty] and ours were not close. We're seeing that get much closer now. And as you move towards the end of the calendar year, where sellers are more motivated to sell for various reasons, the obvious one is that their fiscal year is coming to an end, we're seeing more realistic expectations about pricing, and therefore, easier for us to buy loans than it had been previously. That's one point I would make. And the second one, I would make is that we are seeing more activity again on the kind of loans that we'd like to buy. And so -- and because, as I've mentioned in other calls, because rates are higher, in some cases, we're seeing less competition for that. Pat, do you want to add anything to that?\nPat Dignan: No, I think those are the two big highlights, the sellers that can't take a hit. And there's also a fair amount of disagreement on value that's still out there as some markets we target.\nAlex Twerdahl: Got it. And then a lot of us have been paying attention to the loans that the FDIC is currently selling, the commercial real estate loans. I was wondering if you had any further thoughts on whether or not that's something you guys would bid on. And I assume that when you're talking about the market trends, it's sort of irrespective of that pool of loans.\nRick Wayne: Well, I wouldn't be able to say whether we were bidding or not bidding on the large pool that the FDIC is selling. It's obviously a big pool with awfully large loans in it. But I don't think I could really comment on more than that. I'd like to, but I cannot.\nAlex Twerdahl: Got it. And then JP, just as we try to work through these -- the accounting shift from CECL into the model, specifically around how the purchase loans get accounted for, does it essentially just reclassify transactional income as regularly scheduled income? Or is it actually wind up pulling forward some of that transactional income, as well just because you can't recognize it over as long a period? And I guess, I think you commented in your prepared remarks that it should smooth out earnings, and I was just wanted to confirm that.\nJP Lapointe: Yes. So what it does is the transactional income really arrive at when a loan pays off. So given the fact that now we have to take these over the contractual life and not some level of modeled extension, there's a possibility that there's going to be less discount available when a loan pays off since we're taking it over a shorter life on some of those loans where we had modeled extensions previously. So it should kind of move it from what would have been available for more transactional income historically into more regularly scheduled accretion over the contractual life of those loans.\nRick Wayne: And therefore, it will smooth out. It's just smooth out of earnings.\nAlex Twerdahl: Got it. I was wondering if you can give us any thoughts on sort of where you think you are in terms of deposit cost pressures. It seems like the pace of increase in deposit cost is certainly slowing. If you had any sort of thoughts on where that might peak out, if we should expect betas to continue to move higher or what you're thinking there.\nJP Lapointe: Yes. I think mostly, we've caught up. I think we have a little bit of brokered CDs that are maturing towards the end of the quarter that we're in now. So I think once those reprice, we'll kind of be mostly at the peak for where we should be barring any future potential rate hikes depending on what the Fed decides to do moving forward. But I think it's definitely slowing down from where we were over the past year. And I think after next quarter, we should kind of be at the peak.\nAlex Twerdahl: Got it. And then just as we think through the right level of non-interest expenses, any help that you could provide? I think this quarter was a little bit impacted by stock-based compensation, if I'm not mistaken. If you could help us, sort of, figure out sort of the right run rate, I guess, over the next few quarters.\nRick Wayne: I think -- well, first, one point on the -- and additionally, you're right, it was a stock comp. But it was mostly because of the incentives, the equity that was granted at a higher stock price. There were some slight increase in the number of shares granted, but most of the increase was because the stock price was higher than when the previous ones were granted. But I think the number we have now, JP, we’re thinking that was about a good reasonable number for a run rate. Was there anything that you think unusual in this quarter, JP? Or is that a good number going forward?\nJP Lapointe: I think that's a pretty good number going forward. I don't think we expect too much one way or the other in the next couple of quarters.\nRick Wayne: And now, you know this, Alex. So to the benefit of our listeners that are loan book has increased by almost $1 billion since December ‘22. And so therefore, higher operating expenses are not shocking.\nAlex Twerdahl: Got it. And I guess just last question, back to the purchase market trends. Is it still safe to say that the bulk of what you're seeing is being driven by the change in interest rates? Or are you seeing anything that's being more -- coming to the market from a credit perspective?\nPat Dignan: I think there is the transactions that fit in our sweet spot are largely being driven by liquidity issues and M&A.\nAlex Twerdahl: Great. Thank you for taking all my question.\nRick Wayne: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick Wayne for closing remarks.\nRick Wayne: Thank you, and thank you those. Thank you, Alex, for your questions and others for listening in. And we look forward to another -- our next conversation, not for the weather in January, but to reading again to talk about our quarterly results. Thank you all and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
