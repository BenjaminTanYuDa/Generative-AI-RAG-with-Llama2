Joining me today from AeroVironment are Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wahid Nawabi; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Kevin McDonnell. We will now begin with remarks from Wahid Nawabi. Wahid?\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Jonah. Welcome, everyone, to our fiscal year 2024 third quarter earnings conference call. I will start by summarizing our performance and recent achievements, after which Kevin will review our financial results in detail. Next, I will provide information about our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. Kevin, Jonah, and I will then take your questions. I am pleased to report that our third quarter results were exceptional and we once again hit key milestones toward achieving our best year ever. Our key messages, which are also included on slide number three of our earnings presentation, are as follows: first, third quarter revenue rose to $187 million, setting a new third quarter record and significantly outperforming last year's same quarter results by nearly 40%; second, revenue for our Loitering Munition segment more than doubled year-over-year and achieved its highest quarterly revenue to date; third, this quarter's exceptional performance and high visibility gives us confidence to raise and tighten our fiscal year 2024 guidance ranges; and fourth, AeroVironment continues to be a leader in the defense tech space and remains well positioned for double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2025. Our strong top line growth in profitability created meaningful value for our shareholders, and we're very pleased with our performance to date. Our results were driven by increasing demand for our unmatched solutions and strong operational execution. Our backlog is up 12% from the same quarter last year, and we have leveraged this stable backlog to deliver more consistent quarterly performance. By level loading our factory's production throughout the year, we have achieved greater operational efficiencies, while expanding throughput. AeroVironment has demonstrated market leading manufacturing capacity for Unmanned Systems, and we continue to invest in facilities, people, and processes to prepare for even greater demand in the future. With both our customers and shareholders in mind, we continue to reinvest in innovative customer-driven solutions. We're targeting multiple $1 billion programs of record, as well as emerging unmanned solutions markets. We're also investing in upgrades to our current platforms so they remain well suited to evolving battlefield conditions. While our focus is primarily on internal development, we also remain active in seeking inorganic opportunities which would benefit our current product portfolio and further our success. We're proud to partner with our country and our allies by delivering the solutions they need to successfully carry out their vital missions, and we're confident that we will continue to deliver strong value to our stakeholders for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Now, let me provide an update on current developments across our three segments. I will begin with our Loitering Munition segment, or LMS, in which revenue for the third quarter more than doubled year-over-year to $58 million. Higher demand across the globe and emerging programs of record are driving historic top line growth. This was our best quarter ever for LMS, with a significant rise sequentially and year-over-year. Yet, we believe we're only getting started. As I mentioned last quarter, we're in active negotiations with the U.S. government on a large multiyear sole source IDIQ contract for Switchblade to meet increased demand for the U.S. and our allies. We're also engaged with more than 20 countries who have demonstrated a strong interest in Switchblade and of those, about a third continue to seek export authorization from the U.S. DoD. We're also optimistic about key programs of record in the pipeline. These include the U.S. Marine Corps solicitation for its Organic Precision Fires, or OPF program; the U.S. Army's Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance, or LASSO program; and the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit's Replicator initiative. We believe we're well positioned for these significant long-term opportunities. We look forward to sharing further updates on these programs later this calendar year. In addition to these standalone applications, we continue to see opportunities to integrate Switchblade into other platforms, such as helicopters through the U.S. Army's Long-Range Precision Munition, or LRPM program, and ground vehicles with the U.S. Army's Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, or OMFV program. We believe platform integrations will be a significant component of LMS revenues in future years. We expect Switchblade production to increase further in the fourth quarter, setting LMS up for another record fiscal year and even greater success in the future. Since we foresee additional large orders for Switchblade on the horizon, we're investing to further increase our manufacturing capacity. While we have sufficient capacity for the next couple of years of increased demand, our team is also evaluating future expansion of facilities, geographies, and supply chain partners. In summary, we remain very optimistic about the growth potential in this business segment. Moving to our Unmanned Systems segment, revenue for the quarter rose 23% year-over-year to approximately $113 million. Top line growth is broadly spread across our Puma and JUMP 20 systems, reflecting a good mix of domestic and international customers. While AeroVironment remains the defense tech leader in unmanned aircraft systems, the Puma, now in its third generation, is undeniably the industry gold standard for small UAS. In the last 12 months alone, we have shipped more than $400 million of this product to domestic and international customers. It is also important to mention that the third-generation Puma we're shipping today has significant technological upgrades compared to the original one. These enhancements include higher resolution cameras, greater autonomous navigation, resiliency in contested environments, longer endurance, and vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL operations, to name a few. We plan to continue these investments to keep the Puma system best-in-class. As an example, we're upgrading our software stack to include new machine learning enabled autonomy and computer vision image recognition features for this amazing product. In a similar manner, we're leveraging our most recent acquisition, Tomahawk Robotics, to bring open architecture common control systems to our full UAS portfolio. This business has now successfully transitioned into our Unmanned Systems segment, and we expect to integrate the Kinesis software platform with our UAS platforms later this year. I also want to address the U.S. Army's recent announcement that it plans to sunset the RQ-11 Raven, their workhorse small UAS, after more than 20 years of service. With approximately 20,000 units delivered, Raven is the most widely adopted military UAS in the world. We are extremely proud of the support Raven has provided to the U.S. Army and our soldiers. At the same time, we stand ready to compete for the next-generation small UAS on the U.S. Army's Medium-Range Reconnaissance, or MRR program, and the Long-Range Reconnaissance, or LRR program. Our Unmanned Systems segments continue to offer a strong, steady, and profitable revenue stream, and we remain optimistic about additional domestic and international orders in our pipeline. We also believe that our recent and future product enhancements for Puma 3 AE, JUMP 20, and Vapor 55 will drive enduring customer demand for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Moving to our MacCready Works segment. As expected, revenue was down slightly from third quarter fiscal year 2023. As we discussed last quarter, we're now realizing some program delays related to the continuing resolution in an associated reduction in customer funded R&D. As Kevin will discuss, we now expect to increase R&D spend in the fourth quarter in order to progress these programs, while we await funding approvals. That said, we continue to focus on many new and exciting opportunities which will rapidly shape this business's growth. We are maintaining our investments in [HAPS] (ph), contested logistics, maritime UAS and other exciting platforms and technologies. Many of these solutions require very advanced capabilities which AeroVironment is uniquely capable of providing. In fact, we recently won a $16 million US Navy contract for the advancement of video analytics and computer vision research to support multidomain robotics. This award leverages our development of shared software ecosystems that provide enhanced situational awareness on the battlefield. Under this multi-year effort, we will explore and implement new technology that optimizes how intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting are performed throughout the US DoD. Finally, I would like to note that our Ingenuity Mars Helicopter just wound down its mission after making its 72nd flight. Ingenuity's performance was nothing short of outstanding, exceeding all mission objectives and expectations. We're very proud of our work on this program and look forward to supporting future planetary exploration initiatives. In summary, MacCready Works is achieving its mission to incubate new product lines and develop vital capabilities, and we look forward to sharing exciting developments in future quarters. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin McDonald for a review of the quarterly financials. Kevin?\nKevin McDonnell: Thank you, Wahid. Today I will be reviewing the highlights of our third quarter performance, during which I will occasionally refer to both our press release and earnings presentation available on our website. Overall, we had another outstanding financial quarter as the third quarter finished strong in terms of revenue, adjusted gross margins, and adjusted EBITDA. We are on track to meet all our full-year objectives. As Wahid mentioned in his remarks, revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $186.6 million, an increase of 39% as compared to the $134.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Slide 5 of the earnings presentation provides a breakdown of revenue by segment for the quarter. Our largest segment during the quarter was unmanned systems, UMS, which is a combination of our small UAS, medium UAS, UGV, and recently acquired Tomahawk businesses. UMS had revenue of $113.3 million in the quarter, which is up 23% from last year's $92.3 million. Puma demand remained strong, accounting for about half the UMS revenue, but we also saw meaningful contributions from our JUMP 20 product, Tomahawk products, and ground vehicles during the quarter. Loitering Munitions or LMS, recorded revenue of $57.7 million, a 140% increase as compared to the $24 million last year during Q3. A little more than half of the LMS revenues came from the Switchblade 600 products and services, while the remainder is primarily from the Switchblade 300 products. Revenue from our MacCready Works segment came in at $15.6 million, a decrease of 13% as compared to the $18.1 million from the third quarter of last fiscal year. However, we had over 20% increase in non-HAPS revenue year-over-year, as we continue to see strong demand for our machine learning and autonomy capabilities. The MacCready Works segment's growth has been muted because of the delays in establishing a government year 2024 budget. In Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, there is a breakdown between product and service revenue. Specifically, during the third quarter, product revenue accounted for 84% of total revenues, an increase from 68% in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, primarily due to strong product revenue from both our small UAS and Loitering Munition Systems businesses. We expect product revenues as a percentage of revenue to remain above 80% for the foreseeable future. Moving to gross margins. Slide 6 of the earnings presentation shows the trend of adjusted product and service gross margins. While Slide 12 reconciles the GAAP gross margins to adjusted gross margins, which excludes intangible amortization expense and other non-cash purchase accounting items. In the third quarter, consolidated GAAP gross margins finished at 36%, up from 34% in the previous year. The improvement in GAAP gross margins was a result of improved product service mix and higher service gross margins, following the scaling down of our medium UAS COCO business in the comparable period last year. Third quarter adjusted gross margins reached 38%, marking an increase from the 36% recorded in the same period last year. The improvement was driven by the same factors as for GAAP gross margins. Adjusted product gross margins for the quarter were 38% versus 41% in the third quarter of last fiscal year, reflecting the increase of the Loitering Munition Systems product revenue in the overall mix this year. In terms of adjusted service gross margins, the third quarter was at 40% versus 27% during the same quarter last year. The high level of service margins was primarily a result of one-time -- a one-time favorable contract closeout and the impact of our new Tomahawk acquisition. We expect full-year fiscal 2024 adjusted gross margins to end up right around 40% following the continued proportional increase in Loitering Munitions Systems revenue and a decrease in small UAS revenue. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, Slide 13 of the earnings presentation shows a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $29 million, representing an increase of $5 million, or 21% from the third quarter of last fiscal year. The main factors contributing to this increase were stronger revenue and gross margin, which was partially offset by increased investments in R&D and incremental SG&A expenses. SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization and acquisition-related expense for the third quarter was $26 million, or 14% of revenue, compared to $21 million, or 15% of revenue in the prior year. The increase of SG&A expense is primarily -- partially result of the Tomahawk acquisition and continued expansion of our domestic and international sales teams. R&D expense for the third quarter was $25 million, or 13% of revenue, compared to $16 million, or 12% of revenue in the prior year. The increase of R&D expense in both terms, in dollar terms and percentage of revenue is a result of investments in the next generation Group 1 UAV, the maritime version of the JUMP 20, investment in our HAPS solar aircraft and investment in new products. We are continuing to spend AV R&D dollars on some of our U.S. DOD programs for which funding has been delayed due to the pending finalization of the U.S. federal budget for government fiscal year 2024. We now expect R&D to run in the high teens as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter as a result of continued investment in our long-term growth initiatives and the DOD budget delays. Now turning to GAAP earnings. In the third quarter, the company generated a net income of $13.9 million versus a net loss of $0.7 million recorded in the same period last year. The increase in net income of $14.6 million can be attributed to several factors, namely, a $22.5 million increase in adjusted gross margin, a $3 million increase in other income, a $2.7 million decrease in interest expense, a $1.9 million decrease in intangible amortization and other acquisition-related expenses. These were partially offset by a $9 million increase in R&D spending, a $5.7 million increase in SG&A expenses excluding intangible amortization, and a $1.8 million increase in taxes. Slide 10 shows a reconciliation of GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP diluted EPS. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $0.33 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to the balance sheet, at the close of the third quarter, our total cash and investments amounted to $129 million compared to $121.5 million at the end of the second quarter. We had a very strong cash quarter which enabled us to pay down $40 million in our term loan facility. Working capital decreased $29 million during the quarter, primarily due to the reduction in accounts receivable and inventories. However, we anticipate working capital usage to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as we move forward. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with over $100 million of cash and investments and approximately $100 million available under our working capital facility. I'd like to conclude with some highlights of our backlog metrics. Slide 8 of the earnings presentation provides a summary of our current fiscal 2024 visibility. As Wahid mentioned, our funded backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 finished at $463 million, lower sequentially due to headwinds from the continuing resolution and the elongated foreign military sales process. Despite these challenges, we have over 100% order visibility to the midpoint of our revised revenue guidance range. Now I'd like to turn the things back to Wahid.\nWahid Nawabi: Thanks, Kevin. With a strong third-quarter performance behind us, we're increasing and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal year 2024 as follows. We now anticipate revenue of $700 million to $710 million. Full-year net income of $51 million to $55 million or $1.86 to $2 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $122 million to $127 million. Non-GAAP earnings of $2.69 to $2.83 per diluted share. And R&D spend totaling 13% to 14% of revenue. We remain confident in our growth trajectory for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our backlog remains strong, our visibility is nearly 100%, and our pipeline continues to expand. While we await approvals on the continuing resolution in supplemental assistance package in Congress, we remain hopeful that a bipartisan agreement will be reached soon. We stand ready with our cutting-edge battle-tested solutions and unmatched manufacturing capacity to meet our customers needs. Given our strong performance, we remain on a trajectory of our best year ever again. As stated in the past, our expectations for this year and beyond are not driven by a single product or customer, but by the overall expanding global demand and our autonomous AI-enabled unmanned solutions. We are ideally suited to continue this growth trajectory given our global installed base, battle-tested solution offering, successful track record, proven best-in-class technology, agile product development cycle, and unmatched manufacturing capacity. As our addressable markets expand, we remain well-positioned to benefit from budget priorities in the U.S. and abroad as an industry leader and the original defense technology innovator. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, let me summarize the key points from today's call. First, we delivered outstanding third-quarter results with record-breaking revenue and strong profitability. Second, our Loitering Munition segment delivered impressive year-over-year growth and achieved its highest quarterly revenue to date. Third, we're raising and tightening our fiscal year 2024 guidance range. And fourth, with a solid momentum, we anticipate double-digit top-line growth in fiscal year 2025. Thanks again to our investors for their support of our mission and company, and thank you to our customers for putting their faith in AeroVironment. Finally, thank you to our highly capable employees who strive to meet our customers' urgent needs and ensure our products deliver when it really counts. We are honored to support our country and allies at this critical time. As we close out fiscal year 2024, we look forward to further success in the years to come. And with that, Kevin, Jonah, and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, Wahid, Kevin, and Jonah. Nice results.\nWahid Nawabi: Hi, Peter. Thank you.\nKevin McDonnell: Thank you.\nPeter Arment: Hey, Wahid, you mentioned about capacity kind of expansion plans. I wonder if you could give a little more color on Switchblade capacity. I think we've all seen the numerous reports of kind of the opportunities that are in front of you for that product. And I know that there was thoughts that you guys already had existing capacity of a couple thousand units. Maybe you could just give us your thoughts on what -- where you think you're taking capacity to?\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Peter. So, as I mentioned on the remarks, we have significantly increased our Switchblade production capacity in the past several quarters with the expectation of our customers and the demand that we see across the globe, number one. Number two, we have sufficient capacity right now to meet the increased demand that we're forecasting for the next two years. We believe that we're the only company out there in the entire world that can produce Loitering Munitions such as Switchblades by the thousands today. And we've delivered thousands of them in the last year and two years alone, as you know. And so beyond the next two years, we're already engaged in looking at new sites and new facilities and new expansion plans to go above and beyond that. And especially with programs such as Replicator, which were very heavily engaged with the U.S. Department of Defense and DIU, we expect that companies like AeroVironment, who has a very unique capability to be able to produce them in volume at proven record level of rigor and reliability, and safety, will benefit from this heightened demand and customer need. So we remain ready, we have been delivering products very, very effectively in the last several quarters and in couple of years, and we look forward to the additional demands that are coming our way, which is all very positive for us.\nPeter Arment: Yeah. Yeah. And just as my second question, just -- could you give a little more color around timing of LASSO, just -- is that being held up by the funding delays? And if that -- if we do get a resolution in March, when would you expect to kind of begin to ship units? Thanks again, Wahid.\nWahid Nawabi: So the U.S. Army has publicly stated that they're going to go through multiple tranches. And I believe that they've said that the first tranche AeroVironment is the sole source provider of the systems for the U.S. Army on their own public statements. We are working with them directly. If the budget approval happens through Congress, we're expecting that to turn into another contract sometimes, probably this summer or right thereafter. We're actively engaged with the U.S. Army, we know that that's a very key need by the U.S. Army as it's a directed requirement by General Rainey from the Army Futures Command. We're engaged with their office as well as the acquisitions executives within Pentagon, and we're prepared to support them. In fact, one of the reasons why we've increased our capacity is because we're expecting them to work through the budget process and eventually award contracts for us to deliver more. It is one of the key program records that we're pursuing, as I mentioned on my remarks, and there were many others besides that as well, that we're pursuing, Peter.\nPeter Arment: Thanks so much. I'll leave it at two.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Konrad: Good evening.\nWahid Nawabi: Hi, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Hey. Maybe just to start, you know your comments about phasing out Raven. How meaningful is Raven today? And just thinking about OE and some of the service volume tied to that, and how do you think about the phasing of any replacement in terms of that bridge whenever Raven does phase out?\nWahid Nawabi: So, Greg, I'm glad you asked that question, because Raven, as you know, has been the workhorse of the U.S. military's small UAS for the last two decades. We're very proud of that. We've got over 20,000 of those units shipped around the world, and U.S. Army is one of the largest customers of Raven. In the last several years, Raven has not been the primary driver of our revenue or shipments at all. In fact, it's been in a sustainment mode for the most part. And so sunsetting that program by the U.S. Army, A. will take several years, most likely, it won't happen overnight, and B. it's not going to be a material financial impact to our environment. In fact, we're very bullish and we're very excited that the army did that, so they can expedite the next generation of systems, which we're pursuing those requirements with our next generation systems. The primary driver of our small UAS revenue, as I mentioned on the remarks, has been and continues to be the Puma system. And Puma is really by far the most prominent driver of the revenue for small UAS. Raven is almost insignificant and has been for the last several, two years to three years at least. So we don't expect that to have any negative impacts. And in fact, we consider that as an instigator of potentially expediting the next program of record, which is referred to as MRR, Medium Range Reconnaissance, and LRR, which is the Long Range Reconnaissance. We have solutions for those requirements. We're working with the customers and we look forward to that. And I think that is going to be another tranche of demand over the next several years for AeroVironment's small UAS systems in the future.\nGreg Konrad: And then just one follow-up. I think you said working capital would be lumpy given the good inventory and receivable in the quarter, but I think that was the first down inventory sequentially in maybe five or six quarters. Anything to read in terms of that? In terms of supply chain stabilization or anything else around that working capital move?\nKevin McDonnell: Well, I'll take that. Basically, we've kind of reached, if you look at our revenue trend, it's kind of reached another level of the $180 or so million. So the working capital usage was to get us up to that level. Obviously, we're going to continue to increase and grow the business, but this is a 30% growth year when you look -- if you go to the midpoint of our guidance range, with a 20% growth year last year. So that's a lot of growth over a two-year period. And you're right, it's the first quarter and I think over two years that we've had a down sequential working capital quarter. But as we move forward we'll see quarters where it'll go up and down depending upon what the demand is in the following quarters.\nGreg Konrad: Okay, I'll leave it at that. Thank you.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Skibitski: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nWahid Nawabi: Hey, Pete.\nPeter Skibitski: Hey guys. As you look into fiscal 2025 and you've given a double-digit top-line target. I'm wondering given that -- on the gross margin line, should we expect the current -- the recent trends to continue? In other words, that revenue continues to shift towards product sales, and within product sales, we continue to shift towards LMS. And so maybe overall gross margin is sort of flattish in fiscal 2025, is that the right way to think about it?\nWahid Nawabi: Yeah, I think that's a good way to think about it.\nKevin McDonnell: Yeah, absolutely. Pete, as I said on the remarks, I mean, our gross margin is very healthy, very solid. We've made a lot of adjustments in our product portfolio and mix that has resulted in that. And we obviously provide you with our fiscal 2025 guidance next quarter. But we feel very strong that our business is at a growth mode and both our services as well as our products margins are quite favorable and improved quite a bit over the last several quarters.\nPeter Skibitski: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then just on Switchblade, I guess, for fiscal 2024, can you give us a sense of how many international customers you're actually delivering to? Obviously, Ukraine is one, but any other major orders internationally that you've delivered to in fiscal 2024 and any that are kind of near-term expected?\nWahid Nawabi: So, Pete, we are working with a very large number of customers. As I said in my remarks, well over 20 countries that have shown and demonstrated real strong desire to acquire Switchblade. About a third of those countries are in the actual export license approval process with the U.S. State Department and with us and with the respective militaries. I'm not able to specify a country because of the sensitivity of those countries and our customers respect [indiscernible] respect our customers' needs for that. What I can tell you is that the pipeline is robust. The demand is going to be a long enduring demand in my view. And I believe that the number of countries and customers are going to continue to grow and not shrink, in fact, over time. They're all in different phases of acquisition and many of them we haven't delivered yet, many of them. So a lot of that demand is still to come in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. And that's why we feel bullish about our Switchblade business in general. As we market -- as we grow into this business, the market is expanding and our solutions track record also has literally convinced customers that there is no alternative to Switchblade. There's nothing that can match this capability of Switchblade in the battlefield. And so we're quite bullish on that front for the long run.\nPeter Skibitski: Okay, appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie DiPalma: Wahid, Kevin, and Jonah, good afternoon.\nWahid Nawabi: Hi, Louie.\nJonah Teeter-Balin: Hey, Louie.\nKevin McDonnell: Hi, Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: Various media reports reference the Switchblade as a top contender for Replicator. I'm sure you saw on the call you discussed the tremendous demand for the Puma over the past two years. Is the Puma also a Replicator contender?\nWahid Nawabi: So I will not speculate on things that the U.S. DOD is working on. What I can tell you, Louie, that is -- we are very engaged with both DIU as well as the Pentagon in different branches of the services. We do agree with you that our systems essentially if you look at the AeroVironment's portfolio, the entire portfolio of our solution set is essentially a poster [ph] child of what the Replicator initiative is all about. It's all about intelligent, multidomain distributed unmanned systems and robotics that are coupled and integrated with AI and autonomy in battle and contested environments. And it's also about low cost, high volume. That is precisely what AeroVironment's DNA and identity and background and current portfolio is all about. And so multiple of our solutions could be candidates and should be candidates for Replicator. I'm not in a position to speculate on any of the details, although we're very heavily engaged with the U.S. Department of Defense, with DIU, as well as the various services to make sure that we stand ready. The other thing that's really important about the Replicator that I want to highlight is, as you heard from the military leaders and from the Pentagon, the whole concept of Replicator is supposed to be things that you can go into production fast. Well, all of the systems that I described to you today, and you see in our portfolio is in production level today. And in most cases, we have produced thousands of them already. So the ability for us to be able to deliver tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands is way, way better than anyone else in the entire industry. And so we think that that would play a big role because scaling manufacturing production at high levels of reliability and lower cost is key to the success of U.S. against our top adversaries in the world. And the Replicator initiative is all about that. So I think we're positioned quite well.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And following up on Peter's question, is the LASSO tranche one award that you were like verbally given, is that now in backlog for the end of this quarter? Or does there need to be the 2024 budget appropriations to be passed in order for that tranche one award to be funded and for it to be formally given to you?\nWahid Nawabi: I think that it's all based on the budget approval within Congress, Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: Okay.\nWahid Nawabi: So many of those orders are not so far reflected in our backlog. I won't be able to comment on any specific ones, but there is several of our potential opportunities that are still within the budget approval process, and it's tied up in Congress. And also there is additional, as you know, tranches that the U.S. DoD's and the White House is planning to provide to Ukraine. And we believe that we should also be great candidates for those tranches as part of the assistance packages.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And one final one. How dependent is the fiscal 2025 -- like double-digit growth on major Ukraine stimulus funding?\nWahid Nawabi: Not much at all, Louie. We are expecting our 2025 to be very -- another record year for us. Obviously, we'll provide you the details next quarter, but we're sitting at a very high level of the backlog right now. Our position in the market is really strong. Our track record of delivering and our top product is performing in the battlefield, real relevant battlefield today is extremely high. Our customer satisfaction level is excellent and high. And I believe that the demand is going to continue to grow and many of those opportunities are not in our current backlog or expectations for next year.\nLouie DiPalma: Awesome. That's it from me. Thanks, everyone.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Louie.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Strackhouse: Hi, Wahid, Kevin, and Jonah, this is Steve Strackhouse on for Ken Herbert. Congrats on the quarter, guys.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you.\nJonah Teeter-Balin: Hi, Steve.\nStephen Strackhouse: So, just wanted to start on the seasonality of the business. I was hoping if you kind of discuss what that kind of means for your business moving forward. Historically, the fourth quarter represented 30% plus of your revenue. And looking at the guide, it looks like it's going to be about flat, either sequentially or year-over-year. So just trying to think about -- just trying to get a gauge for how we should think about that moving forward?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure. So, Steve, I'm glad that you noticed that because I'm specifically mentioned in my remarks that due to the fact that we've been able to have a very large backlog at the beginning of the fiscal year, it allowed us to level load our factories in terms of production, which helped not only deliver product on an equal increments each quarter. So level load our revenue for the quarters, but also improved our throughput and increased our efficiencies in terms of margins improvements. So all of that has been a very, very positive for us. So we intentionally this past year been fortunate and intentionally decided to level load our factories. And it's quite remarkable how well we've been able to achieve that throughout the whole year. Given the fact that we're growing nearly 30% of the midpoint of our guidance for the year, we've been level-loaded the year at each quarter almost equal quarters. So that's really good. Going forward, it obviously is too early to determine that, but we are always trying our best to level load our factories to have a large backlog going into the next year, that allows us to afford all these synergies, that helps us improve a lot of things. Not to mention also that we -- our customers would prefer to receive products as early, as soon as possible. So those things all are our intentions and more to come on that for next fiscal year.\nStephen Strackhouse: Great. And then maybe just one more as a follow-up. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the recent CR and the fiscal budget for 2024. It sounds like most people, as we've gone through this earnings season, have kind of just continued to push it to the right as far as expectations. Can you maybe just outline some of yours as to kind of where we sit now?\nKevin McDonnell: So, Steve, given our strong backlog in visibility for this fiscal year and fourth quarter, the continuing resolution is not going to impact our revenue for fiscal year 2024 this fiscal year. And since we have a fairly strong backlog, even the first quarter of next year should be quite manageable. However, if this continuing resolution were to elongate and go beyond this fiscal year of AeroVironment, obviously it's not going to be a good news for anybody. And so from that perspective, we're hopeful that a bipartisan budget is passed, there is fairly good signs this past couple of weeks in Congress. There are many other experts that know a lot more about that than I, so I won't speculate. But what I can tell you is that we're prepared. We believe that our systems are high priority. We believe that our military really needs these capabilities. And the stockpiles are still quite low in terms of Loitering Munitions and small unmanned systems. And the war in Ukraine and the Middle East still is continuing, and there -- we don't see an end to that anytime soon, from what I'm reading and I'm understanding from what's going on. So, therefore, I think we're positioned quite well. But we just need Congress to get over the hurdle and pass a budget, and I think everything will be much better off as a result.\nStephen Strackhouse: Appreciate it. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.\nKevin McDonnell: Welcome.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Jonah for closing remarks.\nJonah Teeter-Balin: Thank you once again for joining today's conference call and for your interest in AeroVironment. As a reminder, an archived version of this call, SEC filings, and relevant news can be found under the investor section of our website. We wish you a good evening and look forward to speaking with you again following next quarter's results.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

We will now begin with remarks from Wahid Nawabi. Wahid?\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Jonah. Welcome everyone to our fiscal year 2024 second quarter earnings conference call. I'll start by summarizing our performance and recent achievements, after which Kevin will review our financial results in detail. I will then provide information about our outlook including our increased revenue projections for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. Kevin, Jonah and I will then take your questions. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results once again exceeded expectations and we remain on track for our best year ever. Our key messages, which are also included on Slide number 3 of our earnings presentation are as follows. First, second quarter revenue rose to $180.8 million, up 62% year-over-year, representing a record Q2 for AeroVironment. We also posted very strong bottom line results powered by record demand, strong operating execution and effective supply chain management. Second, we have a healthy backlog of $487 million, which is higher than the start of our fiscal year and provides solid visibility for the quarters ahead. Third, on our last call, we announced our intention to acquire privately held Tomahawk Robotics, which we successfully completed in September. As I will review in a moment, we are well on our way to fully integrate the two businesses, while leveraging our combined technology across our portfolio. And fourth, we are updating guidance including an increase to our revenue target, reflecting our strong performance and the impact from the Tomahawk acquisition. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance through the first half of this fiscal year, which included significant topline revenue acceleration and record EBITDA. We remain optimistic about our future exemplified by higher growth, improving operating results and enhanced value creation for our shareholders. As we said last quarter, this reflects not only near-term demand dynamics related to global complex but also a long-term shift in military strategy to the more frequent use of intelligent multi-domain Unmanned Systems which are either use, highly effective and provide a compelling value proposition. Our differentiated portfolio offers the greatest breadth and depth of unmanned solutions to meet the growing demands of our country and allies. We are an industry leader in contested environment as well as AI-enabled autonomous operations and governments around the globe are witnessing these unmatched capabilities effectively perform on real and highly contested battlefields. As a testament to the incredible effectiveness of our innovative solutions, we now have nine different unmanned platforms deployed in Ukraine, all receiving high levels of praise. We could not be prouder and more honored of how our solutions and team members are helping our customers successfully achieve their vital missions. We're also pleased with our progress on fully integrating Tomahawk Robotics into our existing business. As a reminder, Tomahawk now part of our Unmanned Systems segment is a leader in AI-enabled robotic common control systems and open standard communications. As a company, we are increasing interconnectivity and interoperability across our portfolio, making it easier for our customers to successfully manage their growing fleet of Unmanned Systems. We have already received positive feedback from our customers and intend to leverage this combination to better support their current and future missions. We now offer an unmatched capability to integrate unmanned platforms across multiple domains while providing a common operating picture for the warfighter. For all the reasons just mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong value to our stakeholders in fiscal year 2024. We expect that our cutting-edge solutions will be at the forefront of government decision-making for years to come. Now let me provide an update on current developments within our segments. Starting with our Unmanned Systems segment, revenue more than doubled year-over-year. Shipments during the quarter continued to reflect strong demand across nearly all our product lines with significant growth in our Puma and JUMP 20 systems. We have nearly completed delivering all the Puma LE and Puma 3 AE systems which were part of last year's large Ukraine FMS order. We have received additional follow-on orders for Ukraine, which we expect to fulfill later this fiscal year. A portion of these new orders for Ukraine are direct commercial sales to the government of Ukraine. This is another testament to the battle-proven and industry-leading capabilities of our Puma system. We also began delivering the initial batch of JUMP 20 systems to Ukraine as part of our previously announced $42 million award under the Ukraine Security Assistance initiative. We remain confident that the JUMP 20 system is also the most capable solution and its class, and expect additional shipments to Ukraine and the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, it is important to highlight two recent successful tests of the JUMP 20. First, we successfully demonstrated a fully autonomous flight at the U.S. Navy's hybrid fleet campaign in QS, Florida. During the exercise, we showcased the JUMP 20's ability to launch and recover from a vessel moving more than 20 knots without user intervention. Second, our teams supported the U.S. Army and several allies at their Arcane Thunder exercise in Poland. This event held in September utilized several of our systems as part of a demonstration of the army's modernization initiatives. The customer response to the JUMP 20 has been very positive and we plan to continue investing in this platform to meet our customers' future needs. In summary, segment growth this quarter was due to record deliveries overseas and the demand for our system is expanding. There are multiple potential orders in the pipeline, which are not yet reflected in our backlog. The global trends we discussed previously, plus our healthy pipeline of opportunities provide even more reason to be optimistic about our Unmanned Systems segment for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Moving to our Loitering Munitions segment, as anticipated, this quarter's revenue was approximately flat year-over-year. Our shipments are meeting expectations and we continue to build inventory in anticipation of the numerous opportunities and our growing pipeline. Namely, we're expanding sales to allied countries across the globe, continuing shipments to Ukraine backfilling U.S. stockpiles and pursuing future DoD programs of record. We're actively in negotiations with the U.S. government to secure a large multi-year sole-source IDIQ contract for Loitering Munitions products, which will meet the substantial U.S. DoD and international allies demand. There's also proposed legislation in Congress to continue supporting Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which includes additional funding for Switchblade. We continue to make progress with new international customers. We're currently engaged with more than 20 countries who wish to receive Switchblades. And about a third of those cases are actively in the U.S. DoD's export approval process. At the same time, we've responded to multiple U.S. DoD customer RFPs for multi-year programs of record acquisitions this past quarter. These include the U.S. Marine Corps solicitation for its organic precision fires or OPF program and the U.S. Army's low altitudes stocking and strike coordinates for LASSO program. The U.S. Army recently stated that AeroVironment will receive a sole source contract to provide 100 Switchblade 600s for LASSO increment one for testing and fielding. We're optimistic about the future of this program due to the incredible real world performance of our Switchblades and our significant high volume manufacturing capacity. We're also working on integrating Switchblades onto other vehicle platforms such as Abrams tanks, Humvees, the next-generation optionally manned Fighting Vehicles and on helicopters through the Long Range Precision Munition program. To summarize, the LMS pipeline is robust with many opportunities not yet reflected in our backlog and we remain optimistic about the future growth potential of this business. We expect the LMS segment to be a stronger contributor of revenue growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Moving to our MacCready Works segment. Quarterly revenue was also roughly in line with last fiscal year, as this segment continues to focus on developing key technologies and incubating future digital solutions. Our HAPS team continues to make progress on the development of a full-scale next-generation Sunglider while also working with the U.S. DoD on defense missions. We expect to benefit from additional funding perhaps and the government fiscal year 2024 budget, which is awaiting approval by Congress. In addition, we continue to see strong engagement in developing novel next-generation defense solutions. Last quarter, we spoke about DARPA's ancillary program where we have now been awarded a small contract for Phase 1 of its development. We're also progressing on a jointly funded program under development by the U.S. Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command or DEVCOM in Natick, Massachusetts called the Squad Operations Advanced Resupply or SOAR. This large autonomous unmanned aircraft system will provide long-range precision delivery within contested environments. Flight testing of the first system is currently underway and we expect Phase 3 development to be funded by the government fiscal year 2024 budget as well. As you can see, we have many exciting and innovative development projects in our MacCready Works pipeline and remain excited about the potential to develop new capabilities, which could lead to new lines of business from this segment. With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin McDonnell for a review of the quarterly financials. Kevin?\nKevin McDonnell: Thank you, Wahid. Today, I'll be reviewing the highlights of our second quarter performance, during which I will occasionally refer to both our press release and earnings presentation available on our website. Overall, we had another outstanding financial quarter as the second quarter finished strong in terms of revenue, adjusted gross margins and adjusted EBITDA, and backlog. As Wahid mentioned in his remarks, revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $180.8 million, an increase of 62% as compared to the $111.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Slide 5 of the earnings presentation provides a breakdown of revenue by segment for the quarter. Our largest segment during the quarter was Unmanned Systems, UMS, which is a combination of our small UAS, Medium UAS, UGV and recently added Tomahawk businesses. UMS had revenue of $132.8 million in the quarter, which is up 115% from last year's $61.6 million driven primarily by strong international demand for our Puma systems. As Wahid mentioned, we began -- we also began shipments of the JUMP 20 product to Ukraine during the quarter, which contributed to the revenue growth. Loitering Munitions Systems or LMS recorded revenue of $30.2 million, a 3% decrease as compared to the $31.1 million last year during Q2. The Switchblade 600 product was a primary driver of revenue during the quarter. And at the same time, we are beginning to ramp up the production of the Switchblade 300 Block 20 product, which was introduced earlier this year. Revenue from our MacCready Works segment came in at $17.8 million, a decrease of 6% as compared to the $18.8 million from the second quarter of last fiscal year. We continue to see strong demand for machine learning and autonomy capabilities with various agencies of the U.S. DoD and U.S. government agencies, which was offset by lower SoftBank-funded HAPS revenue. In Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, there is a breakdown between product and service revenue. Specifically during the second quarter, product revenue accounted for 81% of total revenues, a notable increase from the 56% in the corresponding quarter of the previous year due to strong product revenue from small UAS and to a lesser extent from lower COCO service operations. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, although, we expect product revenue to be close to 80% of total revenue, we also expect LMS revenue to increase as a percentage of product revenue. LMS revenues had lower gross margins relative to small UAS products, so we expect a shift to reduced product gross margins. Speaking of gross margins, Slide 6 of the earnings presentation shows the trend of adjusted product and service gross margins, while Slide 12 reconciles the GAAP gross margins to adjusted gross margins, which excludes intangible amortization expense and other non-cash purchase accounting items. In the second quarter, consolidated GAAP gross margins finished at 42% up from 23% in the previous year. The improvement in GAAP gross margins was largely a result of improved product service mix and strong product gross margins from international small UAS. Second quarter adjusted gross margins reached 43% marking a substantial increase from the 27% recorded in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the same factors as for the GAAP gross margins. Adjusted product gross margin for the quarter were 47% versus 38% in the second quarter of last fiscal year, due to the high mix of international revenue from our Small UAS products during the quarter. In terms of adjusted service gross margins, the second quarter was at 28% versus 12% in the same quarter last year. Last year, we had accelerated depreciation on a portion of our assets was negatively impacted our service gross margins. We expect fiscal year 2024 adjusted gross margins to end up in the high '30s to low '40s following the anticipated increase in Loitering Munitions Systems revenue in the second half of the fiscal year, both in terms of dollars and percentage of total revenues. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, Slide 18 -- Slide 13 of our earnings presentation shows a reconciliation of the GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $40 million representing an increase of $33 million as compared to the $7 million from the second quarter of last fiscal year. The main factors contributing to this increase were higher revenue and favorable revenue mix, which was partially offset by incremental SG&A expenses and investments in R&D. SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization and acquisition-related expense for the second quarter was $26 million or 14% of revenue compared to $19 million or 17% of revenue in the prior year. While R&D expense increased year-over-year in terms of dollar terms, R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was 12% versus 15% in the corresponding quarter of last year. We expect R&D to continue to run closer to 12% for the full year as we continue to invest in new products and upgrades to existing products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. This also includes internal funding of our HAPS solar aircraft. Now turning to GAAP earnings. In the second quarter, the company generated net income of $17.8 million versus a net loss of $6.7 million recorded in the same period last year. The increase in net income of $24.5 million can be attributed to several factors, namely $49.5 million increase in gross margin, driven by a rise in sales volume and improvements in revenue mix and $2.9 million decrease to intangible amortization and other acquisition-related expenses were partially offset by $11.6 million increase in taxes, $6.7 million increase in SG&A expense, $5.4 million increase in R&D spending, and $3.8 million increase in unrealized losses in equity related investments. Slide 10 shows the reconciliation of GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP diluted EPS. The company posted adjusted earnings per share -- diluted per share of $0.97 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 versus a $0.01 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet. Total cash and investments at the end of the quarter was $121.5 million, which is a decrease of $6.9 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we reduced our term debt by $50 million to $80 million. Inventories increased $6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by the Tomahawk acquisition. Inventories remain at these higher levels as we prepare for shipments in coming quarters and extra -- carry extra inventory as a result of supply chain risk minimization. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with over $100 million of cash and investments, and approximately $100 million available under our working capital facility. I'd like to conclude with some highlights of our backlog metrics. Slide 8 of the earnings presentation provides a summary of our current fiscal 2024 visibility. As Wahid mentioned, our funded backlog at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 finished at $487 million. Visibility to the midpoint of our revised FY '24 revenue guidance range is 98%. Now, I'd like to turn things back to Wahid.\nWahid Nawabi: Thanks, Kevin. Given our strong quarter performance and the addition of Tomahawk Robotics, we have revised our guidance and increased revenue outlook for fiscal year 2024 as follows. We anticipate revenues of $685 million to $705 million. Net income guidance of $45 million to $51 million or $1.66 to $1.90 per diluted share. This decrease reflects Tomahawk acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $119 million to $127 million and non-GAAP earnings of $2.46 to $2.70 per diluted share. We expect unevenly distributed second-half revenue split between each of the remaining two quarters of this fiscal year. Based on our record first-half performance and a strong backlog, we now have almost full visibility to the midpoint of our revised revenue guidance. And as expected, gross margin for the second half of this fiscal year is anticipated to be lower than first half primarily due to product mix. Lastly, while the situation in Washington has led to slower decision-making, we know our solutions are crucial to our customers in the U.S. and around the world. While operating under a continuing resolution slows down new program starts, we remain optimistic that budget priorities will be resolved and that our programs will eventually get funded. We hope that our supporters on both sides of the aisle can achieve consensus in the very near future. We are very pleased with our position midway through the fiscal year as we continue to meet the needs of our growing customers. The trends we see now represent an inflection point in our growth, which should drive greater demand beyond our current fiscal year. As I've stated in the past, our nation and allies are realizing the immense value proposition of our distributed autonomous Unmanned Solutions enabled by AI. We expect strong growth even when the act of conflicts wind down as there will be still an underlying need for deterrence with many new programs supporting further adoption of our innovative and battle-tested solutions. We continue to lead the industry in contested environment operations, autonomous missions and true Loitering Munitions capability. AeroVironment solutions can identify threats, track them in real-time and neutralize them with maximum effectiveness while minimizing collateral damage. We will continue to invest in our innovative solutions to ensure they meet our customers' exacting standards and perform when needed in real-world environments. Now let me once again summarize the key points from today's call. First, we delivered record second quarter results exceeding expectations and raised our revenue outlook for fiscal year 2024. Second, our backlog remains strong reflecting global demand for our innovative and combat-proven solutions. Third, we successfully completed the Tomahawk Robotics acquisition and are on track for onboarding this business into our Unmanned Systems segment. And fourth, the outlook for AeroVironment solutions continues to improve due to the strength of our product lines and accelerating global demand. We're well prepared to execute in the second half of this fiscal year and now expect further double-digit top-line growth in fiscal year 2025. Before turning the call over for -- to questions, we're excited to welcome retired General Joseph Votel to our Board of Directors. General Votel brings extensive knowledge of today's military operations and strategy, especially with Joint Special Operations Command or JSOC and Central Command or CENTCOM. His guidance will be instrumental in helping AV meet the current and future needs of our country and allies abroad. And finally, thank you to our investors for their unwavering support of our mission, and thank you to our customers for putting their faith in AeroVironment. Our success is due to the talent of our team who go above and beyond to continuously improve our products, strive for new innovative solutions, effectively manage the company's supply chain and meet our customers' needs in a timely and expeditious manner. We are honored to support our country and allies at this critical time and we expect further success during the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. And with that, Kevin, Jonah and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nGreg Konrad: Good evening, and great quarter.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to start. I might have missed it, but did you give any color around the contribution from Tomahawk and the revised guidance or how do we think about the higher guidance from core versus the Tomahawk contribution?\nWahid Nawabi: So, Greg, Tomahawk Robotics is now part of, as a product line within our Unmanned Systems segment. And as you know, we don't break down the details of each of our product lines, because we have several of them. However, what I can say is that in terms of our guidance to increase revenue topline guidance is attributed to both organic demand and growth in our business, as well as the -- a portion of it is related to the acquisition of Tomahawk. We believe that both of these two are fairly equally represented in terms of the demand for the second half of the year. We see strong growth and across our product lines and our [indiscernible] businesses as well as the addition of Tomahawk. So we're very excited about both.\nGreg Konrad: And then maybe just for the second one, I think on Tomahawk, you mentioned integration. Can you maybe provide roadmap and kind of timing and major milestones, when you think about that integration and maybe potential revenue synergies, and how you're thinking about timing and magnitude of some of those events?\nWahid Nawabi: Of course, for sure, so the feedback so far from our customers, which is the most important thing for me in particular has been extremely positive about the acquisition and the synergies that we're going to be able to deliver in terms of improving our customers' experiences in a common operating picture for the war-fighter. In terms of integration, we have a very detailed multiphase integration plan. We're on track or ahead of our schedule. They are now already integrated with our business in terms of being part of our Unmanned Systems segment. We have actually expanded the role and responsibility of the two co-founders of Tomahawk Robotics, they're now general managers of our larger businesses within AeroVironment. They're very excited about the prospects of the future. In terms of the roadmaps, we're already working some of those. We're very excited. And in fact, we're more bullish now than we were even before that there is tremendous synergies between our capabilities and our products and technologies, namely in the foreseeable future, we're going to be able to integrate pretty much all of our products, our Unmanned Ground Vehicles, our Unmanned UAVs, air vehicles, all with Tomahawk Robotics Common Controller, as well as would allow us to actually integrate other third party platforms into this effort. Now, that effort is a multiyear effort because there are lots and lots of demand for integration from external customers even in partners but also an upside there is significant opportunities for integrate. The last thing I want to mention is that their location in Southern -- in Florida, Eastern Florida actually is very positive for us too. They've got a tremendous team. We're very excited and encouraged by their talent both engineering and business. And we're going to actually start to scale our resources in terms of headcount even at their facilities. So it actually gives us a better footprint in the East Coast where most of our customers are as well as allow us to hire and grow our talent as our growth desires or requires it.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nWahid Nawabi: Welcome, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Your question, please.\nPeter Arment: Yeah. Good afternoon Wahid, Kevin and Jonah. Nice results.\nKevin McDonnell: Hi, Peter.\nWahid Nawabi: Good afternoon, Peter.\nPeter Arment: Hey. Wahid, could you give us the latest kind of status update of the Switchblade 600? I know there's been some recent articles out there about some of the Eastern European countries looking to, start to take delivery of that product. Where are we in terms of the potential production for the Switchblade 600?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure. So, I'm glad to report that we've had many -- several of the U.S. government and U.S. DoD's leadership, as well as Congressional leaders, visit us in the last couple of weeks related to our Switchblade production. We have a significant amount of production capacity, which we've invested in. We were very fortunate. And that's a major plus because we can deliver Switchblade by the thousands now and we can deliver them at U.S. DoD program of record quality and caliber and maturity. Secondly, there are several, about 20 different countries, that we're engaged in, in terms of their interest in acquiring Switchblade or wanting to receive Switchblade. About a third of those cases are already in active Department of State and Department of Defense export approval process. So I expect in the next six months or so that this process will go faster than before because the demand is very high and the U.S. defense organizations, as well as department of State is very favorable towards helping us equip these countries with Switchblade. We've delivered, quite a good chunk of those Switchblade 600s and 300s so far to the U.S. DoD, all of these cases so far for Switchblade remain to be NF -- FMS cases. So A, we delivered a lot, there's five countries that have already spoken for them and they've gone public about it and meant -- made its statements. There is a total of 20 countries that we're actively involved with. And about a third of those are actively in the export approval process, which is really, really encouraging and positive. In addition to that, Peter, I also want to mention that we're actively negotiating with the U.S. DoD on a very large multiyear IDIQ sole source Switchblade contract that allows the U.S. DoD to purchase large quantities of Switchblade for multiple years from AeroVironment and then actually fulfill the needs for Ukraine, for the U.S. DoD stockpiles and programs as well as for our allies and FMS cases. That actively is in process, but it will take some time, but it's very encouraging.\nPeter Arment: That's all great color. I appreciate that Wahid. And Kevin, maybe just a quick one for you on, you made some comments about that, you kind of expected the gross margin -- adjusted gross margin for the year to end up in the low 40s to high-30s. Maybe you could just -- that implies, I guess in the second half of the year, if you're going to be in the high-30s that you'd see that gross margin come down. I guess maybe the mid-'30s or so, is that primarily tied to the LMS revenue ramp or can you maybe highlight, maybe some of the puts and takes there? Thanks.\nKevin McDonnell: Right. So you kind of have a combination of a little bit lower small UAS revenue and that's kind of replaced by the lower margin LMS coming in the second half.\nPeter Arment: Okay. Great. Thanks again. Nice results.\nKevin McDonnell: Thank you, Peter.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nKen Herbert: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.\nWahid Nawabi: Hey. Good afternoon, Ken.\nKen Herbert: Hey, Wahid. Maybe if I could just to sort of put a finer point on the mix impact in the second half of the fiscal year, what's your outlook for growth, specifically within LMS of -- within the LMS segment for the second half of the year? I mean, second quarter growth there, I mean, consistent with your expectations, but flattish down slightly. How much of the second half growth is going to come from that segment relative to UMS or MacCready Works?\nWahid Nawabi: So Ken, I'm glad you asked that question. First of all, this fiscal year Loitering Munitions as a whole, we expect it to be the strongest driver of our growth overall, it's going to be very, very robust growth for the whole year. That's our expectation. As we expected and as I said in my comments, the first half of the year is very much in line to our expectations and how we thought it's going to play out, primarily because the contracts for Switchblade are very large lumpy contracts. We had a very strong fourth quarter. If you remember last fiscal year which we had a record shipments and record bookings that has allowed us to ship on the first quarter and second quarter, according to our plans. Second half is going to be very dominant in terms of growth and revenue driver for our Switchblade 300 and 600. We have a robust pipeline for Switchblade that is not only going to fuel our second-half performance in terms of revenue and bookings, but it's also going to fuel our fiscal '25 and beyond. I mean the pipeline for Switchblade 300 and 600 looks extremely promising. It just takes a little while, primarily because of the nature of the product, the government contracting process and the FMS approval process that we have to go through for all these exports. But overall, I think second half is going to be dominant by our Loitering Munitions business both in terms of bookings as well as in terms of revenue performance for the year.\nKen Herbert: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe, Wahid or Kevin, what's your outlook for full year free cash flow? I mean you sort of used 36 or so through the first half of the year, your significant investments in working capital. Do we expect much relief in positive free cash in the second half of the year or how do we think about the full year from a cash basis?\nKevin McDonnell: I mean, I'm not banking too much on a lot of relief. I think the working capital levels will stay around this mark here in the third and fourth quarter, maybe even up a little in the third quarter and then come down a little bit in the fourth quarter. And then I think you'll start to see some improvement at least as a percentage of overall sales in FY '25.\nKen Herbert: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Your question, please.\nPete Skibitski: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys.\nWahid Nawabi: Hi, Pete.\nPete Skibitski: I guess one for me, how do you guys -- what's the right way to think about the kind of the timeframe or the path to improve LMS gross margins and what are the major factors that impact that through the mid-term?\nWahid Nawabi: Well, Pete, we actually have seen fairly strong improvement on the gross margin of our Switchblade product line as a whole relative to the last several years and we continue to make even more progress. Having said that, our small UAS especially international contracts and orders are by far the most profitable products because we've invested for many, many years in that product line and we're able to sell those as a commercial item to a lot of our international customers. So while -- our small UAS has set up very, very high bar in the industry, if not only just for AeroVironment. Switchblade gross margins and profitability is fairly strong and it's improving. How well that it's going to be -- usually our hardwareâ€™s are in the upper 40 -- mid '40s or low '40s, and Switchblade are on a mid to high '30s. So it's not that much off of our small UAS and it's improving. We have several activities and strategies on improving that one of which of course of course is volume and lowering the cost inputs and allowing us to actually get more efficient in production, which we are making significant improvements and our team has managed that really well. The second thing is also in terms of improving the cost in terms of the Block 20 product. Switchblade Block 20 and the next-generation systems are actually easier to manufacturer, has less labor content and much more automation in terms of its manufacturing capability. So we've got several activities, which many of them have already paid some dividend. And they'll continue to pay dividend going forward as well.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. That's a great color. I appreciate it. Just one more from me. I just want to understand, guys, in terms of this big Switchblade, IDIQ, that's coming down the pike, how will that product sort of and how that meets Army requirements? How would that differ from the LASSO contract for the Army, assuming you win, LASSO at some point, I don't know what the timeframe is on that. But it seems like similar products, so I don't know if LASSO is deemed as a mid-to long-term replacement for the, Switchblade IDIQ or what's the right way to think about that?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure, Pete. So let me add some comments or color to this thing. Historically, U.S. Army has been the main contracting office for procuring Switchblades for U.S. DoD as well as for our allies and that remains still the case right now for the most part. And if you used to have a large contract that we bought under for multiple years, and since the demand has gone up so much higher, that contract has reached its ceiling. So now, the U.S. government basically buy these on individual UCAS or undefinitized contract action items -- actions, which is laborious for both the government as well as for us. What they have started to do is to actually initiate another very large multi-year sole-source IDIQ contract for all Switchblade both for U.S. DoD as well as our allies. So the LASSO contract and some of the other ones, until the large multi-year contract is in place will still be executed and awarded to us based on these UCAS but long term what we want is a larger contract vehicle that allows the U.S. government to buy for many customers, many opportunities and funding sources and fulfill those much easier. So we're very pleased that the U.S. Army and U.S. DoD has taken that initiative. We're actively working that it's going to take some while because of the CR situation as well as with the bandwidth of U.S. DoD in terms of contracting resources, but we feel very good. We've already turned in our proposals. We're negotiating the rate structures. And I think it's going to be more of a matter of when versus if. And when that goes into effect, then it actually allows a lot more volume to go through and a lot more procurement to happen much faster and from the timing. And so we're looking forward to that, it will be very, very positive for us and for our customers.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you.\nKevin McDonnell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your question, please.\nLouie DiPalma: Wahid, Kevin and Jonah, good afternoon.\nWahid Nawabi: Good afternoon, Louie.\nJonah Teeter-Balin: Good afternoon, Louie.\nKevin McDonnell: Good afternoon.\nLouie DiPalma: I'm following up on several of the recent questions. You mentioned the Army announcing that they awarded AeroVironment 100 LASSO systems. Is -- are those 100 systems already in backlog? And what's the general expected timeline for the LASSO program in terms of Phase 1 and subsequent phases?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure. So Louie that particular contract award has two very positive aspects to it and that's why I highlighted it. Number one, it is the first initial tranche of the LASSO program record potentially, which puts us in a very, very good position. So eventually as you know these programs will be completed, but to be already selected on the first phase and have product go into the U.S. Army for testing and fielding is very, very positive. Secondly that order is not in our backlog. So while our Switchblade and Loitering Munitions business backlog is pretty healthy, we -- many of these opportunities that I mentioned on the -- on my comments is not reflected on our current backlog. All of these opportunities are additional orders and contracts that we expect to book in the next six to 12 months. And in fact that demand continues to increase rather than decrease in terms of its space as well as the topline. So our pipeline and our portfolio looks very robust for Switchblade both 300 and 600. And domestically, we've got several programs, internationally we've got lots of countries. And we're also working on many other platforms to integrate Switchblade onto such as Humvees, the Abrams, and [indiscernible] et cetera, et cetera. So, all in all, we've got a lot more upside on our Switchblade product lines over the next six months -- six to 12 months in terms of orders.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And I think you and Kevin both mentioned that the second half of the year should be heavy in terms of both Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600. And will Switchblade 600s also be shipped to those five international customers in the second half or some of those five international customers?\nWahid Nawabi: The answer is yes, Louie. Many of those international customers, I can't specifically name any of them because of the respect and confidentiality for customers. But vast majority, if not all of those customers desire and have requested both Switchblade 300 and 600. And same is true for the supplemental budget that is in front of Congress for Ukraine, the $100 billion plus budget item, the supplemental package that's in front of Congress that is for Israel, Ukraine and potentially Taiwan. There are line item dollars for both Switchblade 300 and 600 for those three countries. And so, we feel pretty strong that long term since Switchblade 600 is a fairly newer product in terms of its life in the market is going to be equally as large of a product and revenue generator for us as a 300. And obviously the selling price of the 600 is significantly higher, because it's a much bigger Loitering Munition.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And one last one for Kevin, do you expect SoftBank -- or for both of you, do expect SoftBank to continue funding HAPS? And is AeroVironment prepared to continue funding HAPS and Sunglider on its own if SoftBank drops out?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure. So A, SoftBank is very committed to this program. We are working with them very closely. They continue to fund us although the funding for them has reduced slightly because of their financial situation over the last couple of years. There's a much bigger discussion and known variables in the Japan's economic situation in the pandemic et cetera that's affecting that. Number one, that's the underlying reason. So -- however, SoftBank is very committed to us. We're actively engaged with them. We're dial -- we're talking to them all the time, very regularly. And we're progressing that process. So I do not expect them to start funding our Sunglider anytime soon. They're committed to the mission. They still believe in the platform and we believe in the long-term value proposition perhaps. It's just that they have intentionally slowed down over the last two years because of the overall macroeconomic situation that they are faced with. Secondly, we are funding it with some small amount primarily because there is IP involved, and we would like to make sure that we own and we look to protect. We've always done that and we'll continue to do that. And lastly, we have received our initial contract award from the U.S. DoD and there is additional funding a significant amount of funding actually relatively speaking, and the government fiscal year '24 budget for HAPS and the U.S. DoD budget. So, when the government fiscal year '24 budget is approved, we expect that eventually to transition into a contract AeroVironment and we're actively working this program with the U.S. DoD, there's very strong support and desire for this capability in the U.S. DoD as well.\nLouie DiPalma: Excellent. Thanks, Wahid. Thanks, Kevin and Jonah as well.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome, Louie.\nKevin McDonnell: Thanks, Louie.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question is a follow-up from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nKen Herbert: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on the EPS guidance. I mean, you did just under $2 in adjusted EPS in the first half. The guidance implies, $0.60 to $0.70 in the second half of the year at the upper end of the range. Aside from mix as you really ramp Switchblade sales, is there anything else in particular of the EPS that's sort of driving the significant step down first half to second half?\nKevin McDonnell: We definitely expect a step up in R&D in the second half of the year. So that's going to be part of the equation there for the EPS. So you're going to see a little bit lower margins, you're going to see a step-up of the R&D expense in the second half.\nKen Herbert: Okay. So mix in R&D I guess would be how we should think about that.\nKevin McDonnell: Yeah. That's right. Normally, our years are all reversed around. So there's a little bit of a backwards here.\nWahid Nawabi: Yeah. And as I've said to Ken on my remarks, as you saw, we have an exciting number of other programs and projects where there's a lot of demand for those systems including the DARPA ancillary, the SOAR program with the U.S. Army and with the OSB for large contested logistics capability, those programs are getting a lot of traction. And we do not want to slow down those efforts and make sure that even though if there is a continuing resolution we accelerate those things because the desire and demand by the U.S. DoD for those capabilities is very high. And we also believe that we're very unique in the sense that our solutions are considered the most innovative and the most capable in these categories that the U.S. duty is feeling very strongly about. So we're going to expect to actually ramp up R&D investments in the second half to support those developments in order to fuel our future growth and share -- shareholder value creation.\nKen Herbert: Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks, Wahid and Kevin.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Jonah for any further remarks.\nJonah Teeter-Balin: Thank you once again for joining today's conference call and for your interest in AeroVironment. As a reminder, an archived version of this call, SEC filings and relevant news can be found under the Investors section of our website. We wish you a good evening and look forward to speaking with you again following next quarter's results.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

Joining me today from AeroVironment are Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wahid Nawabi and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Kevin McDonnell. We will now begin with remarks from Wahid Nawabi. Wahid?\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Jonah. Welcome everyone to our fiscal year 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. I'll start by summarizing our performance and recent achievements, after which, Kevin will review our financial results in the greater detail. I will then provide information related to the outlook for fiscal year 2024, after which, Kevin, Jonah and I will take your questions. I'm pleased to report that we are off to a very strong first quarter, and we believe we're on-track for our best year ever. Our key messages, which are also included on Slide #3 of our earnings presentation, are as follows: First, first quarter revenue rose to $152 million, a 40% increase year-over-year and our best Q1 in AV's history. This reflects a robust demand for our market leading intelligent unmanned systems domestically and abroad. Second, our funded backlog rose to a new record of $540 million up from $424 million at start of fiscal year 2024. This backlog reflects $268 million of new bookings due in the first quarter. Third, we recently announced that AV will purchase privately-held Tomahawk Robotics enabling multi-domain control of a wide variety of unmanned solutions from one user interface. And fourth, we're raising our previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2024 which I will cover later in more detail. Gross margin for the first quarter was $65.7 million, an increase of 95% versus last fiscal year's $33.7 million, and our gross margin as a percentage of sales rose to 43% from 31% in fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect gross margins to remain strong in fiscal year 2024, as our revenue mix shifts to more favorable product sales. Overall fiscal year 2024 is off to a great start, and we're squarely on-track to meet our increased outlook for the full-year. Global trends continue to support broader long-term adoption of our solutions, and we aim to take the Company to new levels in both scale and performance this year and beyond. In-line with our strategy, we recently agreed to acquire Tomahawk Robotics for $120 million, a leader in AI-enabled robotic common control systems and open standard communication technologies. We believe this transaction will enable AV to provide a deeper, broader and simpler integration between our own and other unmanned solutions, making it easier for our customers to successfully operate a variety of unmanned solutions in the field. Tomahawkâ€™s technology will streamline the operation of AV's family of unmanned systems, enabling our users to achieve their missions with greater efficient and simplicity. Tomahawkâ€™s Kinesis Ecosystem provides unmatched tactical capabilities utilizing an AI-enhanced open architecture control system that operating, that seamlessly integrates any unmanned asset providing a common operating picture for the operator. We expect Kinesis to enable AVâ€™s products to achieve an elevated modular open systems approach, which is in high demand by customers across the globe. In addition, combining features of AV's Crysalis operating system with the Kinesis platform means pairing the best common controller technology with the most ubiquitous unmanned systems on the market today. AV and Tomahawk have been working together over the past few years integrating Tomahawkâ€™s Kinesis control system with AV's small unmanned aircraft family of systems including Raven B and Puma 3 AE. Through our partnership, we have gained firsthand knowledge of the solutions that Tomahawk offers, and we're confident that the combined experience and expertise of our two teams will result in a variety of unmatched, unmanned expeditionary vehicles that meet our customers' emerging needs and exacting standards. Once the transaction closes, which we expect to occur later this quarter, Tomahawk will operate as an additional product line reporting into our Unmanned Systems segment led by Senior Vice President and General Manager, Trace Stevenson. We expect this transaction to drive incremental revenues, adjacent market growth opportunities and product performance synergies driven by the integration of our prospective technologies. All of this should drive increased shareholder value. We will provide updated guidance during our second quarter earnings call reflecting the impact of this transaction to our anticipated fiscal year 2024 performance. Before turning to the product lineâ€™s results, I want to remind everyone that we consolidated our businesses into three reporting segments at the beginning of this fiscal year, Unmanned Systems, Loitering Munitions, and MacCready Works. Starting with our Unmanned Systems segment, revenue grew 45% year-over-year to a record $98.2 million. Shipments during the quarter were driven by strong demand across a broad range of products, particularly our Puma systems, which are urgently needed overseas. We continue to deliver Puma LE and Puma 3 AE systems through last year's large Ukraine foreign military sales order, but are nearly through the $176 million ceiling value with a portion to be delivered in the second quarter. Looking ahead, our backlog remains robust. Moving to our JUMP 20 system, we recently secured a $42 million contract from the U.S. Army for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative or USAI. JUMP 20 will be the first Group 3 UAS platform provided by the U.S. Department of Defense to Ukraine. This is also the largest aircraft platform that the U.S. DoD has provided to Ukraine so far. We plan to ship these systems during our second quarter of this fiscal year. We remain confident that our JUMP 20 is the most mature and capable solution in its class. We also recently finalized a 10-year tactical assistant agreement with Mexico for our JUMP 20 systems, allowing AV to continue providing UAS support and training to the government of Mexico's armed forces through the foreseeable future. The Mexican armed forces continue to rely upon JUMP 20 as the only Group 3 UAS platform in their operations. With an Unmanned Ground Vehicles or UGV, we recently received another order from the Danish Ministry of Defense for 21 ground robot systems, a mix of telemax and tEODor products, which are the first for that nation. We've also delivered the initial batch of five UGV systems to the Netherlands under a prior 30 robot contract. At the same time, we continue to mark progress providing UGVs to Ukraine, on an accelerated schedule which are performing life-saving EOD missions in the field. Given our growing backlog across the entire Unmanned Systems segment, we're confident we're on-track for another great year. Moving to our Loitering Munitions segment. I'm pleased to say that growth continues with sales up 34% year-over-year. This reflects Switchblade shipments to an expanding number of allied countries across the globe. Recent demand for Switchblade 300 and 600 systems has been largely driven through the latest USAI and the U.S. government. The U.S. army recently awarded us another contract for Switchblade 600 loitering munitions in support of the USAI. At the same time, we anticipate the U.S. government will continue to backfill and increase depleted DoD stockpiles. Additionally, we are responding to a Request for Information or RFI related to the U.S. Marine Corps Organic Precision Fire or OPF program. Overall, we anticipate both U.S. and international demand for our loitering munitions systems to remain strong through the rest of fiscal year 2024. It is also important to mention that the last batch of our Switchblade 300 Block 10C configuration has been shipped and we have transitioned to the next generation Block 20 variant. Switchblade 300 Block 20 features significantly more endurance, a tablet-based Fire Control System, and other enhanced performance capabilities. Switchblade 300 Block 20 has successfully completed the U.S. Army Safety Confirmation Certification and is now being delivered to customers. Moving to our MacCready Works segment, I'm pleased to report that segment revenues also grew 31% year-over-year to $23.2 million. Weâ€™re also making solid progress in our Stratospheric Solar HAPS program, we successfully completed further flight tests using a smaller scale version of the new Sunglider aircraft. These tests allow our team to collect and analyze large amounts of data, which could not otherwise be obtained from computer-based simulations. We will now apply these learnings to our next generation Sunglider while at the same time working with the FAA [for Type Certification] (ph). With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin McDonnell, for a review of the first quarter financials. Kevin?\nKevin McDonnell: Thank you, Wahid. Today, I will be reviewing the highlights of our first quarter performance, during which I will occasionally refer to both our press release and earnings presentation available on the website. Also, there is an 8-K available on our website, which recaps our historical results into the new segments. Overall, we started the first quarter extremely strong in terms of backlog, revenue, adjusted gross margins and adjusted EBITDA. As Wahid mentioned in his remarks, revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $152.3 million, an increase of 40% as compared to the $108.5 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Slide five of the earnings presentation provides a breakdown of revenue by segment for the quarter. Our largest segment during the quarter was Unmanned Systems, or UMS, which is a combination of our small UAS, medium UAS and UGV businesses with revenue of $98.2 million, an increase of 45% from last year's $67.8 million driven primarily by our small UAS business unit, which shipped systems to eight international countries during the quarter. Loitering Munitions Systems or LMS recorded revenue of $30.9 million, a 34% increase compared to the $23 million last year during Q1. LMS demand continues to be driven by strong U.S. and international orders. Revenue from our MacCready Works segment came in at $23.2 million an increase of 31% compared to the $17.7 million from the first quarter of last fiscal year. We continue to see strong demands in MacCready Works services within the various agencies of the U.S. DoD and U. S. government, in particular, increasing demand for incorporation of our computer vision, autonomy and AI capabilities. In slide five of the earnings presentation, there's a breakdown between product and service revenue. Specifically, during the first quarter, product revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues, a notable increase from 53% in the corresponding quarter of the previous year due to strong product revenues from our small UAS business and to a lesser extent from lower MUAS COCO service operations with the closure of all the site locations. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we expect product sales to remain above 70% of total revenue, but expect LMS sales to increase as a percentage of product sales which will have the impact of lowering overall product gross margins. Now turning to gross margins, slide six of the earnings presentation shows the trend of adjusted product and service gross margins, while slide 12 reconciles the GAAP gross margins to adjusted gross margins, which excludes the intangible amortization of other non-cash purchase accounting items. In the first quarter, consolidated GAAP gross margins finished at 43%, up compared to 31% in the previous year. The improvement in GAAP gross margins was largely a result of improved product service mix and strong product gross margins. In addition, gross margins were favorably impacted by a decrease of $4 million of depreciation on COCO ISR assets. Adjusted gross margins for the first quarter were 45% compared to 34% in the first quarter of last year. The improvement in adjusted gross margin was also driven by the improved service mix and strong product gross margins. Adjusted product gross margins for the quarter were 49% versus 44% in the first quarter of last fiscal year, again, to a higher mix of revenue from our small UAS products during the quarter. In terms of adjusted gross -- service gross margins, the first quarter was at 28% versus 22% during the same quarter last year. Again, due to the closure of the MUAS COCO operation sites. We expect adjusted gross margins to continue to be strong during the first half of the year, however, our product mix shifts during the second half of the year, we expect adjusted gross margins to end up in the high-30s for the year. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, slide 13 of our earnings presentation shows the reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $37 million, representing an increase of $24 million or 54%. The main factors contributing to this increase were higher sales volume and favorable sales mix, which was partially offset by incremental SG&A expenses and investments in R&D. SG&A expense, excluding intangible amortization and acquisition related expenses for the quarter was $23 million, or 15% of revenue compared to the first quarter in fiscal 2023 of $18 million or 16% of revenue. While R&D expense increased modestly year-over-year in dollar terms, R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was 10% versus 14% in the corresponding quarter of last year. R&D will run closer to 12% for the full-year, as we continue to invest in new products and upgrades to existing products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Now turning to GAAP earnings. In the first quarter, the Company generated a net income of $21.9 million versus a net loss of $8.4 million recorded in the same period last year. The increase in net income of $30.3 million can be attributed to several factors namely $31.9 million increase in gross margin, driven by a rise in sales volume and improvement of revenue mix, a $3.4 million decrease to intangible amortization and a $1.3 million decrease in taxes. This was partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in SG&A expenses, a $0.4 million increase in R&D spending, and a $0.2 million increase in unrealized loss on equity related investments. Slide 10 shows the reconciliation of GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP diluted EPS. The Company posted earnings per diluted share of $1 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $0.8 per diluted share loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments at the end of the quarter was $128.4 million which is a decrease of $28 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we reduced our long-term debt by $5 million to $130 million. Inventories increased $37 million during the quarter of fiscal 2024. Inventories will remain at these levels as we prepare for shipments in the coming quarters and carry extra inventory result of supply chain risk minimization. With that said, inventory as a percentage of backlog are in-line with recent historical averages, and down from COVID period averages. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with over $100 million of cash and investments and approximately $100 million available under our working capital facility. I'd like to conclude with some highlights of our backlog metrics. Slide eight of the earnings presentation provides a summary of our current fiscal 2024 visibility. As Wahid mentioned, our funded backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was a record $540 million, an increase of 27% from the prior quarter. Visibility to the mid-point of our revised FY24 revenue guidance range is over 100%. With our record setting revenue and backlog, we are positioned well for another record setting growth year in fiscal 2024. Now I'd like to turn things back to, Wahid.\nWahid Nawabi: Thanks, Kevin. With a record backlog of orders and after a very strong first quarter, we're increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2024 as follows. We anticipate revenue of between $645 million and $675 million. We anticipate non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of between $117 million and $127 million representing about 18% of revenue. Net income guidance remains unchanged at $51 million to $59 million or $1.91 to $2.21 per diluted share. This is primarily due to increased R&D investments in support of our strong growth. Non-GAAP earnings guidance also remains unchanged between $2.30 and $2.60 per diluted share. We expect R&D investments to be closer to 12% of revenue this fiscal year. As a reminder, we expect a more balanced revenue distribution with roughly 50% of new revenues expected to occur in each half of this fiscal year. We now have nearly 100 visibility to the midpoint of our revised revenue guidance. While we are confident in our ability to achieve our guidance, there are also numerous factors at play. This includes working with suppliers to scale their business to match our needs as well as securing long lead items. We remain well positioned to deliver nearly 20% growth in revenue, higher margins and overall improved bottom line results. The investments we're making this year should also position the company for continued growth in years to come. While the overall geopolitical environment as well as battlefield trends towards significant greater use of unmanned platforms support our confidence in the future, were mindful that the U.S. government is nearing the end of its fiscal year. We, as with most defense contractors, now regularly assume that a continuing resolution is more likely than not, which could impact contract timing. However, I would say unequivocally that AV remains optimistic about our fiscal year 2024 given broad support for our systems and services. We believe the current administration will continue to provide the necessary budget dollars and prioritization for the type of mission critical unmanned systems we supply, particularly in contested environment operations. We are at the forefront of developing and offering in-demand solutions for autonomy, automatic target recognition and tracking. In addition, the U.S. DoD is investing more in Loitering Munitions and small unmanned systems areas where we are well positioned to thrive. Now let me once again summarize the key points from todayâ€™s call. First, we delivered record first quarter results, which provides a solid start to fiscal year 2024. Second, our record funded backlog remains at historic levels, reflecting strong global demand for solutions. Third, the acquisition of Tomahawk Robotics will further improve the outlook for interconnected unmanned solutions and opens new avenues for growth across our product portfolio. And fourth, overall, the fundamentals of our business look better than ever they have in our history and we're well positioned to continue our growth trajectory as Congress begins laying the groundwork for the fiscal year 2024 budget. Before turning the call over to questions, we're also excited to welcome Admiral Phil Davidson to our Board of Directors. Admiral Phil Davidson brings extensive knowledge of battlefield operations especially in the Indo Paycom theatre and the deployment of new defense capabilities. We look forward to the unparalleled strategic council and vision he will bring to AV. I would also like to thank Katharine Marigold for her eight years of service on our Board of Directors as she is stepping down at our upcoming annual meeting. Her passion for and interest in our company's future were instrumental to our success during her tenure. And as always, my appreciation to our workforce goes without saying. Without such a dedicated and talented team of professionals, we would not have the market leading position powered by the cutting edge technological advancements that we enjoy today. We appreciate all our employees every day just as we do our long standing investors and other stakeholders in the company. The future continues to look bright and we believe fiscal year 2024 will drive the company to new heights. And with that, Kevin, Jonah and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction]. Our first question comes from the line of Gregory Konrad from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGreg Konrad: Good evening and great quarter.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Greg.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just to start on the outlook, I mean, the revenue outlook. It's a pretty big raise one quarter in. Can you maybe just talk about what's changed since last quarter, has there been some risk retirements? Is it orders and just kind of what's driving that better revenue outlook for the year?\nKevin McDonnell: Sure. So, we're very pleased with how great our team performed on the first quarter, Greg. There are several factors why we raised out our guidance for full fiscal year 2024. One is, we've had a tremendous first quarter, and our first quarter, this is historic first quarter for the company. Second, our backlog, as you saw, is at a historic levels also, we have another record on top of a record that we achieved this Q1. And then our visibility to the midpoint of our revised guidance is nearly at 100%. So, you can look at that and say based on our inventory position and ability for us to be able to secure long lead items, we feel fairly strong that at this time, we can achieve the revised guidance range that we provided. The demand for solutions remain very healthy, both domestically and abroad And I think the whole aerospace and defense industry is in a point of inflection when it comes to small unmanned systems. As a distributed architecture of warfare as well as Loitering Munitions, both categories, which we have essentially invented in the marketplace over the last two decades. So, we're positioned extremely well. The demand seems to be very strong even beyond fiscal 2024 and, we felt that at this time, we should raise our guidance to be able to achieve the higher levels of revenue outlook on the top line that we provided.\nGreg Konrad: And then maybe just a follow-up. If you can talk about Tomahawk a little bit, you had Progeny and just kind of how you view the shift from maybe hardware to more software and integration? And how you think about that kind of expanding the addressable market as you get more into kind of control and software side versus the hardware?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure. I'm glad you asked that question, Greg, because it's a really important point to make here. There are several reasons why we decided to acquire Tomahawk. which we have known by the way for many, many years. We work with them in the past, as I mentioned on my remarks, and we know the technology, the products and their talents very, very well. It's very similar to the Progeny Systems. There's a few key reasons I want to highlight. One, the overall customer trends are when the war fighters are overwhelmed with so many robotic systems, small, medium, large, extra-large, etcetera, etcetera, Loitering Munitions, ground robots, etcetera. It becomes very difficult for an war fighter to be able to carry multiple ground control stations and tablets and devices to control multiple UAVs. So, what Tomahawk does, it allows not only AeroVironment robotic systems, but also any other brand of robotic systems, to be able to simply integrate together in the battlefield to simplify the life of our customers, meaning a war fighter. In addition to that, it also enables a whole bunch of AI enabled features and technology, which we have been investing and they're investing in as well. So, one thing that really not well known about our offering is that we've been investing in this category of autonomy, GPS denied operations, contested battlefield environments, like the ones that we see and witness every day in Ukraine, AeroVironment has been investing in this area for several years. And we expect that to continue and we're positioned extremely well on that. So, what Tomahawk does, it helps us accelerate that deployment and adoption and to meet the customer's need, well better than anybody. So, there are several reasons it's a growth acquisition. It allows us to grow further and faster and allows us to deliver more value to our customers in order to simplify their what I call ecosystem and environment when they're operating multiple UAVs. Obviously, we just signed and we're going to close this quarter. We expect to close it this quarter and we'll provide more color on the financials at that time.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome, Greg.\nOperator: And one moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Arment: Yeah, thanks so much. Good afternoon, Wahid and Kevin, terrific results.\nWahid Nawabi: Thank you, Peter.\nPeter Arment: Wahid, just a question on the -- I don't think we've ever seen you have a report, 78% of the mix just kind of in the quarter for products. And I'm just wondering, just given how well your backlog is hitting new record levels, is this just kind of what we should expect going forward throughout this year, just thinking about service versus product?\nWahid Nawabi: Peter, as I said in my remarks, yes, we expect the product mix as a percentage of revenue to be more favorable towards products as it was in our Q1. And as you know, that product sales generally because we invest our R&D in our products and we sell them as majority of them, not all of them, as a commercial item, we enjoy a higher gross margin, in that regard, because we invest in it and it's justified to our customers. So, for the remainder of this year, we expect the gross margin percentage and the mix of revenue to be more favorable towards product sales than services for fiscal year 2024.\nPeter Arment: That's helpful. And then just on the backlog, the record backlog, can you maybe talk a little bit about how the FMS activity that you're seeing and just the opportunities there. I know you've been able to expand the, the, the countries that Switchblade is available for. And, of course, you've had a huge installed base in the small UAS category internationally, but how is FMS activity we think about going forward?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure. So, overall, our backlog, as you know, as I mentioned is at a record level again. We had a record backlog entering first quarter of fiscal 2024, last quarter in our earnings call. And we actually built beat that or increased that by almost another $100 million this quarter. It is phenomenal how well we've been performing in terms of, securing orders and working on growing our backlog. Many additional FMS cases remain, not to be in contract yet, from our many allies for Loitering Munitions. We believe that over the next several quarters and maybe even beyond fiscal 2024. We will see more countries placing orders and contracting these, the demands that they have and the needs they have for Loitering Munitions. The Ukraine conflict has essentially put an exclamation mark on how effective and important small Unmanned systems and Loitering Munitions are for a near peer kind of a conflict. The one that they are facing with Russia. So our systems have been incredibly vital and I believe that this is an inflection point as we go into multiple years beyond now. This is something that we work for very hard as a company. We've been saying this for a long time. We believe in this value proposition of our solution. And I think our customers are starting to realize that and that's accelerating their needs and requirements for acquiring those sorts of things. So in short, backlog is very strong for this year. We expect that to remain strong throughout the whole year. And I believe that many additional FMS cases for Switchblade 300 and 600, remains to be not contracted yet. It's going to be contracted in the future. Those cycles take a little longer, but there's a very healthy pipeline that's being built, as we progress throughout this fiscal year, which will help us in future years.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome, Peter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC. Your line is open.\nKen Herbert : Yeah. Good afternoon. Hey, Wahid. I wanted to see if I could start out and ask a question on the backlog again. Is it possible to parse out how much of the growth in backlog is maybe direct with U.S. aid to Ukraine versus maybe international customers or other U.S. domestic opportunities?\nWahid Nawabi: Ken, unfortunately, because of customer sensitivity, I'm not able to go further deeper into the colors of the backlog and what, but I what I could say is that in general, our backlog is really strong in all three of our business segments. Our Unmanned Systems segment, our Loitering Munitions segment and our MacCready Works segment. So, we have seen significant growth in all of them. The backlog for Loitering Munitions is made up primarily because we only sell those to the U.S. government, including for international opportunities, U.S. DoD has so far decided to sell those requests all through an FMS or U.S. AI case, FMS cases coming through the U.S. army. So really the contracting office that handles our Switchblade family of systems for both domestic and international customers has been and remains to be the U.S. military and U.S. army. The mix of customers in that area is pretty broad. I'm not able to comment on a specific contract or the amounts of them because of the sensitivity of the conflict that we have around the world and our customers. But it's healthy across the board. And I believe that it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable next this year and beyond, hopefully as well. Because, as I said, we'll continue to build on our momentum That's one of our fundamental goal, and priority last several years to continue to build our backlog to also level load our revenue based on a quarterly basis. And as you could see, we expect this year to be nearly fifty-fifty between first half and second half of the year, primarily because of our backlog.\nKen Herbert : That's great. Thanks, Wahid. And if I could, there's been a lot of press recently around some newer starts within the United States whether it'd be the Vaso program or replicator or others. I'm not sure how much you could talk about these, but can you maybe just talk about how well you believe you're positioned from some of the newer efforts, with the U.S. army and the Marine Corps and other parts of the U.S. government on some of these new competitions and how meaningful they can perhaps be in â€˜24 and fiscal â€˜25 for you?\nWahid Nawabi: So, Ken, I could not agree more with you in terms of the relevance of these large, very high priority focus areas for the U.S. DoD. You mentioned a couple, Lasso that's been recently been announced by the U.S. Army. We're tracking all of these. We're engaged with our customers very closely. One of the things that we pride ourselves is that we spend a lot of energy making sure that we're very, very close an intimate to our customers so we can solve their problems the best way possible better than anybody. And some of these requirements are squarely focused around the area that we as a business are offering as a pure play player. There's no one on this planet that I can think of that has the breadth and the depth of our portfolio when it comes to unmanned systems and robotics. So, the replicator, which was just recently announced by the U.S. DoD and Pentagon, is very much another example of the type of capabilities that are defense customers, U.S. DoD specifically, is looking to sort of acquire over the next several years that's very much focused around our system. So, I think we're positioned really well. I believe we will be able to participate in these opportunities. The details of that, of course, I'm not able to disclose right now because it's quite early and sensitive to our customer's operations and business.\nKen Herbert : Thanks, Wahid.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. And our next question will come from the line of Bryce Sandberg from William Blair. Your line is open.\nBryce Sandberg: Wahid, Kevin and Jonah. Good afternoon.\nWahid Nawabi: Good afternoon.\nBryce Sandberg: Wahid, you referenced how the $176 million Ukraine Puma IDIQ is nearly fully drawn. Do you expect to be able to renew this contract?\nWahid Nawabi: So, the answer is we are already engaged on additional contracts. So the short answer is yes. Is it going to be exactly the same type of contract and the same exact amount? No. But there's definitely a lot of demand for our system for Ukraine. As you all know, as I mentioned before, Ukraine has made many public statements that our Puma system is the workhorse in Ukraine and our Switchblade family systems is also one of their very critical capabilities that has helped them defend their nation and defend their independence against Ukraine so far. I believe that that's going to continue, we are engaged with the U.S. DoD on a very, very close and regular basis. There are several additional requests for our systems and the U.S. DoD is working with us to be able to fulfil those needs as they see appropriate. As you can see, some of that is also in fact, reflected our backlog today. So, the strong backlog does include additional orders for our unmanned systems in small UAS as well as Loitering Munitions. But I expect that to grow and continue to expand over the next several quarters as we move forward because I think that, as I said, there's an inflection point. Many of these countries, including Ukraine, want to have more and more of our types of systems, which are far less expensive than much more expand other platforms and they're much more effective in what they're trying to do and how they're fighting their conflict with Russia.\nBryce Sandberg: Great. Thanks, Wahid.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Your line is open.\nPete Skibitski : Nice quarter guys.\nWahid Nawabi: Thanks, Pete.\nPete Skibitski : I guess, Wahid, you touched in your opening comments, I think, supply chain issues. Can you update us on what you're seeing in terms of, as you're ramping volume issues with GUIs, any other components that you're having whose lead times are extended?\nWahid Nawabi: So, Pete, we believe that the revised guidance we gave, we're in pretty -- we're confident that based on our indicators today, we're going to be able to achieve the revised increased guidance on the top line. We have secured pretty much most of our long lead items. And as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we have intentionally raised our inventory levels to some extent, primarily because our systems are in high demand and sense of urgency, but within our U.S. DoD as well as our allies is very high. As soon as they contract with us, they would like us to deliver the systems. So, it's never a perfect situation. The supply chain is a game of, I call it a [whack a mole] (ph) game. Every day, every week, there's some sort of a new issue. But overall, we have handled this and managed this extremely well throughout the entire years of the COVID pandemic, the supply chain constraint, etcetera. So, for fiscal 2024, overall, we're in a very good position. and but there's challenges that arise every day and we try to address them. And we've actually done a really good job of managing those things. Another challenge that we are also facing, that we're tackling is not only do we have to manage the supply chain and making sure the parts are there, our revenue has grown considerably over the last two or three years. And with this growth, we need to also make sure that we bring up the production capacity of some of our smaller suppliers. And that is something that doesn't happen overnight. And it requires effort in our part, and for them to increase capacity, they've got to scale up their production and their manufacturing in their operations. And we're working with many of them that are strategic to us to make sure that we don't have any bottlenecks. And I'm very pleased with the progress that our team is making, and we've made it a concerted effort and focus for ourselves as a priority as a Company and a leadership team to focus on that for the last three to four years. And I think that is starting to pay dividend for us as we see the kind of growth that we've been able to achieve and deliver to, for our shareholders.\nPete Skibitski : Okay. I appreciate it. And last one from me, on the Tomahawk deal, my question is why buy this company. It's fairly young, right? Only five years old. Why buy them instead of maybe team with them on an ongoing basis or some other business arrangement? It's -- this whole area of ground control systems, it's, I guess you would have to have a comfort level that their IP is so high that it would -- other competitors would have a hard time overcoming that. Can you share your thoughts on why you pulled the trigger on this deal?\nWahid Nawabi: Sure. So as you said, that's a very good question, Pete. One, we've known them for many, many years. And we've known them since their founding days, and in fact. So, I personally known that one of the founders, through the industry, of course, for a long time. The reason why we did this is because it allows us to accelerate and achieve our growth objectives faster for ourselves as well as for our customers. As an independent company, while they continue to work with us, we won't be getting the level of priority and preferential treatment as we would like because at the end of the day, it's all about the mission of more customers, the war fighters. And most of our customers have already chosen to go down the path of selecting their system, Tomahawk systems as the open architecture to connect multiple unmanned and manned devices. So think about a battlefield where there are tanks, armored vehicles, ground robots, UAVs, etcetera, USVs, and you need to make sure that you provide a common operating picture for the operator, for the warfighter. And so, what Tomahawk does it brings all those things and it connects them and integrates them and also introduces a lot of predictive AI feature set. So in order for us to deliver those capabilities to our customers faster and also integrate deeper in terms of our product roadmaps, technology investments, we felt that the acquisition was the better way to go. And lastly, I would say we're also growing in terms of our talent. Tomahawk Robotics is primarily based out of Florida and it's an area that weâ€™d like to get access to more talent. So their site in Florida allows us to expand our workforce outside of California and areas where they're closer to our customers. So there are several reasons, their talent base, their IT, their product, their progress with customers, as well as ability to support our growth in the years to come. So, I really feel strongly that this is a very good decision for our Company or shareholders. It's also a great outcome for our customers. So far the feedback has been very positive and it positions us to basically marry the best, the most ubiquitous unmanned systems provider, which is AeroVironment, with the most advanced common controller technology enabled by AI from Tomahawk to be an integrated system solution for our customers.\nPete Skibitski : Okay. Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nWahid Nawabi: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jonah Teeter-Balin for any closing remarks.\nJonah Teeter-Balin: Great. Thank you once again for joining today's conference call and for your interest in AeroVironment. As a reminder, an archived version of this call, all SEC filings and relevant news can be found under the Investors section of our website. We wish you a good evening and look forward to speaking with you again following next quarter's results.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
