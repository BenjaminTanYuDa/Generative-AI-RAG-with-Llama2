Good morning. Thank you all for joining today's call. As previewed last month, Orion's third quarter revenue rose 28%, reflecting an anticipated acceleration in contract activity on large LED lighting projects in the government sector, projects secured through energy service company or ESCO partners and projects with our largest customer. Q3 also saw growth in our electrical maintenance services business, which is benefiting from a new three-year agreement with Orion's largest customer. Our Voltrek EV charging solutions revenue was flat with a year ago period and down on a sequential basis, principally due to the variability and timing of larger projects. We are, however, seeing very encouraging progress in the build-out of our longer-term EV charging project pipeline as we engage with new and existing customers to address their EV charging requirements. Our business development progress makes us optimistic about our growth prospects across the business in quarter four and fiscal '25. In LED lighting, we have several larger retrofit projects that are underway and should contribute to growth over the next few quarters. These include the remaining $6 million in revenue from our European retrofit project for the U.S. Department of Defense, several million in annual revenue for external lighting for the next several years to support our largest customer as well as other potential projects with them. Ongoing retrofits for a large global warehouse and logistics customer, which we expect to range from $8 million to $9 million per annum for the next few years and a large multimillion dollar project for a global technology customer, which we expect to begin in the first half of fiscal '25. In our LED business, we see continued expansion through our ESCO channel partners who continue to focus on our industry-leading high-efficiency lighting products as well as our new line of value-oriented fixtures, including our TritonPro retrofit high bay lighting fixtures and our Harris exterior LED lighting products. These products strike a balance between our commitment to high-quality components, design and energy efficiency and the budget limitations of some end customers. These new products expand our total addressable market within the ESCO and distribution channels. As an example, we recently won and are implementing a project for a national specialty retailer through an ESCO partner using TritonPro. Due to the customer specifications, TritonPro was the appropriate product to meet their needs. This project should generate revenue of $3 million to $4 million for Orion over the next 24 months. We continue to work on our electrical contractor channel to increase our value proposition by adding the right partners, products and pricing to meet their needs. We have seen excellent quoting and pipeline build in this channel since we launched the TritonPro and our exterior Harris lines. Reflecting the strategic benefits of our U.S. manufacturing facility here in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in the third quarter, Orion released a full line of new LED lighting fixtures compliant with the Build America, Buy America or BABA Act. These include energy-efficient LED high bays, LED strips and LED troffers. These fixtures exceed the requirements of both the earlier Buy America Act and the new BABA Act which mandates at least 55% of material content come from U.S. sources. That the BABA Act stipulates that states, municipalities and schools use BABA compliant products when possible in order to receive federal funding. Certainly, it's important to us to be a leader in American manufacturing in the lighting industry, but it also unlocks federal funding opportunities for customers that can significantly increase their ROI and support their sustainability goals. In November, we attended the Federal Small Business Conference in Texas to showcase our BABA compliant products. We have received great interest from customers and our quoted pipeline is already over $1 million and growing. One additional area that should be noted is that there are now seven states which are banning fluorescent fixtures for commercial and industrial use over the next several years. Our understanding is that these states, including California, will prohibit new fluorescent fixtures from being sold as well as prohibit replacement fluorescent tubes. We have heard from several customers that these requirements are motivating them to accelerate their timings on retrofit projects into the next 12 to 18 months. Turning to our EV charging solutions business. We have made good progress in building out the Voltrek team and its geographic reach to meet the needs of large national customers. We are now engaged with a broader base of customers and opportunities, which are contributing to growth in our project pipeline, which is now in excess of $50 million. Quarter three revenue of $2.8 million matched prior year quarter three, but was down slightly from last quarter due to project timing. We do anticipate some variability in quarter-over-quarter performance of this segment due to the timing of what we expect will be larger regional and national projects. As you probably know, there has been some recent reporting on potential pushback in the EV space by auto dealers and rental car companies as well as questions about the forecast of EV growth reaching 50% of the new vehicle fleet by 2030 or 80% by 2040. While some of the earlier projections might prove to be a bit bullish it is clear that EV shipments are continuing at a significant rate and our communities and enterprises are very much behind in building out the needed infrastructure to support the current and future needs of EVs. Voltrek with its over 14 years of experience and impressive track record of EV charging station deployments is extremely well positioned to serve customers in this area. Voltrek's experience and capabilities are even more compelling when compared to the many industry newcomers with little or no technical or EV charging deployment experience required to plan, deploy safe, successful and reliable EV charging solutions. Now turning to our maintenance services business, which achieved solid revenue growth year-over-year and sequential margin improvement in the third quarter. The improvement was attributable to the contribution of a new three-year agreement to provide preventative lighting maintenance services for our largest customers approximate 2,000 retail locations nationwide. Our performance also reflects the benefit of our effort to secure price increases with key customers. Given a range of significant inflationary pressures over the past several quarters, many of these older contracts were no longer profitable. In response to higher costs, we have raised our pricing to bring our profit margin more in line with our overall business. Over the past few quarters, we have worked to reprice legacy contracts and have successfully converted three of our four customers to our new pricing structure within contracted periods. Because we are committed to returning this business to a solid margin profile, we are prepared to exit relationships where we are unable to secure adequate pricing and margins. Many of our Stay-Lite legacy customers have their three-year maintenance RFP processes in our current quarter four period, so we do expect some revenue headwinds as we move into fiscal '25 in our maintenance segment as we continue to focus on profitability. Overall, we believe that maintenance services offers key accounts additional value and provides Orion with recurring revenue. We are active in our business development efforts and have new business in our pipeline that we believe could come to fruition in the first half of our fiscal '25. Having touched on each of our product and service offerings. I want to reiterate Orion's focus on delivering the highest quality, energy efficiency and value to our customers with the highest levels of customer service. Our complementary go-to-market approaches of working with ESCOs and distribution partners, along with our unique turnkey solutions allow us to participate in a broad segment of the overall market. Our turnkey approach starts with visits to each site and progresses to custom project and product design, configuration and project planning, including utility and government rebates. We then can manufacture the LED fixtures or procure the EV charging hardware from industry-leading partners and manage delivery, permitting, installation and commissioning at hundreds or even thousands of sites. All with just one point of contact and accountability. Our initiatives to diversify the business over the past two years are starting to make meaningful contributions to our growth from both new and existing customers. We continue to see significant cross-selling opportunities, particularly with long-standing large national account customers with potential needs across each of our three areas of operation. A priority in coming quarters is to effectively market each of our capabilities across our combined customer base. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our expanded array of solutions to support meaningful long-term growth in fiscal '25 and the years to come. Now I'll turn the call to Per Brodin to discuss our financials and financial outlook in more detail.\nPer Brodin: Thank you, Mike. As noted in today's press release, our Q3 '24 revenue of $26 million grew 28% year-over-year and 26% sequentially from Q2 of this year. Driven by anticipated strength in LED lighting and maintenance services. In prior calls, we noted several larger projects that we expected to ramp meaningfully in the second half. We began to benefit from that ramp in Q3. One of those projects is the $9.6 million Department of Defense project in Europe, which we had expected to complete this fiscal year. At this point, we have approximately $6 million remaining on this contract. We think approximately $1 million or more of that amount could roll over into early fiscal '25. Maintenance services revenue rose to $4.6 million in Q3 '24, which compared favorably to $3.3 million in Q3 '23 and $3.6 million in Q2 '24. A significant portion of this growth came from our 3-year agreement for preventative lighting maintenance services for our largest customers, roughly 2,000 retail locations nationwide. So those were the growth drivers in the quarter. In terms of profitability, our gross profit percentage or gross margin increased 95 basis points to 24.5% in Q3 '24 from 23.6% in Q3 '23 due to the achievement of a more favorable sales mix of products, the impact of higher sales volume on fixed cost absorption and improved margin on services. Gross margin on services rebounded sharply to 18.5% in Q3 from slightly negative in Q2 '24 and 17.6% in Q3 '23. We expect further margin benefits driven by the continued impact of new pricing on renewing contracts in coming quarters. Gross margin on Orion products improved approximately 220 basis points to 27.7% in Q3 '24 from 25.4% a year ago. The increase is attributable to new product sales as well as the benefit of higher volumes on fixed cost absorption. Reflecting steps taken in the maintenance business and our expectations for the business overall, we expect our blended gross margins to remain strong in Q4. Operating expenses declined to $8.4 million in Q3 '24 versus $9.4 million in Q3 '23 and $8.7 million last quarter. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to a lower earnout accrual in the current quarter and to acquisition expenses that occurred in the prior year period. Looking at the bottom line, we reported a Q3 '24 net loss of $2.3 million or $0.07 per share as compared to a net loss of $24.1 million or $0.75 per share which included a 56% shared noncash tax charge to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Q3 '23. On a comparable basis, last year's net loss would have been approximately $6.3 million or $0.19 per share, excluding the adjustment. Cash generated from operations was approximately $1 million in Q3 '24, reflecting improved operating results and net positive working capital changes. On December 31, we had current assets of $45.7 million, which included inventory investments of $20.8 million, accounts receivable of $15.7 million and cash of $5 million. Net working capital was $15 million and our financial liquidity, defined as cash and revolver availability was $17.5 million. As such, we believe we are in a good position to fund our operations and growth goals moving forward. As a reminder, last month, we updated our revenue expectations for fiscal 2024 to a range of $90 million to $95 million, representing growth in the range of 16% to 23%. On a preliminary basis, we are targeting growth of 10% to 15% for fiscal '25, and we will update this outlook when we report our full year results in June. And with that, I'll ask the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Amit Dayal from H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.\nAmit Dayal: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Jenkins: Good morning.\nAmit Dayal: Hey, guys. On the EV side, a little bit of a drop sequentially. Was it seasonality? Or are there any other factors driving some of the quarterly variance from that segment?\nMike Jenkins: Yes, good question. It was just really how the projects laid out in the quarter. Project timing overall. We continue to see, as I referenced in the comments, our project pipeline continues to build now north of $50 million in the overall pipeline. And we really haven't seen any substantial pushouts or anything out or anything along those lines due to concerns about the broader EV market.\nAmit Dayal: Okay. The $50 million pipeline you mentioned, is this all Northeast? Or is it spread across the U.S.?\nMike Jenkins: No, it's spread across the U.S. It's out of the Northeast. So we're beginning -- we've begun our cross-selling work with our existing lighting customers, and we're gaining traction in multiple states around the country.\nAmit Dayal: Okay. And then your comments around focusing on higher margin customers and higher-margin revenues. How much of the sort of lower margin revenues could be impacted by this shift in strategy? Is it a small amount that is not very meaningful? Or is it larger number that we should sort of -- can make an impact on the model projections.\nMike Jenkins: Specifically, we were referring to the maintenance business, the legacy maintenance business, which was acquired with Stay-Lite. And so right now, we're working -- that's the focus. We're working through those RFPs in this quarter. So we really don't have any specifics in terms of what that could look like, but it's isolated really to the business that we acquired with Stay-Lite in the maintenance side.\nAmit Dayal: Okay. Understood. Maybe just last one for me. For fiscal '25, what kind of revenue mix between lighting, maintenance and EV should we be looking for.\nMike Jenkins: Well, we projected 10% to 15% guided in terms of growth for the year. We are expecting continued growth in lighting and stronger performance in EV. And the maintenance business we'll see how things are going to play out with these couple of customers through the RFP process. But certainly, growth in lighting and strong growth in EV.\nAmit Dayal: Okay. I'll take my other questions offline, guys. Thank you so much.\nMike Jenkins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.\nEric Stine: Hi Mike, hi Perr. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMike Jenkins: Hey, Eric.\nEric Stine: So curious, I know with your large customer, I mean you all know who it is, with your large customer, you've clearly expanded beyond the retrofit of the footprint to the maintenance now? I know that they are very interested on the EV side. Just curious if you're seeing that dynamic with other national accounts where you are starting to see that expansion beyond just your -- I mean, I guess, it's your legacy business of the core LED retrofit.\nMike Jenkins: Yes. Great question, Eric. Yes, we are. I mean I think that there's interest on certainly the EV front with a broad swath of our customers. And all of -- particularly our large public customers. A lot of those are considering their electrification strategy moving forward to support their guests, their employees and, in some cases, electrifying their fleet. So we are having conversations with a broad group of them. Some of them, the maintenance services might apply to, particularly retail customers who don't have maintenance staffs in their locations. That's really where our value proposition probably is strongest. And so there are conversations happening there as well. So we see all three of these pillars continuing to work moving forward from a cross-selling standpoint.\nEric Stine: Got it. And then just coming back to the initial outlook here for fiscal '25. So I mean, basically, it's your implied fourth quarter the midpoint and you're annualizing that. But if you dig down into that, I mean, so you expect to be done, largely done with the DoD project. And is it fair to say that you are not assuming the renewal at better pricing with that fourth customer on the maintenance side?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. We certainly agree that our projections are that we'll be substantially complete with the DoD project. On the maintenance side, we feel like we've taken reasonable considerations into the forecast.\nEric Stine: Okay. And then as we think about that DoD project? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but you are kind of qualified. I know that you still have to go through the RFP process, but maybe talk about that pipeline as well, whether it's something that there are things out there that could replace the project you've completed as you get into '25 or just more about the long-term outlook.\nMike Jenkins: Sure. Absolutely. Yes. The federal space is one that's of keen interest to us. We do have a significant pipeline that has been built over the years and continues to be acceleratingly built right now, both on the lighting side as well as on the EV front, and that's both working with partners like we are in the DoD situation and in some cases, on a direct basis.\nEric Stine: Got it. I mean is there a way to think about what's the most typical form partners were...\nMike Jenkins: Typically, we're working through it. Yes, typically, we're working through an ESCO partner who would do kind of the entire project including HVAC and other elements. And we are the lighting specialists who basically manage that, and we often manage that in a turnkey fashion.\nEric Stine: Okay. Does that do anything to your kind of visibility into what's out there? I suspect it's something where you're working with certain partners and you kind of I would think would have a view of what the potential is out there.\nMike Jenkins: Yes. We review the long-term projects, and we have a significant pipeline that's built up with core partners.\nEric Stine: Okay, thanks a lot.\nMike Jenkins: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from BJ Cook from Singular Research. Your line is now open.\nBJ Cook: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of things here I want to touch. On the EV segment for just a second. You mentioned here in the short term that the timing of some of your larger projects, do you expect all or some of those projects just to kind of simply move to the next quarter?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. I think it's the next quarter and maybe the quarter after that, both near term, some of these things have been moved out a little bit. Again, I want to stress that we're not seeing any kind of broad reaction in the marketplace to any of the headlines that we've seen about the rental car companies or anything like that. This is just normal kind of project push out. That's the way I would describe them at this point.\nPer Brodin: Yes. A couple of things, BJ, that can impact timing as some of these customers are waiting for permitting and sometimes they're waiting for final grant approvals and they can't move forward without that. So there's a couple of things that just are kind of gatekeepers to certain projects just it can push things up part of a month, but it will cross over a quarter. So those are the kind of dynamics we're dealing with.\nBJ Cook: Got it. Appreciate that. I guess you also talked about $50 million plus pipeline in EV that's pretty impressive. I guess I'm kind of wondering if some of that comes from the infrastructure bill? Or maybe that's further down the road and there might be a benefit in addition to what you guys are doing internally?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. Good question. We're seeing that product build or that pipeline build rather, is coming from the organic Voltrek business, it's coming from cross-selling opportunities with our lighting customer. It's also coming from strategic partners like equipment providers that we work with and a true kind of partnership format and share opportunities there. So we've rapidly built that pipeline from several quarters back, it was approximately $30 million. So we've seen nice build on that. And again, the team is very focused on driving those through to converting those two wins and execution.\nBJ Cook: Just one more quick one. You guys are chatted about running off and renegotiating some of the legacy unprofitable maintenance business. I appreciate that. Can you at least give us a glimpse of what segment margins might look like on a normalized basis.\nPer Brodin: Yes. I think that's awfully hard to say too. A lot of it depends on our sales volumes, but we expect over time that things will be at a fairly normalized rate.\nBJ Cook: Great, thanks, I appreciate it guys.\nPer Brodin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bill Dezellem from Tieton Capital Management. Your line is now open.\nBill Dezellem: Hi, thank you. Back in January, in the middle of the month, I believe that the government awarded something like $150 million to repair existing EV charging stations. Was Voltrek involved in that process and if not, why?\nMike Jenkins: Hi, Bill, nice to hear from you. No, we have not seen that money flow through at this point in time. A lot of the funding from the federal government does take quite some time to work its way through. The NEVI funds is an example were approved probably about 18 months ago, 18 to 24 months as that funding is going to the states and now just kind of beginning to hit the street. So we have not benefited from that funding at this point in time.\nBill Dezellem: My impression, Mike, was these were actual awards that had taken place. Did I misread the announcement?\nMike Jenkins: Bill, I don't know the specifics of the announcement. I would have to go back and check on that.\nBill Dezellem: Okay. Let me continue down the EV path. The $50 million of pipeline that you referenced, how does that compare to 1 year ago?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. We were probably, I would say, around $30 million a year ago, maybe a little less. Actually less, yes. So it's built substantially.\nBill Dezellem: Congratulations. And then you referenced in the release and in your opening remarks that 10% to 15% growth anticipated next year. What do you currently see as the trajectory of how the year looks and really as much thinking rate of change, are you anticipating that each quarter is going to be roughly up 10% to 15%. Is it front-end weighted, back-end weighted? What's your general early read on that?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. Good question, Bill. Typically, this year and the years prior, we tend to be more back-end loaded as a company. It's the way kind of the timings of some of the projects and the capital cycle tends to work out. I think that the growth rate would be applied, let's say, at this point in time, and we haven't really given any specifics on this. But I would see quarter-over-quarter growth throughout the year, but we're probably going to still the way the quarters will lay out be a bit back-end loaded.\nBill Dezellem: So Mike, just to make sure I understand what you're saying there is that the rate of change that 10% to 15% is probably similar for each of the quarters. However, in an absolute dollar sense, the year will be back-end loaded just like it was this year and that's how we get the math to be up 10% to 15% each of the quarters.\nMike Jenkins: Yes. Good summary, Bill. Absolutely.\nBill Dezellem: Okay. Thank you. And then one additional question, please. You've referenced the large accounts and their interest in all three business segments. Talk a little bit more about that, if you would, please. And including to what degree this is new customers that are wanting to do a bundle of all three versus existing customers primarily and any additional insights you can share would be appreciated.\nMike Jenkins: Sure. I could use two examples of customers right now. One is a customer that we did a very large EV installation for. Our team, as they've worked with this customer has made them aware of our new exterior lighting products, which are available, the new Harris ones that we launched this past year. And so we're in the process. We quoted $0.75 million project -- lighting project for them. So that's an example of cross-selling, working from an EV standpoint, to lighting. On the other side, we have a long-standing manufacturing customer of ours, public company, multiple sites throughout the U.S. They're now getting through their strategy on electrification, which will include fleet for them. And we're engaging -- actively engaging with them in terms of helping them design their layouts and requirements as they move forward and then obviously, hope to move that to execution. So those are two examples of some of the cross-selling.\nBill Dezellem: And relative to the new customers versus existing, what you described is primarily existing, do you have any new customers that are coming to you or that you're finding that are right out of the gates, wanting to talk about doing all three aspects of your business, lighting, maintenance and EV?\nMike Jenkins: I think the reality is that new customers typically come to us about a pressing need in one of the three areas and that once the customer comes into the ecosystem, let's say, we cross-sell from there. That's typically the way it works.\nBill Dezellem: That's helpful. Thank you for the time.\nMike Jenkins: You bet. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Andrew Shapiro from Lawndale Capital Management. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Shapiro: Hi, thank you. You mentioned in your script three of four, I guess, legacy customers on the maintenance side have been converted to have their service contracts up at market prices rather than the money-losing lower price level. This last customer's contract, it runs off when? Is it during the current fourth quarter or sometime thereafter?\nPer Brodin: The end of April.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay, at the end of April. And are there margins at a loss in this? Or have you recognized like a fixed price defense contract, remaining estimated loss in the revenues generated from this contract going forward or just at zero margin? Or there is some embedded loss here?\nPer Brodin: No, there is an embedded loss. We do not have a reserve for future losses on that contract based on the nature of that contract. So as we work through the contract, at least the completion of the current contract, we would anticipate there's additional losses as netting against the other results within maintenance.\nAndrew Shapiro: Right. Yes. No, no, already seen the improvement. And someone had asked you the question and maybe you were just hesitant to provide the numerical range of sort. Someone asked you the question on what the normalized margins would be from this segment once the money-losing contract burns off and I didn't know, are you comfortable or are you able to provide a range or that was just something that you'd rather not for whatever competitive reason that provides?\nPer Brodin: Full transparency, I didn't quite hear the full question before. So we anticipate that business operating in the 20% margin range.\nAndrew Shapiro: And then are there any other smaller customers that you have in that segment that are also with these kind of fixed rate terms that have to burn off with smaller amounts of money loss? Or this is it?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. We've addressed all of the situation we have and are addressing all the situations, big or small, that need to be addressed from a margin standpoint.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay, excellent, thank you guys.\nMike Jenkins: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Steve Rudd from Blackwell. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rudd: Hi, I want to just focus on your last statement that you've addressed. You are addressing all the margin issues. And I appreciate the prior callers or questioners clarification on the fourth customer. On the three of the four customers that have not been -- that have been converted to the new pricing model with our better margins. What I want to understand is, are there contracts now fully -- the negative margin contracts fully done, just like you said, in April and fourth customers loss contract will be done. Is it that there's -- those other three customers, there are no more contracts with them that have these negative margins? Or is it simply that they're accepting prospectively on new contracts, better margins, but there's still contracts with them that have yet to work off with the negative margins.\nMike Jenkins: Yes. Good question and good ask for clarification. So we have -- to be clear, we have gone to these customers within contract periods and we have successfully repriced three out of the four. As also indicated in my comments earlier, this is the RFP season, let's say, for the majority of these accounts. So the majority of the RFPs are taking place now in our quarter four. And so therefore, we are -- as we suggested, some of these RFPs may not renew because of the profitability concerns that we have.\nPer Brodin: Another way to think about it, while the three of the four open the contract -- mid-contract, we did not extend those contracts. So they went back to the regular RFP cycle.\nSteve Rudd: Okay. And what I want to clarify here, it's interesting, and I'm glad you guys reached out to these three of the four customers. What's -- or to the four of four, but you had success with this three of the four. What's interesting to me was their willingness to reprice the existing contracts. And I think the implication there is that those contracts are no longer unprofitable. Is that, first of all, correct implication that these existing contracts with them are no longer unprofitable?\nMike Jenkins: Correct. The ones that have been repriced are profitable.\nSteve Rudd: And then the second half of that is with the customers' willingness to reprice those existing contracts, there's what I hear in your answer is an implication that the -- we probably won't be doing much more with a number of them, and that's kind of a strange outcome where, yes, we understand that we need to reprice. But no, we really don't see -- we don't see the model going forward. And I just don't -- I don't know how that lines up, but you see what I mean. We need to reprice our contract. But going forward, we really don't see ourselves doing much more business. Yes, I don't know how those two line up. Do you follow the conflict I'm trying to resolve?\nMike Jenkins: Sure. Sure. I understand. I would say that they understood the inflationary environment, and therefore, we negotiated our way to pricing within contract periods. Anytime you get into an RFP situation, it's a competitive situation. And so therefore, there's a lot of unknowable’s. What we do know is that we're not going to take on business which is not profitable. And if we end up shedding some of the revenue because of its unprofitable nature and especially for one of these situations, that will benefit us in the long-term.\nSteve Rudd: Okay. All right. And that's obviously the way to go. I do want to ask you one thing, though. Have you or do you have any ability in the marketplace to go forward on a cost-plus model because it seems to me that we got squeezed on our -- like everybody did on margins during the pandemic and the bottlenecks, et cetera. But your particular business, I think, might lend itself to a cost-plus model so that we reduce the risk that either we get our pricing wrong or that other exogenous events, which are floating around in massive possibility whack us yet again. So is that a possibility to cost plus?\nMike Jenkins: Unfortunately, that's not the way the industry works. And so it's basically a fixed price three year, and the customers are all use the same methodology. So we have to subscribe to that if we're going to end up doing business with them. So again, we feel like we've had some wins. We've had some contracts which have been won in some RFPs, which we've gotten pricing through which we feel good about. And but we do have some that we're in the midst of right now, which are unknowable, except for the fact that we're not going to take on unprofitable business. So that's what we've committed to, okay?\nPer Brodin: Pretty deep into the weeds, if you want to have a detailed conversation some time maybe you could reach out to the IR group, and we could schedule a separate call for that.\nSteve Rudd: Okay, we can do that. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nPer Brodin: Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes the Q&A session.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. As anticipated in our last call, Orion's business progressed in the second quarter with both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth of 17% and reflecting the revenue momentum we anticipated building as we progress through fiscal '24. September was our strongest month of the year and within our top 3 months since the start of fiscal '23 for both our Lighting business and our overall total. Per will discuss our Q2 performance and financial guidance a bit later in the call. Now I'd like to start by providing an overview of our strategy and performance across the business segments. Within our Lighting business, the $9.6 million Department of Defense European LED retrofit project began in earnest in Q2 with revenues of approximately $1.2 million, and we expect to complete the bulk of this project in the fiscal year. This project experienced some unexpected start-up issues working its way through the EU regulatory bodies, but is now in full swing, and we expect to catch up in the second semester of fiscal '24. We anticipate several other larger retrofit projects to contribute to the balance of this fiscal year, including a project for a global technology customer as well as continued growth from a long-term global warehouse logistics sector customer. We also expect meaningful revenue to come from an outdoor lighting project for Orion's largest customer. We feel good about our growing pipeline of lighting business. We also anticipate solid full year growth in LED lighting revenue from our ESCO and electrical contractor distribution channels. In fact, the technology customer retrofit project I just mentioned, was sourced through a relatively new ESCO partner. By their nature, ESCOs are focused on delivering energy savings and environmental benefits to their customers. LED lighting retrofits are right in the sweet spot of their value proposition as they provide significant quantifiable long-term energy savings and generally a full return on investment within 2 to 5 years. Our ESCO business was up 43% in quarter 2 and 38% for the first 6 months, which includes our expanded relationship with our large warehousing logistics customer, but excludes the DOD project, which was sourced through an international ESCO. We are continuing to build our base of productive agent and distribution channel relationships, focusing on partners who recognize the value of our high product quality leadership and energy-efficient performance and our commitment to the highest levels of customer service. To extend our penetration in our distribution channels, we recently launched a new line of more value-oriented products that incorporate the industry-leading design, quality and energy efficiency for which Orion is known within the trade. These new products include TritonPro LED retrofit high bay and other interior fixtures as well as an expanded line of Harris branded exterior LED lighting products. They were developed in response to requests for more competitively priced LED contractor-grade fixtures that incorporate Orion's strong design and product quality. Feedback has been very positive, and we've recorded over $1 million in revenue from these new products in quarter 2, their first quarter of availability. Our quoting activity has been strong, and we look to accelerate sales of these products in the second half of fiscal '24. Importantly, these products also provide a solid margin contribution. Also on the product front, we recently debuted several new products that are compliant with the Build America Buy America or BAA Act, and we expect that they will be well received by those customers who prefer U.S. manufactured products. BABA is a certification, which requires 55% or greater of material content and products to come from U.S. sources. The BABA standard was created as part of the federal IRA bill and that stipulates state, municipal and schools to use BABA compliant products when possible in order to receive federal funds. Orion is uniquely positioned to provide this product due to our U.S.-based manufacturing facility and capabilities. As you may know, over the past 24 months, we have diversified our business into 2 new complementary areas, which include electrical maintenance services as well as providing turnkey electric vehicle or EV charging station solutions. These new areas are well aligned with our core mission of helping customers achieve their business and sustainability goals while providing Orion with exciting cross-selling opportunities. Many of our customers had previously asked us about our ability to help them in these areas, which was a key factor in our decision-making to enter these spaces. We entered the commercial industrial EV charging solutions market in our third quarter of last year with the acquisition of Voltrek. We had a large bus project in quarter 4 of last year and then saw revenue dip sequentially in Q1 this year as we managed through Voltrek integration and the build-out of its sales and project management teams to support expanding revenues and a broader geographic reach. Our EV segment rebounded strongly in quarter 2, delivering $3.4 million of revenue versus no contribution in the year prior. We anticipate continued growth at Voltrek in the coming periods as the business capitalizes on its long-term track record of success, growing market interest in EVs throughout the U.S. and our ability to cross-sell these solutions with our strong base of customers and progress. Projections are 50% on the new vehicle fleet will be EVs by 2030 and 80% by 2040. Businesses everywhere are now considering their electrification and EV charging strategy to support their employees, customers and their own fleet needs. Orion is well positioned to help our customers and partners through this exciting and rapidly evolving journey. Our Maintenance Services business also delivered both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. We acquired Sealite Lighting in quarter 1 of last year, and with the acquisition came a number of multiyear contracts, some of which are now no longer profitable given a range of cost increases, including higher subcontractor costs that have occurred over the past several years. To address these inflationary pressures, we have updated our pricing for new and existing customers to better reflect our current cost structure. We've been working to renegotiate contracts as they came up for renewal, and we are making progress. We have renegotiated 3 out of 4 of our most significant legacy contracts and believe this effort will return maintenance to solid profitability as these new price levels continue to impact our results in the second half of fiscal '24. We recognize our pricing effort could result in the loss of some business and could therefore provide a modest near term revenue headwind for the segment. Nonetheless, there are plenty of growth opportunities in this space, and we believe that we can restore profitability while delivering high standards of service and great value to our customers. We recently finalized a 3-year preventative maintenance agreement with our historically largest customer. Orion will provide LED lighting and light electrical preventative maintenance services to our customers approximately 2,000 retail stores nationwide. The agreement formalizes and builds upon services we initiated in February and scaled through July. Overall, I am pleased with the progress we are making, though we still have work to do in terms of integrating our lines of business and pursuing expanded revenue opportunities. We are excited about our expanded array of solutions to offer customers and partners and are encouraged by their interest. We have already secured product sales and new projects through our cross-selling initiatives between all 3 of our segments. This remains an area of focus for the business that we believe we can deliver growth synergies as we move forward. In summary, we believe we are building a strong and diverse business for long-term success. We expect to see our total revenue accelerate across the business in the second half of fiscal '24, and as such, have reiterated our $100 million revenue guidance for fiscal '24. Now I'll pass the call to Per Brodin to discuss our financials and fiscal year outlook in more detail.\nPer Brodin: Thanks, Mike. Orion's Q2 '24 revenue improved 17% to $20.6 million from $17.6 million in Q2 '23, primarily reflecting bolster activity in the current quarter and maintenance revenue growth, which was partially offset by lower lighting revenues. Revenue also grew 17% on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter of fiscal '24. As discussed previously, we have several larger lighting projects, including the European DoD project and a large outdoor project, which we expect to ramp meaningfully in the second half of fiscal '24. We recognized $1.2 million of revenue on the Department of Defense project in Q2 '24, which leaves approximately $8 million of remaining revenue to complete this project. Our first half revenues rose 8% to $38.2 million from $35.5 million in the first half of fiscal '23. Our gross profit grew to $4.6 million from $4.4 million in Q2 '23 in spite for the decline in gross profit percentage. Notably, our gross profit margin improved on a sequential basis, reflecting the improved terms on 3 significant maintenance contracts and better absorption of fixed costs across all businesses. As Mike discussed, our gross profit percentage is being impacted by inflationary challenges over the past several quarters on legacy contracts in our maintenance business. During the quarter, we renegoniated pricing at 3 of 4 of our most significant legacy contracts, and we are working to update other legacy contracts as well. Our maintenance business also began benefiting from a new 3-year agreement to provide preventative maintenance services for our largest customer. In Q2, our efforts led to an improvement in service margin from negative 11.2% in Q1, although it's still slightly negative, we expect further margin benefits in the back half of this fiscal year, driven by the rollout of our new pricing. Gross margin on products improved approximately 250 basis points to 30.1% in Q2 '24 from 27.6% a year ago. This increase is attributable to new product sales and overall higher volumes benefiting fixed cost absorption. Reflecting the steps taken in our maintenance business and our expectation of growing sales volume in the business overall, we expect our blended gross margin to improve further in the second half of this fiscal year. Our Q2 operating expenses increased to $8.7 million from $7.4 million in Q2 '23, mainly due to the addition of Voltrek operations included $1.1 million earn-out accrual and $200,000 of intangible amortization related to the acquisition. Operating costs declined sequentially from $9.6 million in Q1 '24 due to lower compensation-related costs and a large credit write-off that occurred in Q1 '24. We recorded a Q2 '24 net loss of $4.4 million or $0.14 per share, including the Voltrek earn-out versus a net loss of $2.3 million or $0.07 per share in Q3. Cash used in operations a $4 million in Q2 '24, reflecting operating results in a $1.5 million Voltrek earn out payment, partially offset by positive net working capital effects. We achieved positive free cash flow in September and expect positive free cash flow over the balance of this fiscal year. At September 30, we had current assets of $45.3 million, which included inventory of $20.2 million, accounts receivable of $16.1 million and cash of $4 million. Working capital was $16.2 million at the close of Q2 '24 total current liquidity, including cash plus $8.9 million of revolver availability, was [$12.9 million]. We expect our liquidity position to improve in the second half of the fiscal year based on the expected ramp in revenues. In addition, we are looking at additional ways to enhance our liquidity, primarily through a potential mortgage on our corporate headquarters. As mentioned, in Q2, we started several larger projects and finalized a nationwide maintenance agreement. In addition, our backlog sits at $21.1 million in September 30. All of these things and more contribute to our full year revenue outlook. Reflecting these and other factors, we have reiterated our expectations for revenue growth of 30% or more in fiscal '24, complying total revenue of approximately $100 million. The achievement of this goal implies a meaningful revenue improvement in the second half of the year. Based on this growth expectation, we also expect a solid improvement of our second half bottom line performance. With that, I'll ask the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nEric Stine: So when thinking about the second half, you called out the DoD project, which has already started in the lighting project. So I guess I want to clarify if that started or when you expect that to start. But just curious, are there any other large projects that you would point to? And things that give you the confidence in that ramp, clearly, you're reiterating it, so you've got that confidence and just trying to gauge that.\nMike Jenkins: Sure. There are a number of things. So obviously, the DoD project, as we spoke about, we talked about an exterior project for our largest customer, which is all basically happening in the second half of this year moving forward. And that's a mid-7 figures kind of project and rollout. We do expect that our 2 customer, which we've disclosed, is a global logistics company and warehouse company. We expect that business to continue to scale as we move forward, which on a year-on-year basis will give us nice growth. And there are other -- the global technology project which we spoke about, we do expect to recognize revenue on that moving into the second half of the year. So there are a number of nice projects, which we expect activation shortly, some of which are already in flight and should scale.\nEric Stine: So the DoD 1 is already in -- that's already underway in the others. I mean fair to say you're waiting on, but there -- you've gotten good visibility into those starting?\nMike Jenkins: That's right. Yes and the DoD, we would have -- we were anticipating a bit more revenue in Q2. I referenced in my comments that we did experience some start-up issues getting through EU regulatory bodies. So that -- we view that miss basically to be caught up in the second half of the year.\nPer Brodin: And just for the math, Eric, that we did say we recognized $1.2 million of that in the second quarter. The total project is in the $9.6 million neighborhood. There was a few hundred thousand recognized in Q4 of fiscal '23. So there's about $8 million left that we expect the majority of that, virtually all of that to be recognized in the second half.\nEric Stine: And then on the maintenance contracts, and I know you said you've renegotiated 3 of 4, but you've got some others out there. I'm curious if you can kind of quantify how many others might be out there that you would look to renegotiate and then curious if you have the mechanisms that you've got in place now whether there's some variability to the contracts based on market conditions? Or are they just short enough in nature that it would just be kind of an ongoing renegotiation whenever they come up?\nMike Jenkins: Sure. Yes. As indicated on the last call, we were able to kind of off-cycle address pricing on a couple of these contracts. We have fully got renegotiated 3 out of our top 4, we have 1 major contract, which is still out there that we need to work on. . The way it works is basically we've renegotiated pricing and then all these accounts have their normal kind of RFP cycle. And so we will be working through that. And some of those are up as early as the beginning of our fiscal year -- early in our fiscal year.\nPer Brodin: And maybe, Eric, a little more context 4 large contracts really are the bulk of the piece of maintenance that is at State Light. So there are other miscellaneous contracts, but those 4 would represent the bulk of the revenue in that part of the segment.\nEric Stine: And so the last major 1 is that that's where you've kind of -- I mean, maybe to simplify, you presented them with the new pricing and now they go through a process and hopefully, in the RFP process you would win.\nMike Jenkins: Yes. I mean certainly, we're going through with all of them, and that's the 1 that's remaining. So yes, I mean, in principle, those are having conversations right now. So...\nEric Stine: Maybe last one for me. Just on the EV opportunity. I think I've asked this before, but just curious, obviously, your customers, many of them requested these capabilities from you. Do you expect this to be a decision that's by company over their footprint? Or is it more kind of a site-by-site decision?\nMike Jenkins: I think it can work both ways. I think it really depends on how they run their businesses and how centralized or decentralized they are as a company. I think some will go basically across the country. And we're having some conversations with folks like that and others, it will really depend on whether or not they have a fleet location out of that facility, et cetera. So I think it's going to work both ways.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal from H.C. Wainright. Your line is open.\nAmit Dayal: Just on the EV topic, is pipeline more sort of corporate and enterprise? Or is there some government-related opportunities as well?\nMike Jenkins: Yes, there certainly are both private and public opportunities. We currently do business with municipal governments. That's part of kind of the legacy of Voltrek as well as with private companies. And so we see growth in both areas. We were recently at a federal government trade show. And there was a tremendous amount of conversation about the electrification strategy of the federal government for their own use and facilities. So I think downstream, we're going to see rapid adoption in both areas.\nAmit Dayal: And then on the Voltrek earnout, could you remind us what remains to be paid out, et cetera?\nPer Brodin: Yes. We made the payment I referenced in September of $1.5 million toward the fiscal '23 earn-out, and then there was another $1.5 million paid in October towards that $3 million earn-out. There will then be the opportunity for a fiscal '24 earn-out, that amount would be paid in the second quarter of calendar -- second calendar fiscal '25 to the extent it's earned, that is a $3.5 million opportunity. And then the following year, there's a $4 million opportunity plus a kicker for a cumulative -- on cumulative EBITDA earnings over the first 3 years of ownership, which could be a max potential of an incremental $3.15 million that would be paid at the same time as the fiscal '25 earn-out opportunity.\nAmit Dayal: And then maybe just on the service and maintenance segment. I know you're going through a lot of sort of renegotiations, et cetera. But are you also actively trying to add new clients at this point? Or are you sort of trying to clear out your existing setup with the legacy contracts before you move to adding new customers?\nMike Jenkins: Sure. Well, we actually did add quite a bit of new business with our #1 customer, as we talked about on the preventative side for 2,000 locations. So that was a big add to the team in terms of new volume. So right now, we're certainly digesting that. We're building out and shoring up our resources around that. And then at the same time, focused on profitability for the legacy business. We do see growth opportunities out there, but we certainly want to approach this a bit step-by-step and address the profitability of the legacy business as our first order of priority right now.\nAmit Dayal: Once, if the service margin is normalized for you guys, how much of a lift should we expect to the overall blended margin?\nPer Brodin: Well, I think if you look at the blend, think about the blend of the margin, we expect to ultimately get back to what we've experienced as a more traditional service margin for that business. So that's not going to happen over the next quarter or so as we continue to renegotiate these contracts, but that's where we are certainly targeting that this business is headed.\nAmit Dayal: Okay. And I'll follow up on that 1 later. But that's all I have for now.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Rygiel from B. Riley Securities.\nMin Cho: This is Min Cho for Alex Rygiel. Can you hear me? Okay. That's so confusing because I logged in as myself. But okay, sorry about that. A couple of quick questions. Just given the interest rate environment, are you seeing any kind of project delays or just slowdown in bidding opportunities for some of the larger projects?\nMike Jenkins: At this point in time, we have not seen any sub-sequential delays that we could attribute to that not at all.\nMin Cho: Also in terms of your Voltrek business, it sounds like it's progressing fairly well here. Are you still on track to hit kind of a $10 million to $12 million in revenue for the full year. Can you talk a little bit about the pipeline? And maybe how big this business can get for you in the next couple of years?\nMike Jenkins: Sure. Yes. We did say earlier that we thought that between the Voltrek business and the maintenance business that it would be around 1/3 of the business overall. We still think we're on track for that, plus or minus. The $10 million to $12 million that you referenced for Voltrek given our current run rate coming out of this quarter, we definitely feel like that's achievable. And in terms of the longer view of Voltrek and the EV space more broadly, as I referenced in my comments, the macro environment remains very strong towards EVs. It won't be perfectly linear, but directionally strong. And we do see the opportunity to grow a business of $20 million to $50 million in the next couple of years.\nMin Cho: Excellent. And then it's nice to see that you reiterated your revenue guidance for the full year. Just any thoughts on EBITDA for the second half of this year. Can you exit on the positive EBITDA? And how do we get there?\nPer Brodin: Well, in my comment, I certainly mentioned that we expect our improved and increasing sales to [Indiscernible] line results. So we do expect, as I make it to be free cash flow positive, which I think implicit in that EBITDA positive as we leave the year. But say that our year-to-date performance would [Indiscernible] probably not finish the year with a net positive result.\nMin Cho: And then just one final question. I believe you had a large DoD contract for your Pure Motion product, and it was awaiting funding. Any update on that? Or any just update on some of your newer kind of I guess, more value-add products?\nMike Jenkins: Pure Motion, the project that you referenced is still live. It is still -- but it's basically on a hold status right now with the DoD. So we do expect that, that project will at some point move forward, but we don't have timing at this point in time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Shapiro from Lawndale Capital Management. Your line is open.\nAndrew Shapiro: Just trying to get drill down into this maintenance contract stuff and the losses. When you define a contract as a legacy contract, what do you mean? And when was State Light acquired?\nPer Brodin: By legacy contract, we mean it was something that was an existing customer of State Light when they were acquired. We acquired State Light effective January 1, 2023.\nAndrew Shapiro: So fairly recent and all that. Now -- [Multiple Speakers] okay? And these contracts I think you said in the last call when I asked questions, we're around 3 years or so in duration. So I guess that may be medium term to long term for this kind of business. What are you doing differently in your new maintenance contract bidding to share I guess, we'll call it margin risk or to mitigate this risk? Is it just that you're pricing it higher and hoping that you won't have another wave of inflation are you doing with a shorter duration on the pricing? How are you approaching it differently?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. So each of the customers have their own specifics around how you can tender and go through an RFP process. So we are confined by some of those protocols from the customer, clearly we would like to build in a reasonable level of escalation into our contracts, given the inflationary environment that we've experienced over the last couple of years, where that's not possible, then we have to take those inflationary challenges that are anticipated over the future into account when we go through the RFP process.\nAndrew Shapiro: In last call, I also had asked about, and I think you said at the time you were negotiating improvements and it looks like you got 3 out of the 4. And you said on the contracts that wouldn't amend the furthest the runoff would take you into the spring. So of those kind of contracts where they won't amend to allow for a price increase, et cetera, and that are going to expire later in the spring. Do you expect those customers to then renew at your higher and better terms? Or that's going to be kind of annualized revenue that you were generating that will not be added back in? And can you kind of give a range to help quantify or get our arms around, I guess, the amount of revenue from that subsegment that we wouldn't mind necessarily going away, but we shouldn't count on continuing?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. That is directionally correct. The number of these contracts are going to naturally expire in spring, actually in quarter 1 of our next fiscal year, some of them are at the end of April and in that time frame. So the renegotiations that we've done are basically for the current contract period, then we'll go through the cycle for the next round of RFPs. At this point in time, those are active conversations, which are starting, and I really have no guidance to provide on any of that as those are active conversations with customers.\nAndrew Shapiro: And like how large in terms of revenue is the whole State Light segment here that I guess includes a combination of profitable and unprofitable.\nPer Brodin: When we acquired State Light we disclosed that they were a $9 million to $10 million business.\nAndrew Shapiro: And the renegotiated ones, the ones that you opened up your inter period was this just to get to breakeven on those contracts or the pricing would provide for profitability at your normal margin or somewhere in between?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. Moving forward, it is our mandate to have these contracts be profitable. So not just breakeven.\nAndrew Shapiro: No, I understand that, Bill, in terms of the new ones. But right now, you've gotten some contracts amended inter-period before they expire and you got some improvement. But the improvement you got, did you get just to break even, did you get to your desired margin? Or did you get to somewhere in between?\nMike Jenkins: Yes. All of these contracts, the pricing changes that we're making will allow for the company to be profitable on these contracts. They are rolling out, so we don't recognize the change in all cases immediately because there's often a backlog and those types of things. So the full impact of these contract changes and pricing changes occur over time. But the goal and what we've implemented is for all these accounts to drive profitability.\nAndrew Shapiro: And 2 other follow-ups not on State Light. Voltrek, when does that acquisition anniversary? And remind me the earn-out targets are not just revenue based, but they're EBITDA based, right?\nMike Jenkins: So the anniversary of Voltrek just occurred this past month in October. So we've just now anniversaried it. And the earn-out is based on EBITDA, not on revenue.\nAndrew Shapiro: And the DoD contract profitability, as you build that thing out, the accounting on that, that's not like some kind of completion of contract type of accounting? Or is it.\nPer Brodin: I mean, to some degree, that's a decent way to think about it, it's based on installation of the fixtures, which is a decent analog for percentage of completion. So as we impacting multiple buildings on those bases. So it's as we install fixtures, we recognize the revenue.\nAndrew Shapiro: Lastly, you made a comment about potentially seeking a mortgage on the headquarters building. Of course, this is not the optimal time to go lock in some kind of long-term rate. When does your current bank line? What's its maturity date.\nPer Brodin: December of 25.\nAndrew Shapiro: And your pricing is what reference rate plus what? What's the margin on that?\nPer Brodin: [Indiscernible].\nAndrew Shapiro: And are we in the toughest band right now in light of the fact we're not generating positive EBITDA?\nOperator: And with that, this concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Jenkins for closing remarks.\nMike Jenkins: Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining and listening to our call today. I look forward to updating investors and stakeholders in coming months and quarters as we execute on our growth objectives for fiscal '24. We continue to take opportunities to meet with investors in person or virtually. We are presenting at the Sidoti & Company Virtual Conference on November 15, and I encourage you to listen to our presentation and/or to register for one-on-one call. For more information on our planned events or if you would like to schedule a call with management, you can contact our Investor Relations team whose information is in today's press release. Thank you very much. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

Good morning and thank you all for joining us this morning. While Q1 was a more modest quarter as previously suggested, we remain very confident in our pipeline of opportunities for the balance of the fiscal year, which we believe position us well to deliver meaningful growth over fiscal 2023. Our confident outlook is supported by the expanded array of complementary products and services that we have put into place over the past two years to better meet our customers' evolving needs. Per will discuss our Q1 performance and guidance in more detail later in the call, while first I will provide a brief overview of how we have repositioned our business to meet our customer demands. As you may know building on our proven expertise in design and implementation of large national LED lighting retrofit projects, we expanded into lighting and electrical maintenance services and then last year, we entered the market for electrical vehicle charging solutions. Importantly, both of these initiatives were in response to customer inquiries regarding our ability to service needs in these areas. Orion Maintenance Services was launched in fiscal 2021 to support our largest client with reactive maintenance services for their lighting and light electrical needs. Given the scale and geographic scope of our clients' requirements, we quickly recognized the need to expand our service footprint and capabilities and we proceeded to acquire Stay-Lite Lighting in Q1 of fiscal 2023. Last week we announced the signing of a three-year agreement with our largest customer to provide preventative lighting maintenance to approximately 2,000 stores nationwide. This program started in February and has scaled over the last several months. Given the increasing complexity of lighting systems and controls, Internet of Things solutions, and other electrical systems, we view maintenance as a growth opportunity in an ideal way to expand the value we can provide to our customers over the long term. We continue to build out the scope of this business to ensure we have the resources, talent and appropriate systems in place to deliver reliable high-quality and timely service to national customers', customers who may have hundreds or even thousands of locations across the country. Our maintenance solutions business also provides other benefits to Orion, which include a growing base of recurring revenue as well as a regular ongoing presence in customer locations. This positions us well to both understand and deliver products and services to meet ever-evolving needs. In October of '22, we also entered the rapidly growing market for commercial and industrial EV charging solutions with the acquisition of Voltrek. As I mentioned, a growing number of customers had asked about our capabilities in this area. After researching the market, we quickly realized that our best path to enter the space was by partnering or acquiring a company with capabilities, experience and customer service commitment essential for success. We were fortunate to find Voltrek, a pioneer in commercial EV charging solutions with deep expertise, strong industry relationships and an excellent track record. Most importantly, Voltrek had a business model and philosophy that was very similar to our turnkey LED retrofit solutions business. In our Lighting business, turnkey solutions involve initial site surveys and custom product designs, engineered for the customers' unique needs. From there, we progressed through the on-site installation and system commissioning, all with one central point of contact and accountability that provides the customers with a very streamlined and easy project solution. Our EV charging solution business model is very similar to this, as it requires upfront site visits, followed by custom design and planning to meet each customer’s needs. In both cases, Orion is positioned to provide ongoing maintenance and support. Historically, Voltrek business was focused in the Northeast nearest headquarters in Massachusetts. We are investing in a variety of initiatives to support Voltrek ability to scale its business for national reach. We are investing in personnel infrastructure and other resources to enable them to source and execute projects across the country and to more closely integrate their offerings and financial reporting within Orion. While the process of building Voltrek team and infrastructure has imposed short-term constraints on their activities during the first quarter, we are very excited by the progress they are making in building out their team and capabilities. EV charging revenue dipped sequentially in quarter 1 '24 as the unit managed through the integration and personnel recruiting processes. Segment contributed $1.2 million of revenue in Q1 '24 versus no revenue for Orion in Q1 of '23 and 3.4% in Q4 of '23. One note that in Q4 of '23, there was a large school bus project which we've previously mentioned that significantly improved this quarter's results. We anticipate substantial growth at Voltrek in coming quarters and years, as the business builds upon its expanded base of customers and projects across the US. Driving demand for EV charging infrastructure, our forecasted EVs will represent roughly half of the new vehicle fleet by 2030, the current administration also recently announced new mileage standards that are likely to drive continued growth in EV adoption. Importantly, we believe these new business areas are well aligned with our core mission of helping customers achieve their financial and sustainability goals. At Orion, we leverage the benefit of cutting edge technologies and custom design, engineering, implementation and high-quality service to develop and manage long-term customer relationships. But basically we help customers and partners navigate, implement and maintain increasingly complex and interconnected electrical systems. Additionally outside of components we manufacture most of our products in the US at our Manitowoc, Wisconsin facility. Our manufacturing capabilities provide flexibility, customization and industry-leading delivery time frames with Made in America Solutions. In our maintenance services business, revenue declined slightly to $3.8 million in Q1 of 2024 from 4.1% in Q1 of 2023 due to decreased activity with a larger customer including some special projects. The business also saw a profit decrease in the period, reflecting a combination of legacy pricing embedded in the Stay-Lite organizational contracts, as well as higher subcontractor costs. We are now rolling out updated pricing for both new and existing customers to better reflect our cost -- our current cost structure. In the case of some legacy arrangements, we have secured significant price increases to position the business for appropriate profitability. While essential, we recognize that this effort will likely result in some loss of business that could provide a modest headwind for the segment. There are plenty of growth opportunities in maintenance and we're investing to ensure we can deliver and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. After many months of work, we recently finalized a three-year preventative maintenance agreement with our largest customer, a well-regarded national retailer. This agreement formalizes and builds upon services we initiated in February and scaled through July. Under this agreement, Orion will provide LED lighting and light electrical preventive maintenance services to approximately 2,000 retail stores on a nationwide basis in addition to the existing reactive maintenance business in place. Lighting revenues were $12.6 million in quarter one 2024 versus $13.9 million in Q1 2023, again reflecting variability and timing of larger turnkey projects. Several projects are now ramping in Q2 including installations on a $9.6 million LED retrofit project in Europe for the Department of Defense, which we expect to conclude this fiscal year. This project, which started later than we originally expected was sourced in conjunction with a large international ESCO. In addition, we have recently commenced on an outdoor lighting retrofit project for our largest customer and anticipate roughly $5 million or more in revenue expansion from an existing customer in the warehouse logistics sector through an ESCO partner. Both of these new pieces of business have potential for additional revenue beyond fiscal 2024. Besides what I've mentioned, we also anticipate a full year growth in our ESCO and electrical contractor channels where we continue to build a base of productive relationships with partners who appreciate our quality, value, reliability and high levels of customer service. Our ESCO business closed quarter one up over 30% excluding the Department of Defense project and we expect strong growth to continue throughout fiscal 2024. End customers in the ESCO channel are particularly focused on energy savings and environmental goals to help them combat higher energy prices and CO2 production. Generally speaking, LED lighting retrofits provide obvious and quantifiable environmental benefits and high returns on investment ranging from 30% to 50% ROI with two to five -year payback periods. This compares to solar panel installations that typically involve 10 to 20-year paybacks. To support growth in the ESCO and electrical contractor channels, we recently launched a new line of value-oriented high bay lighting products that we call TritonPro and an expanded line of exterior LED fixtures. These new product lines were developed in response to customer and partner requests for a broader array of more competitively priced products, so we are quite optimistic about their sales potential. Reflecting these various factors, we expect our second quarter revenue to be higher than Q1 and we anticipate the second half of fiscal 2024 to be meaningfully stronger than the first half. Finally, I want to point out that since our last call Orion published our second annual sustainability report to review our mission progress and goals. I encourage everyone to take a look at their report, which is available on the homepage of our website orionlighting.com and provide us any feedback you have. Sustainability and conservation initiatives are proving to be very important to many of our large corporate customers and we expect these initiatives to play an important role in our long-term growth. While we still have work to do to build out and integrate our new lines of business, we are very proud of the progress our teams have made to-date and excited about the expanding set of opportunities ahead. With that, I will hand the call to Per Brodin to discuss our financials and fiscal year outlook in more detail.\nPer Brodin: Thank you, Mike. Our Q1 2024 revenue was $17.6 million versus $17.9 million in Q1 2023, primarily reflecting the variability and timing of certain LED lighting projects, which was mostly offset by revenue from the addition of our EV business. Our gross margin was 18% in Q1 2024 compared to 19.8% in Q1 2023, with both periods experiencing under-absorption of fixed costs on lower revenues and the current year margin pressures experienced in the maintenance business that Mike discussed earlier. Gross margin on products increased to 26.4% in Q1 2024 from 23% in Q1 2023 due to a favorable product mix and better absorption of fixed costs in our assembly operation. However, our realized gross margin on services declined to a negative 11.2% versus a positive 10.3% in Q1 2023. The deterioration in services margin primarily relates to legacy multiyear maintenance services contracts from our acquisition of Stay-Lite Lighting combined with inflationary pressures on subcontractor costs. As Mike mentioned, we are actively addressing this situation implementing price increases on new contracts and significant existing contracts. Reflecting these steps in our maintenance business and a general expectation of growing sales volume, we expect our gross profit percentage rebound as we progressed through the year with some quarterly variation based on our business volume and revenue mix. Q1 2024 operating expenses were $9.6 million in line with Q4 2023 but up from $7.2 million in Q1 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher consolidated G&A expenses from the addition of Voltrek in Q3 2023 as well as the $1.1 million acquisition-related earn-out accrual in the period. Orion recorded a Q1 2024 net loss of $6.6 million, or $0.21 per share versus a Q1 2023 net loss of $2.8 million, or $0.09 per share primarily due to flow-through on reduced gross profit the additional Voltrek infrastructure costs $1.1 million earn-out accrual. Our cash used in operations was $7.3 million in Q1 2024 due to the operational results and timing of payments for projects that were completed in Q4 fiscal 2023. This follows strong cash flow in Q4 2023 due to collections of related receivables mainly for those same projects. We expect positive free cash flow over the balance of this fiscal year and for the full fiscal year in 2024. At June 30, we had net working capital of $20.6 million, including inventory investments of $17.7 million accounts receivable of $14.6 million and cash of $8.2 million. Total liquidity, which is cash plus borrowing availability on Orion's credit facility was $16.8 million at quarter end including cash and $8.6 million of net revolver availability. We expect our cash and liquidity position to remain healthy and improve in coming quarters. As mentioned in Q2, we've started several larger projects, and we finalized the nationwide maintenance agreement with a national retailer all of which will contribute to our full year revenue growth outlook. Reflecting these and other factors, we have reiterated our expectation for revenue growth of 30% or more for fiscal 2024, which implies total revenue of approximately $100 million generally building as the year progresses. As such, we expect Q2 revenue to be stronger than Q1 and second half revenues to be meaningfully above those in the first half of the fiscal year. With that, I'll turn the call back to Shannon for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.\nAaron Spychalla: Yes. Hi. This is Aaron Spychalla for Eric. Thanks for taking the questions, Mike and Per.\nMike Jenkins: Hey, Aaron.\nPer Brodin: Hey, good to see you, Aaraon.\nAaron Spychalla: Good morning. Maybe first on the maintenance services, congrats on the contract there. Can you just -- anything else you can share on maybe size of that and opportunity with other customers just kind of the margin profile of kind of -- what we should expect there with that type of business? And then just broadly on the services margins. I know you're talking about improvement as we progress throughout the year given some of the initiatives you've done. Can you just maybe help with a finer point on that how that progresses through the year?\nMike Jenkins: Sure. First I'll touch on the maintenance contract. So this was something that was underway as we referenced for many months actually at that part of the year. Clearly based on our level of performance with this customer, first on the reactive side of their business. We built the credibility and infrastructure to be able to take on the preventative piece of business, and we feel very fortunate to have secured that. Overall, that should be a low seven to mid-seven figures piece of business for us with very good reasonable profitability.\nPer Brodin: And I'd add Aaron on that, profitability I would -- if you think about some of our legacy overall margins we expect to perform -- is to perform above that level. So that just gives you some indication of that. And then, I think as you think about the balance of the year, we do have some projects in the pipeline that we expect to hit as we move through the year. Those -- in addition to the maintenance improvements will also help improve margin as we move forward.\nAaron Spychalla: Good. Thanks for that. And then, just maybe second on the EV charging business, you talk about the growing pipeline there. Can you maybe quantify at a high-level -- where that stands today and kind of where that's from? And then, just broadly, reception from customers as you look to expand that across the country?\nMike Jenkins: Sure. A couple of things on the EV front, the pipeline continues to grow. Our pipeline today is about double what it was when we acquired Voltrek. We have over $3 million of cross-selling in our pipeline today which was one of our key initiatives, to support that business. And we see both significant Level 2 as well as the DC fast chargers Level 3 opportunities. So we're focused both on the Level 2, to support businesses with their employees, their customers as well as moving into some of their fleet operations with the DC fast chargers solutions, so, very encouraged with the pipeline that's building on the EV front.\nAaron Spychalla: All right. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPer Brodin: Aaron, I'll just add. If you think back to the conversation we had at year-end on the EV business and Mike's comment about the bus project that somewhat skewed the results in Q4. I'd say, our confidence level in what we can achieve in the EV business for the full fiscal year still remain strong and in line with the discussion we had back in June, thinking about their $6-plus million in the second half tempered a little bit for that bus project but being able to exceed that say on a run rate basis.\nAaron Spychalla: Yeah. That's good. Thanks for the color, Per. I appreciate it all. I'll hand it over.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\nPer Brodin: Good morning Alex.\nAlex Rygiel: A couple of quick questions here, first G&A expense stepped up. Can you discuss this a little bit more? And is this the new sort of normal dollar level run rate that we should be modeling going forward?\nPer Brodin: I'd say, it's at a pretty normalized level understanding that, they're included in the amount is $1.1 million of earn-out we would expect that will continue but that's clearly unrelated to just the operations but based on the nature of the agreement it's recorded through G&A. \nAlex Rygiel: Helpful. And then, as it relates to Voltrek, can you just quantify the pipeline that they have today? And how that compares to maybe when you acquired them?\nMike Jenkins: The pipeline is as I mentioned it's over double what it was. We're looking at a pipeline that's significantly growing. It's – today, it's going to be over $30 million and growing. So we're very confident that we'll be able to drive significant growth this year.\nPer Brodin: Just to clarify that is total opportunities, that is pipeline not what we disclose as backlog.\nMike Jenkins: That's correct. Yeah.\nJohn Brodin: Those are opportunities. You'll see in the 10-Q that our pipeline sits at $19 million total company -- I'm sorry, now I'm getting a backlog at the end of Q1 is $19 million.\nAlex Rygiel: That is helpful. And then regarding the $10 million LED retrofit in Europe was the -- was there an abnormal amount of sort of front-end expenses that may be weighed on you in the fiscal first quarter that will obviously sort of be more of a tailwind moving forward?\nPer Brodin: There's some of that. I'm not sure, I'd call it significant. But if you think about the project we had prep work that we did back in fiscal 2023. And if you saw in the 10-K there was approximately 200,000 recognized for that contract in Q4 of 2023 we have no revenue associated with that contract in Q1, although we did have activity doing the final prep work and getting people in place. And then as we disclosed in the release last week the true installation activity began in July. So the rest of that revenue will get recognized here between July and March of next year. And there -- there's always some inherent -- there's just always some inherent say costs that don't line up with associated revenue such as the auditing we do and some of the design work. So it's tough to put a true number on that, Alex.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Shapiro with Lawndale Capital Management. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Shapiro: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Yeah, the link wasn't working, so I was a little late to your prepared comments. So please forgive, if my questions touched on something that was in your script. But two areas of questions, first on the maintenance and service sub-segment about what portion of this sub-segment business is with fixed pricing that carry the risk of declining and in some instances it appears negative margin?\nMike Jenkins: Well, a substantial piece of the overall maintenance business is contracted and therefore has defined rates for various types of things, whether they be preventative or reactive. We did mention in the call that, those contracted rates have been fixed in place. A lot of those with our acquisition from Staylight, and these typically are three-year incremental contracts. So some of those have been fixed for periods of three some longer, due to some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen primarily with subcontractors we have initiated price increases throughout the network to the contracts that require that to be profitable.\nAndrew Shapiro: But on legacy -- yes, go on.\nMike Jenkins : Just one clarification on that.\nAndrew Shapiro: Sure.\nMike Jenkins : Well, we are in negotiations, a midstream on amending those contracts, worst case on a couple, they expire next spring. So we're not locked in for long periods of time on the legacy Stay-Lite contracts anymore.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. And that's the longest duration of the, we'll call them embedded loss contracts?\nMike Jenkins : Yes. Yes. Yes.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. And based on their annual run rate and all that, if you're not successful in getting an improvement in rates, do you have a rough estimate of what the embedded loss might be?\nMike Jenkins : It's really hard to judge at this point, Andrew. As we said, we're currently in negotiations to update those. We've had success on some fronts of getting those updated already. So we're optimistic that we'll get that done. So it's very difficult to put a number on what that might be overall. We don't see it as a significant number in connection to the whole business. And we have -- we are looking at some other ways to mitigate what that is based on how we use subcontractors. So our objective is to keep that any loss contracts at a minimum for the remainder of the period. And we said -- yes, sorry, just to add one more point to that. We did say in our prepared remarks that we thought this would generate some slight headwinds for this segment, but basically would not jeopardize our guidance of $100 million.\nPer Brodin: Well, that's on the revenue side. But obviously, though the customers are going to do whatever maintenance they can, knowing that there's a price increase coming at the expiration if they stick with us. So I'm just trying to understand what kind of loss might eat. Just like a contract.\nMike Jenkins : Yes. We typically will not see an acceleration based on something like that because there is a very defined schedule and you don't want to disrupt those operations, so.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. And again, just flushing this out, just a little bit more. When you're getting these rates adjusted to the extent your customers are working with you to be cooperative and do that. Is it to just get it up at a breakeven level, or is it -- I know your aim is, but is your -- are your customers and your relationships with it such that they're willing to give you some modest amount of margin for the remainder of the contract?\nMike Jenkins: Yeah. Clearly, our goal across the board is to have profitability in all of our individual contracts. And so the actions that we're taking right now will drive profitability for these individual contracts.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. And on the new one, what pricing or margin provision protections are in the large multiyear maintenance contract here with the nationwide retailer that you recently announced. These are the same kind of terms, or are there some better protections for us?\nMike Jenkins: Yeah. We really don't get into the specifics of individual contracts, but we feel good about this three year contract that we will be solidly profitable during the -- for the duration.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. I have follow-up questions on Voltrek, but I'll back out into the queue because I've tapped down so many questions on the maintenance and service area here.\nMike Jenkins: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jenkins.\nMike Jenkins: Operator. Sorry. I don't think Andrew realized there was no one else in the queue. So I think he was going to jump back in if you give him a minute.\nOperator: Sure. And our follow-up question is from Andrew Shapiro with Lawndale Capital Management. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Shapiro: Yeah. Hi, guys. When you said I could do it again, that's when your conference call service has this voice that interrupts and tells me that my hands raised. So I didn't hear you, but thank you for letting me back in. On Voltrek, what do you feel remains in incremental SG&A spend and time involved in order to build out the sales and service infrastructure required to extend Voltrek reach across the US?\nMike Jenkins: Yeah. What we've said previously is we were looking to double the size of the organization, primarily in new sales roles and project management and execution capabilities. We're well on our way down that path. We're not completely there yet, but we're well on our way, I would say, probably at least halfway from where we were to where we need to be.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. And in terms of the earnout, remind us what is the duration on the rest of the earnout and it's based on revenue or EBIT or cash flow generated?\nMike Jenkins: It's a three year fiscal year earnout. So the first year was completed at the end of fiscal 2023. There's two years remaining their earn-out is based on EBITDA. And there is a -- there are discrete targets for each fiscal year with a cumulative ticker potential at the end of year three.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. And you're able to -- since its EBITDA, you're able to allocate appropriately the incremental hires in costs that you're putting in place for the build-out? Yes?\nMike Jenkins: That's correct. It's a fairly self-contained operation.\nAndrew Shapiro: Okay. Great. And last, regarding just Investor Relations calendar, what's on the slate for your upcoming non-deal road shows or investor outreach activities over the rest of the year or the upcoming quarter?\nMike Jenkins: We have a non-deal road show coming up that's virtual in about 10 days or so the 21st. And we have other conference in September and November. We can send you those details offline.\nAndrew Shapiro: Yeah. But just which are the conferences for the benefit of the transcript here for others to be able to reach? Do you have that offhand?\nMike Jenkins: One is Craig-Hallum and one is H.C. Wainwright. And I think, I won't name the non-deal road shows, since that's usually done fairly discreetly, but we can get you an invitation, if you would like to do that offline.\nAndrew Shapiro: No. The calendar works out, that would be great. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jenkins, for concluding remarks.\nMike Jenkins: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I look forward to updating investors in coming months and quarters, as we execute our growth plan in fiscal 2024. Additionally, we continue to pursue opportunities to meet with investors in person or virtually. For example, as we just discussed, we expect to attend the H.C. Wainwright Conference in New York in September. For more information on planned events, or if you would like to schedule a call with management, please contact our Investor Relations team, whose information is included on today's press release. Once again, thank you for attending.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."
