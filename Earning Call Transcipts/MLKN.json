I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Carola Mengolini.\nCarola Mengolini: Good evening, and welcome to MillerKnoll's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. I am joined by Andi Owen, Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Stutz, Chief Financial Officer. Also available during the Q&A session is John Michael, President of Americas Contract and Debbie Propst, President of Global Retail. Before I turn the call over to Andi, please remember our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking information. During the call, management may discuss information that is forward-looking and involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which may cause the actual results to be different than those expressed or implied. Please evaluate the forward-looking information in the context of these factors, which are detailed in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are as of today and we assume no obligation to update or supplement these statements. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial metrics, which are reconciled and described in our press release posted on our Investor Relations website at millerknoll.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Andi. Andi?\nAndi Owen: Thanks, Carola, Good evening everyone. While this past quarter presented its challenges, we're proud to highlight our resilience and strategic focus. Despite facing a lower volume of orders and sales, we maintained a steadfast commitment to enhancing our business operations. Our efforts yielded significant results as we successfully improved gross margins across all business segments, showcasing our ability to adapt and thrive in dynamic market conditions. MillerKnoll is an agile company. We have implemented several programs across our contract and retail business to boost demand, while also putting in place restructuring measures to better align our operating costs with the evolving economic landscape. With our MillerKnoll dealer network firmly established in the U.S., we've turned our focus now to showrooms, studios and tools that make it easier to create design solutions for customers. Our showroom strategy is anchored in having fewer and more robust MillerKnoll design centers in targeted cities around the world. We're bringing our brands together so that customers and design partners can experience the full breadth of our offering in one location. To this end, we will combine our showrooms in most markets and we will also invest more heavily in dealer showrooms and dealer programs, especially in markets without a corporate showroom presence. This work is already underway in several major U.S. markets, namely Chicago, Washington DC and the Greater Los Angeles area. This follows showroom colocation enhancements that we previously announced in New York City, Toronto and London. Simultaneously, in North America alone, more than 40 dealerâ€™s showroom refreshes are in progress with many more planned. At DWR, we recently opened a new concept studio in the San Francisco Design District. The space introduces our products in a new way, showcasing rotating galleries and interactive exhibits. We understand that enhancing our environment feels great results and we've been encouraged by the increased customer interest and foot traffic in this store. Across our retail experience, we know that most orders include a customer touch point in one of our stores. By enhancing these spaces in strategic locations, we believe it will continue to build market share, especially as macroeconomic conditions become more favorable. We are also making significant progress across our technology platform. This past January, we launched our program portal experience. These are digital hubs which serve as a singular place for clients, dealers and our architecture and design partners to access projects and product information in one place, providing a forum for collaboration and streamlined processes. Similarly, we've launched augmented reality capabilities on retail and contract websites, a supplement to our highly functional 3D configurators. We've seen that customers who use these tools have a higher conversion rate and are faster to add products to the cart. These programs reflect the confidence we have in MillerKnoll's long-term value and the opportunities ahead. However, we are re list and we understand that while encouraging, these initiatives and organizational enhancements are stepping stones to achieving our goals. Existing demand pressures including the elevated cost of capital here in North America are affecting the housing and office space market and slowing the decisions related to capital expenditures. This is taking a toll on the short-term results of our business. To match the current demand environment this quarter, we implemented targeted workforce reductions and realigned our leadership team against our different business segments and geographic areas. These moves will have a meaningful impact on our SG&A cost structure. Jeff will share more details on this later. For our Americas business, while the third quarter is usually a softer period, the step up in activity that customarily comes to the end of the quarter did not materialize as expected. Our team was fast to act however, focusing on price optimization and launching a series of initiatives to help our clients make decisions and therefore coax demand. We continue to see leading indicators trending positively. Client requests for mock ups are up over 20% year-over-year and contract activations and pricing requests are up over 30% in Q3. This quarter, we are very pleased to report growth across our international contract business as we continue to transition legacy Herman Miller dealers to full MillerKnoll dealers. The transition not only enhances the product portfolio of our existing dealerships, but also involves legacy dealers opening newly branded and furnished MillerKnoll showrooms, thereby enhancing our market presence. Furthermore, we also have aggressive plans underway to bring Knoll to new markets throughout Europe. Our network around the globe is unmatched in reach and we are in a place to deliver designs for these regions as demand starts growing. Similarly, as macroeconomic pressures ease, we anticipate a release intent of retail demand and are preparing ourselves to meet this interest. Throughout our retail organization, we maintain a strong focus on inventory management and optimizing our product assortment. We've accelerated the introduction of more than 100 new styles to designs and reach, adding HAY, Muuto and Geiger products, introducing new DWR collections and expanding the assortment from our strategic third party vendors as well as building up the Knoll offering through additional finish and materials options. Furthermore, we've expanded our design services which has resulted in an increase in the penetration of orders from design services as well as fewer returns. But right now, we are at 11-year low in the luxury housing market and our retail and specialty businesses track closely with that market. New home movers spend significantly more than the average. We'll continue to watch Fed rates as they have the potential to move in our favor this year and when they do, we are prepared to capture the wins. Over the next few months, we will have exciting and significant opportunities to connect with our key clients around the globe and share the best of our collective with our core audiences at Salone and Milan and Design Days in Chicago. These are moments for us to visually demonstrate the forward thinking, innovative spirit that will carry us to the future while establishing meaningful connections. Ahead of these events, our research and insights team is conducting seminars in over 40 cities across 3 continents, sharing actionable insights with organizations on navigating changes in the way we work and adapting your spaces to our evolving world. We're highlighting several successful project profiles in the upcoming launch of season 4 of our About Place podcast. As companies navigate change and invest in their space, they continue to turn to us as a leader for our experienced database perspective on designing for tomorrow. Our industry has a once in a lifetime opportunity to redefine how we think about spaces for decades to come. We have a chance right now to push the spaces where we live and work to better support individual wellness, productivity and a sense of belonging. And when I look across our collective, there is no team more capable of rising to this occasion. We are focused and confident in the hard work we're doing right now. As always, I thank you for your continued support in MillerKnoll, and I will pass it on to Jeff for a deeper dive into this quarter's numbers. Jeff?\nJeff Stutz : Thanks, Andi. Good evening, everyone. This afternoon we shared our third quarter results and I'm pleased to announce that we have achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 in line with our guidance despite softer than expected revenue. The robust profitability we demonstrated this quarter showcases the resilience of our gross margin profile and underscores the efforts of our teams in protecting it. We delivered consolidated gross margin of 38.6% which improved more than 450 basis points over the prior year. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in adjusted gross margin. Improved operational efficiency, moderating input and delivery costs, and incremental pricing benefits were the primary drivers all of which align with the themes we have consistently communicated as our focus over the past several quarters. Furthermore, these actions were complemented by disciplined operating expense management and the ongoing benefit of our acquisition synergy program. As Andi mentioned, we took further steps this quarter aimed at improving the efficiency of our selling, general and administrative functions. This resulted in a targeted reduction of our management workforce. Additionally, we reviewed our real estate footprint and announced showroom consolidation plans in key markets which we believe will not only reduce our ongoing cost structure, but also create a more cohesive and compelling expression of our brand collective. Once fully implemented later this spring, these actions are expected to deliver annualized cost reductions of between $14 million and $16 million. At the consolidated level, net sales in the third quarter of $872 million decreased 11.4% on a reported basis and 10.1% organically compared with the same quarter last year. New orders totaled $830 million reflecting an organic decrease 4.7% from the same quarter a year ago. While we saw declines in both the Americaâ€™s contract and retail segments, demand levels in the International and Specialty segment were more encouraging, particularly in the contract component of our business. Although consolidated order levels for the full quarter did not meet our near-term expectations, the trend improved across all segments as we move through the period. And for the month of February, our consolidated orders were up 2.8% over last year. Within the Americas contract segment, net sales for the quarter were $441 million representing an organic decrease of 9.2% from the same quarter a year ago. New orders in the period reflected a similar pattern coming in 9.4% lower than last year on an organic basis. Here again demand trends improved as we move through the period and into the early part of Q4. In fact over the last 2 weeks orders have trended up over 5% to last year. Despite lower sales versus last year, we again delivered much improved gross margins in the Americas segment this quarter. Net pricing benefit, moderating input costs, the realization of synergy benefits and tightly managed operating expenses contributed to achieving a gross margin of 33.1% and adjusted operating margin of 8.1%. Although, we're not yet seeing their consistent impact on order rates, we remain highly optimistic that improvement is on the horizon given a range of forward-looking data points. Indicators such as customer inquiries, project mock up requests and contract activations continue to grow year-over-year and the overall funnel of project opportunities remains encouraging. Within the funnel of projects, we are tracking the value of opportunities that we have won, but for which the actual order has not yet been received. We're encouraged to share that this number is double the value it was this time last year. All of this adds to our confidence that we are at or near a demand inflection point in the business. The question remains however one of timing. By historical comparison, we continue to experience delays in the time it takes customers to make final order decisions and this has added to the complexity and challenge of forecasting the business. Considering the current macroeconomic climate with elevated interest rates, lagging ABI readings and sentiment measures edging higher but still below pre-pandemic levels, none of this is surprising to us. Still the data we are tracking inside our business and what we hear from customers and our dealers gives us confidence that there is pent up demand awaiting further improvements in the macro backdrop. Turning to our International Contract and Specialty segment, net sales for the quarter totaled $217 million, which is down 10.6% organically year-over-year, while new orders came to $228 million reflecting a year-over-year organic increase of 7.9%. Demand patterns month-to-month continue to be inconsistent. However, orders grew in both December and February primarily driven by Mainland Europe, South Korea, India, China, Australia and in the Middle East. One of our key strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the scope and reach of our international network is completing the transition from Herman Miller to full line MillerKnoll dealers. This effort is steadily gaining momentum with currently over 40% of this network offering the MillerKnoll product portfolio. We have a consistent schedule of additional transitions planned in the upcoming quarter. We were also pleased with the margin profile of this segment. The adjusted operating margin was 10.4% in the third quarter, albeit down 110 basis points year-over-year due to lower sales volume. Despite this, we continue to expand gross margins. In this past quarter, we achieved a record level of 44.5% favorable product mix, improved freight and distribution management and proactive restructuring initiatives taken earlier in the year all contribute to this improved profit picture. As it relates to our Global Retail segment, in the third quarter net sales totaled $214 million reflecting an organic decrease of 11.3%, while new orders totaled $183 million marking a 7.1% organic decline primarily due to subdued housing related demand. Regarding adjusted operating margin for the retail segment this quarter, we achieved 5.6%, 10 basis points higher than last year despite the decrease in net sales. The main drivers of the margin expansion were improved operational and delivery efficiency and favorable product mix. Despite the challenging retail environment, our retail team remains dedicated to improving in-store experiences, broadening our product offer, enhancing digital capabilities and elevating brand awareness. And we're confident that this strategic approach will nurture brand loyalty, promote deeper engagement and position our business to take advantage of pent up demand as market conditions improve. And we're beginning to see signs of improvement in the economic data. As Andi mentioned, home sales in the U.S. are at 11-year lows demographic trends point to robust future construction growth. This is evidenced by last month's homebuilderâ€™s sentiment readings which posted its third consecutive monthly gain in February reaching its highest level since August of 2023. Moreover, renovation activity should also benefit from an aging housing stock and eventual turnover. As we mentioned to you last quarter, we believe that the demand fundamentals for this segment are pointing stronger and expect the retail segment to be a major contributor to both top and bottom line growth in our business for years to come. Regarding cash flow in the balance sheet this quarter, we saw cash generation of $61 million in cash from operations. This enabled us to repurchase approximately 1.5 million shares for a total cash outlay of approximately $40 million. At quarter end, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.65x. Now let's turn our near-term view to guidance and outlook. Given the macroeconomic conditions currently impacting our demand picture, we expect net sales the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 to range between $880 million and $920 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the period are expected to be $0.49 and $0.57. The midpoint of this earnings range implies year-over-year growth of approximately 29%, which is notable given the decline in year-over-year revenue. And based on this forecast, we expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $1.90 and $1.98. While economic uncertainty certainly persists in parts of our business, we're growing in our confidence that a favorable shift in demand patterns is on the horizon. And we believe this will translate into broad based sales and earnings growth as we move through the upcoming fiscal year. So, with that overview of the numbers, I'll now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti.\nGreg Burns: Could you just talk about your win rates in the Americas and maybe why you think maybe it's taking longer for some of this to move through your funnel? And do you feel like there's been any changes in share in the market? And do you feel like you maybe need to get more aggressive with maybe some of your incentives to start converting maybe some of what you're seeing in your pipeline? Thank you.\nAndi Owen: Hey, Greg, it's Andi. That's a lot of questions, so I'll start with a couple of points. First off, I think demand patterns in the early part of your recovery are always choppy, and they often really vary significantly based on customer size and industry sector. So I think that's really kind of where we find ourselves currently, and I don't think we're either surprised or disheartened to see some relative differences across the competitive landscape and I think in fact every cycle in the last 25 years has played out this way. I think from a quarter-to-quarter fluctuation demand over the long term, we believe in the right position to protect our market share. From a timing perspective, I think it is still taking customers longer to make decisions on what's in the funnel and what's been won. I think our win rate is actually 3% higher than last year, which is really encouraging. We are not seeing pricing activity that is frightening to us or it feels like we need to discount more. It feels very stable out there. We're addressing pricing on a job by job basis, but we're not feeling like it is incredibly competitive. John, I'd let you add a little bit more to that if you want.\nJohn Michael: Yes, I would add Andi, if we look at what's in the funnel in addition to significant increase in new opportunities added to the funnel, as you mentioned the win rate is up slightly and Jeff mentioned in his opening comments that as we track an opportunity through the sales process, the second to last step is it's either marked closed or won and then the final step is it's booked. And the amount of projects and opportunities in that final step closed won for us has increased significantly versus prior year. So it is really just a matter of timing in terms of that converting into an order. We're still seeing construction delays and supply chain things in other industries that are impacting project timing. But again looking at all the leading indicators, they are all pointing in the right direction right now.\nGreg Burns: And then, when you look at the balance sheet, obviously generating cash looks like you bought back some stock this quarter. Are you comfortable with the leverage here? Like why not, what's your decision factor between buying back shares versus maybe paying down the debt?\nJeff Stutz: We have, this is, we've been buying some shares all fiscal year at different levels and we've just been opportunistic. We think the shares are undervalued. We think it's good deal and a good investment. Now having said that we have been balanced. If you look at the course of the 1st 9 months of the fiscal year, we've taken a balanced approach in both bought shares and paid down some debt. This quarter just due to some timing of accessing some of our international cash, we did see our debt level tick up a little bit at the end of the quarter. But the intent has been in our plan going forward will continue be balanced on that front. No, we're not concerned with the leverage ratio. Again, as we look ahead and we look at the internal measures that we've noted on the call, what we see our clouds clearing from a macroeconomic perspective and the trends we've even seen within each of the 3 business segments from an order entry standpoint, we're confident we're going to see demand improvements on the horizon. Our margins are strong well above last year's levels and so we're quite comfortable with the level that we're at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Water Tower Research.\nBudd Bugatch: Congratulations on the profitability in the quarter. I know that's a difficult thing and you're managing that well. But I am concerned about what I see in the implied backlogs, particularly in the Americas contract, which looks to me to be somewhere, I think, probably in the $355 million to $360 million range, Jeff, if I did the math right?\nJeff Stutz: That's right, Budd.\nBudd Bugatch: And that's the lowest backlog in Americaâ€™s contract since before the acquisition, since the acquisition, time of the acquisition. And it makes it I think you told me it makes it very difficult to leverage your manufacturing at that same time, so irrespective of the pricing. What's going on there? When will we see that backlog start to rise?\nJeff Stutz: Well, Budd, I won't disagree with you that we everyone in this room is nodding. We have every interest to see order rates pick up and we're spending our full efforts as an organization to support the sales organization to support the operations organization to drive order growth. And that's what it's going to take and I think we are as we said in the prepared comments we're on the cusp of seeing order demand pick up. We saw some positive trends as we move through the quarter. I made the comment that Americas orders in the last couple of weeks have increased over last year same weeks prior year. So the trends are pointing in the right direction. I think the macro indicators as we've covered are pointing in the right direction. We fully expect to see that backlog begin to grow, but you know we have been through 18 months or so of what I would call a contract economic recession and we're finding our way to the bottom of it and we will find our way through the other side of it.\nBudd Bugatch : I have more on that, but I know I've got one more follow-up. And let me just go to the global retail because again that looks like that's a significant drawdown in backlog, not quite as severe as AC. But what, can you talk a little bit Andi on the global retail, what you're seeing in terms of e-commerce versus in-store? How do we look on same-store, same location or same brand kind of basis, however you wanted to give us a flavor on that and the future of that particular segment as well?\nAndi Owen: Yes, Budd it's a great question and Debbie's here, so I'm going to let her answer the specifics. But I think it's very promising and some of the backlog that you're referring to from last year reflected some of the supply chain issues that we were having along with many other retailers as we work through that. I think the reduction in backlog is actually a really good thing and a point to how we're managing our inventory much more efficiently. And the cycle time from when you were ordering furniture for us now to when it's showing up in your home is much shorter. So that processing is actually really beneficial because it drives more conversion. And I would say that business is really healthy, outperforming competition. So Debbie, do you want to answer some of the specifics?\nDebbie Propst: Hi, there. As it pertains to some of the channel questions you had, we're seeing fairly consistent patterns across our three channels, stores, web and wholesale, with one exception that given the design service implementation that we've been doing in our stores, we're really seeing an acceleration of average order value in that channel as the contribution of design service sales picks up. Those orders are about over 2x the size in dollar volume of our non-design service sales. So we're very focused on optimizing the store traffic and the activity around design services. We're in the process of densifying our store floor sets to showcase more of the expanded offering in stores, as well as making sure that we're being much louder and more aggressive about driving traffic towards these design services now that our sales force is fully trained in that capability.\nBudd Bugatch: So the average ticket in retail are you in the $2,000 to $3,000 range?\nDebbie Propst: Yes, that's correct.\nBudd Bugatch : All right. Thank you. Good luck on the next quarters and the balance of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital.\nAlex Fuhrman: Andi, could you talked a little bit about consolidating some showrooms in an effort to align the cost structure. What about on the global retail side of the business? Do you think there are opportunities there to maybe consolidate some of your retail stores? Or are there still opportunities to continue to open more stores there?\nAndi Owen: It's a great question, Alex. And just to touch on the showroom consolidation, I think the major driver behind why we've decided to do this is really driven from our customers in the AD community and making sure that we have everything in an easy and convenient place for them to actually see all of our brands. So we're very excited about that. It's not really driven by cost. Cost is a great side benefit, but really driven by the customer and what they're telling us. From a retail store standpoint, we are very under stored compared to our competition. And I would say we have opportunity to increase our store footprint. We find that our customer that shops online as well as in bricks and mortar is increasingly a better customer. So we think we have a huge opportunity in the next 2 to 3 years to increase that footprint. We're also seeing really, really successful trends in our stores. Debbie mentioned design services, the work that our AEs are doing to personalize and really move the sale forward is very helpful. So, we're very bullish on store growth.\nAlex Fuhrman: And Andi, are there any brands in particular you think are under stored or perhaps opportunities for multi branded stores?\nAndi Owen: I think primarily our initial growth will be around the DWR brand and Herman Miller. We definitely think there's possibility for Knoll as well, but we carry Knoll within design within reach as well. So, all of our brands have potential, but those 3 other ones we'll focus on first.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Just wanted to kind of clarify plus square something up, Jeff. You talked about kind of maybe nearing or being at an inflection point. I don't know if that was in Americas specific comment or just kind of in general, but you're also announcing a restructuring, implementing cost savings, I would guess, because you've had kind of consistent order pressure over the last year or 18 months as you put it. Can you kind of walk us through the decision or the thought process there, why restructuring now if we're going to start coming out of this? And then I got a follow-up.\nAndi Owen: Let me start with that one, Reuben, and then I'll pass it on to Jeff. Listen, we're always looking at our structure and how efficient we're being. And remember, we're still finishing up integration between these two companies. And as we finish some of our synergy work, as we move toward into the future, we're becoming more and more efficient in certain functions. So as we've done that, we've taken the opportunity to sort of close the circle on many of the integration activities. We think we're mostly at the end, but this is really kind of the final part of that. Jeff, what would you add?\nJeff Stutz: No, Andi, I think that's right. Reuben to your question, I would caution you to read really anything into that. I mean, one of the things we have always prided ourselves on it at MillerKnoll is trying to be on our front foot and making sure that we are responding to the current market conditions that we see but also protecting the strategic investment parts of the business that we are confident are going to help grow the business top-line and profitability going forward. And this is I think you can look at this as an ongoing practice of that kind of housekeeping. I mean this was not a this was targeted as I mentioned in my prepared comments around the management ranks and it was not just a cost take out but it was also a simplification set of decisions. I mean that Andi said it in her prepared comments, but I'll just emphasize that the decisions around real estate, it would be wrong to think of that as purely focused on cost take out. This is about creating a much more compelling expression of the combined millennial brands in these major markets that we serve. So, it certainly is not all about cost and I mean, I guess, I'd leave it at that.\nReuben Garner: Sorry, I was on mute. Yes, that's helpful. And then I guess this pricing sounds like it's stable. Can you just talk about I know you're coming into the end of your fiscal year, but maybe talk about it on a go forward basis the next kind of year? What's left in the pricing actions that you've already announced? When was the last pricing action you announced? Do you need another one this year to keep up with inflation? Are you seeing your competitors announce them? I guess just kind of an update on price cost in this environment?\nJeff Stutz: Yes, Reuben, this is Jeff, and John please jump in. I would characterize where we feel we are as an organization is we're kind of back to what I would say are more traditional, more ongoing annual price increases as a cadence. There are still inflationary pressures there nowhere near the level that we were seeing when we were having to do multiple price increases per year. Our last increase was last June. It will probably on that say roughly that same type of calendar schedule as we move forward and much more in line with kind of pre-COVID annualized price increase percentages.\nReuben Garner: And then, I guess last question, you kind of answered the share question. I think that was directed at the Americas side. My question is actually internationally the business seems to be holding up a little better. And in fact, it looks like the last quarter showing growth again. How much of that would you attribute to kind of maybe the benefits that there were between Knoll and Miller versus have you seen a stabilization in macro over there kind of quicker? I know it's been a volatile situation, but just kind of thoughts on how things have transpired over the last 6 that I know?\nAndi Owen: I'm getting the combination of all other things, really I think the great news about our international business is that it is very diverse. So if you still struggle in Europe, then you have China that's beginning to wake up to offset that. So I think we have markets, as we mentioned over the last several calls, the Middle East, India, Asia and China starting to wake up that are really kicking in. And that stability has driven the business forward. And the one thing to remember too, Reuben, with the differences in our business in international and the Americas is that international is much more nascent and we are much more lightly penetrated. So, we have a lot of opportunity to grow market share and to expand markets to grow dealers. And also Knoll is supplementing part of our product offer that we never had in Europe before. So, as we continue to transition Herman Miller dealers to MillerKnoll dealers, there's momentum behind that. And as dealers begin to learn the products, there's momentum behind that. So I would just say it's really just a difference in the maturity of the markets and how we penetrate in the markets. And Jeff, what would you add to that?\nJeff Stutz: No, I think that covers it. I think it's spot on.\nReuben Garner: And guys, I said I think I said last one, but I'm going to sneak one more in if that's all right. Jeff, can you just maybe you said this, but just to restate it if you could. The order patterns that you saw throughout the quarter, can you walk through those, again? What kind of December, January, February look like? And then were those specific to, were those consolidated or did you break out Americas? And if you didn't, could you talk about what you're seeing in Americas on a month by month basis?\nJeff Stutz: Yes, let me start Reuben with just kind of the consolidated picture. We were down from an organic order perspective down to 4.7% on the full quarter Q3, but we came into the quarter down closer to 10%, 11% and we exited at a consolidated level in February up almost 3%. So we saw a fairly steady improvement in the year-over-year organic order calcs as we move through that was consolidated. The Americas not a wildly different story there. I mean, we came into the quarter in December with larger year-on-year declines. That we saw improvement as we moved into January we were kind of mid-single-digit declines February on around that same level, so we ended the full quarter down 9.4%. So we saw that improvement as we move through February and then what's been most encouraging is quarter to date through the kind of the latest data, the Americas segment is down, that it certainly has improved down 3% and the last couple of weeks up 5%. So, it's been a fairly consistent walk toward an improving trend line.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'll now turn the floor back to President and CEO, Andi Owen, for closing remarks.\nAndi Owen: Thank you so much. I want to thank everyone again for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to connecting with you all again soon. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."

With that, I will turn the call over to Andi. Andi?\nAndi Owen: Thanks, Carola, Good evening everyone and thank you for joining our call. MillerKnoll has delivered another quarter of strong financial performance marked by a 28.3% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share. Our second quarter results speak to the benefits of strategic emphasis we have placed on diversifying our business model. The benefits of our synergy capture and the resilience of our company as we continue to navigate various global challenges. By leveraging the synergies across our collective, and focusing on what is within our control, the team drove year-over-year margin improvement in all three areas of our business again. And while we faced relative high interest rates and geopolitical concerns, positive signs are emerging throughout our industry, metrics such as project funnel activity, order intake, and recent measures of dealer optimism reflect that CEO confidence is improving. As it pertains to each of our segments, revenues for Americas Contract declined quarter-over-quarter, but we delivered another quarter of margin expansion, mainly due to positive price dynamics and synergy capture. Since our integration with MillerKnoll, we have invested resources into our dealer network, and we continue to see the fruits of this labor. Our immersive dealer training session this fall was one of our best-attended sessions to date. Cross-selling is up from the same period last year, along with digital tool adoption. The faster and easier we can make our processes, the more we see a direct correlation to a larger share of the wallet and higher sales. We're also delighted to see how our dealers are investing in their showrooms, to tell the story of all our brands and products. Similarly, we opened our first MillerKnoll Showroom this past quarter in Dallas. The first of its kind, this showroom showcases Herman Miller and Knoll, as well as an immersive MillerKnoll area, designed with settings from a variety of our collective brands. Places like this, which integrate our wide portfolio of solutions under one roof will continue to enhance our leading position within the contract furniture industry. Consistently our corporate customers express their desire to discover innovative ways to foster team connections and enhance the overall quality of the work experience. This includes the creation of more purposeful, inclusive spaces, even in situations where downsizing may be a factor. Corporate leaders seek guidance and information about available options and our team is actively responding to these requests by offering carefully curated and thoroughly researched solutions. As an observation, we perceive a stabilization and return to office trends. In the fall, we conducted a survey involving 5,000 people across nine countries relevant to our business. The results indicated that 49% are employed by organizations with full in-office policies, while 37% work for organizations with hybrid policies. Notably, only about 13.6% of organizations have adopted a remote-first approach. Shifting our attention to the International Contract and Specialty segment. We continue to see strength in healthcare, tech, and the financial services verticals. We continue to focus on these market-resilient sectors, where our products compete strongly due to our scale, agile manufacturing capabilities, and distribution network. We are continuing to help our existing dealers transition to selling our full MillerKnoll portfolio, while also attracting strong new dealers to our international network. This quarter, we also saw demand increase in our specialty businesses, including a double-digit increase within our luxury trade-focused business, Holly Hunt. Turning to Global Retail, the team delivered its strongest day in the company's history, with a record-breaking number of orders, followed by a record number of shipments in a single day. We were thrilled to see customers turn to us as a destination for key furniture pieces, with November being the largest sales month ever for our Retail business. Investments in our digital capabilities, excellence in customer service, and enhanced marketing capabilities, along with a focus of driving traffic to our largest banners and improved reliability, all played crucial roles in bolstering sales this period. Our team also adopted an agile strategic approach to this critical period that resonated with our customers in this highly promotional environment and significantly contributed to driving demand toward our highest margin brands and collections. Design Within Reach remains a key avenue for reaching retail customers. In 2024, we have plans to enhance our DWR spaces through incremental assortment display and enhanced store design services. We will leverage revenue opportunities and also increase our brand awareness, enabling new customers to sit in their very first Eames Lounge Chair and personally experienced some of our most iconic designs, while also getting to know newer designers and third-party brands. Furthermore, as we continue to expand our e-commerce business and enhanced AI and visualization tools, in order to enhance conversion. Throughout this quarter, we continue to innovate and reimagine our product portfolio. We reintroduced Knoll's classic Model 31 and 33 designs for purchase. Launched a high-profile limited addition Gaming Chair with G2 Esports and at Herman Miller we debuted a new nesting chair and further expanded our essential OE1 Workspace Collection for contract clients. NaughtOne introduced a playful new lounge chair, which received many notable accolades and Maharam celebrated 20 years, have continued collaboration with iconic British designer Paul Smith. Shifting gears, this past quarter we issued our first Better World Report of MillerKnoll. This report is a broad view of our efforts across the environmental, social, and governance areas. Also during this quarter and for the 15th consecutive year, we received a top score from the human rights campaigns Corporate Equality Index. Inclusion and a sense of belonging are integral elements within our organizational culture and have the experiences we design and it's an honor to have our commitment to a quality recognized in this way. In November, we organized our annual company-wide Day of Purpose, providing our employees across the globe a day of leave from the office to contribute to their communities, and ensuring our US team members are able to participate in regional elections. Our associates organized over 150 Day of Purpose events around the world. This initiative brought greater support to our commitment to improve our local communities and our planet. We reaffirmed once more that when we come together as one MillerKnoll family, we can achieve more. In summary, while remaining agile and nimble in this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs, increasing our employee engagement, and adding value to our shareholders. This is an exciting time for us, strengthening our business and accelerating as the market rebounds. As always, we appreciate your support. Now, I'll ask Jeff to walk us through the financials. Jeff?\nJeff Stutz: Thank you, Andi. Good evening, everyone. As Andi just said, we're happy to deliver another quarter of strong earnings and a further increase to our full-year EPS guidance to a midpoint of $2.08, despite what remains a rather challenging macroeconomic backdrop for our industry. Our consolidated adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 7.9%, an all-time high since we became MillerKnoll and our adjusted EPS was $0.59, up 28.3% year-over-year. Moreover, we continue to improve our gross margins. This quarter we delivered a consolidated gross margin of 39.2% up year-over-year in all three of our business segments. As we mentioned in the press release, this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of consolidated year-over-year adjusted gross margin expansion. Notably, these results were achieved in an environment largely affected by high interest rates and geopolitical concerns, both of which includes the housing market as well as sentiment measures. Our second quarter results reinforced themes that we've communicated over the past several quarters, namely the impact of strategic pricing initiatives, ongoing benefits of acquisition-related synergies, our focus on improved working capital management, and product and regional mix optimization. Our strong profitability in the quarter despite softness on the topline demonstrates the resilience that we are building around our operating margin. With respect to cash flows and the balance sheet, we generated $82.4 million of cash flow from operations this quarter. This enabled us to pay down $19 million of outstanding debt and provided an opportunity to repurchase approximately 1.4 million shares, amounting to a total cash expenditure of $28 million. As the quarter concluded, our net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at just under 2.5 turns. New orders at the consolidated level totaled $944 million in the second quarter, reflecting an organic decrease of 6% from the same quarter last year. While new orders in total were lower than last year's level, we were heartened to see the sequential trend improve steadily as we progressed through the quarter. Within our Americas Contract segment, net sales for the quarter were $476 million, representing an organic decrease of 10.3% from the same quarter a year ago. New orders in the period totaled $437 million, down 8.1% from last year on an organic basis. Within the quarter, order comparisons to last year were somewhat volatile between September and October. This is largely due to the timing of a price increase that became effective in October of last year. Setting this aside, order growth in the month of November stabilized, with segment orders coming in 8% higher than last year. Additionally, for this segment, orders in the first two weeks of Q3 were up 15% year-over-year. Our confidence is further bolstered by other forward-looking demand indicators, including project funnel activity and a notable increase in requests for project pricing and mock-up builds. Customer showroom visits were also higher this quarter, with West Michigan visits up 28% year-over-year. We remain committed to providing our dealers with compelling content and dynamic tools to aid them in their projects, and our investment in technology is playing a key role in accelerating these efforts. In November, we launched a significant upgrade to our proprietary B2B e-commerce platform. This platform will substantially improve our ability to on-board new clients at a much faster pace. The on-boarding process is already underway and the backlog of new opportunities is growing. I'd also like to highlight the fact that our Americas Contract team delivered another strong quarter of earnings with its adjusted operating margin totaling 9.4%. This was the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year margin improvement for this segment, despite lower revenue. This year-over-year expansion reflects the positive price cost dynamics and benefits from synergy capture, which are contributing to the overall resilience and operational success of the segment. Turning to our International Contract and Specialty segment, net sales for the quarter totaled $241.2 million, down 10.4% organically year-over-year, while new orders came to $234 million, reflecting a year-over-year organic decrease of 5%. Similar to the Americas segment, order trends improved as we moved through the quarter, and ended in positive territory for the month of November and through the first two weeks of Q3. Nonetheless, macroeconomic challenges, particularly in China and parts of Europe, have impacted the demand dynamics of this segment. In addressing these challenges and aligning with our commitment to agility and continuous improvement, we implemented targeted restructuring actions this quarter aimed at bolstering manufacturing efficiency and adjusting the operating expense run rate of the business. With all that said, our optimism for the medium to long-term growth prospect of this segment remains high, especially in markets like India, South Korea, and in the Middle East. To this end, we're continuing to focus on transitioning legacy Herman Miller dealers to full-line MillerKnoll dealers. To date, we have transitioned just over 30% of the global network and we have more planned in the second half of this fiscal year. Adjusted operating margin within this segment was 11.3% in the second quarter, down year-over-year, driven by lower sales volume. This was partially offset by improved gross margin performance, which continues to benefit from previous price increases, cost synergies, favorable regional and product mix, and the restructuring actions that I just mentioned. Moving to our Global Retail segment, net sales in the second quarter of $232 million were down 9.4% organically from the same quarter last year and new orders for this segment of $273 million were 3% lower from a year ago on an organic basis. This relative decline in organic orders is, however, an improvement compared to the 6.4% decrease posted in the previous quarter. The retail team's agile and strategic approach to promotions enabled us to drive year-over-year organic demand growth in November and as Andi highlighted, demand in this critical month of the retail calendar reached an all-time record level for the segment. Despite the challenges posed by the slowdown in the housing market and elevated interest rates, we remain optimistic about the retail team's efforts to gain market share through direct-to-consumer channels. We believe the longer-term demand fundamentals for this business are robust, with the US housing market facing undersupply and demographic trends pointing towards substantial future construction growth. Accordingly, our retail team remains focused on investments and initiatives geared toward market expansion, including assortment expansion and innovation, and enhanced digital capabilities. Adjusted operating margin in the retail segment was 7.1%. This is 570 basis points higher than Q2 of last year due to a host of operational improvements including inventory management and enhanced shipping revenues. Now I'm going to turn my attention to our near-term guidance and outlook. Given the improvements we are seeing in gross margins across each of our business segments and continued signs of demand stabilization in the business, we're increasing our adjusted earnings guidance for the full fiscal year, which we now expect to range between $2 and $2.16 per share. As it relates to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect net sales to range between $890 million and $930 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.40 and $0.48 per share. Consolidated orders through the first two weeks of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 grew 4% organically compared to last year. Our revenue guidance considers this, as well as the size and scheduling of the beginning backlog, and it also considers the relative seasonal decrease that we normally experience from the second to the third quarter, which is characterized by lower demand and shipping activity in the contract segments driven by the holiday season. So with those overview comments, and I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Burns of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nJeff Stutz: Greg, are you there? He may be on mute.\nOperator: We'll get back to him at a later time. Check again. Your next question then comes from the line of Reuben Garner of The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nReuben Garner: Thank you. Good evening, everybody.\nJeff Stutz: Hey Reuben.\nAndi Owen: Hey Reuben.\nReuben Garner: Maybe we could start big picture in the Americas. Last couple of quarters, you've talked a lot about seeing kind of signs of a turning point and discussed an increased project funnel in order intake and visits to the showrooms and that sort of thing. Orders still seem a little bit choppy, I think, is that fair to say or what do you think it's going to take for kind of the order level to turn the quarter and maybe return to growth on a consistent basis?\nAndi Owen: It's a great question, Ruben. Actually, we're pretty optimistic about order growth in the Americas. As Jeff mentioned in his opening comments, our comparisons to last year in September and October were pretty volatile and probably out of sync based on a price increase that we did last year. So if you normalize for that and you look at our trend coming out of October when we took the price increase last year, we're confident in the increases that we've seen from that point on. Jeff or John, what would you add to that?\nJohn Michael: I would just add, I think the work patterns that have really been sort of bouncing around sort of post-COVID have really begun to stabilize. And I think clients are now more in a position to take action than they have been previously. And I think the reference to funnel activity and showroom visits and those types of leading indicators really demonstrates that fact that they're getting closer to pulling the trigger on a lot of these projects and there's a fair amount of them in the funnel.\nJeff Stutz: Yeah, Reuben, this is Jeff. I agree with all of that. The only other color I would add and I think you know this, but I think it warrants saying out loud. You know, that in moments of -- kind of the beginning of a recovery in this business, I think your word was right. Choppy demand patterns are very typical. And so, as Andi said, we had a fairly volatile start to the quarter, I think in large part due to that timing of the price increase, but really feels like things began to stabilize in November. And as I said in the opening remarks, up 8% in November, up 15% in the first two weeks of the new quarter. And a reminder, last quarter we were up 2% for the segment in total for the full quarter.\nReuben Garner: Got it. And any areas of particular strength or weakness within your contract business that you would call out or are you starting to see some of the bigger cities, bigger customers return in a bigger way? Is that what's driving kind of the recent stabilization?\nJohn Michael: Definitely seeing some of that. I think if you looked at the sectors, energy, public sector, pharma, healthcare are all pretty vibrant now, sort of across the board. I think there are still some geographic soft spots. Certain large cities that were maybe tech heavier than others are still a little bit slower to recover. But in general, they're all -- they all seem to be coming back. And then, of course, there are those that have been pretty robust throughout all of this, be that areas like Texas, Midwest, et cetera, that have been relatively stable.\nAndi Owen: And Reuben, I would say globally, we continue to see strength in the Middle East. We continue to see strength in India. We're seeing China sort of slowly come back, which is encouraging. And then I think Europe is starting to feel a little bit better than it had usually. So internationally, we have markets that are definitely seeing strength.\nReuben Garner: And you made reference to, I think, in the same vein as synergies and cross-selling and some other initiatives you have ongoing product and regional mix optimization. Can you refresh me on what you've got going on there and what kind of benefits you're seeing?\nJeff Stutz: Reuben this is Jeff, I'll start and Deb, you might want to jump in because I think some of this certainly relates to you. So part of the mix that I'm referring to, it becomes segment and channel mix, Reuben. And when we index into retail, we get the benefit of the retail margin profile at the gross margin level. And of course, November, as we highlighted in the opening remarks, kind of the critical month of the year for that. Within the international business in particular, there are certain regions of the world where we tend to index a little higher into seating for example, and we've had some strength in those parts of the world in particular. So that's kind of the regional mix comment. Debbie, I don't know if you want to add any comment on the retail side.\nAndi Owen: Before we get to retail too, Reuben, as you've heard us talk about in the past, as we see our contract customers wanting to look more at ancillary options, those are obviously a little bit better margin for us than kind of workstations. So that's another piece in the contract business from a product mix standpoint. And then retail, Debbie?\nDebbie Propst: And from a retail perspective, with a promotional posture we took this holiday season, we really focused on driving demand through owned brands, specifically the Herman Miller brand, where we saw really nice increases in performance in our gaming category and nice resilience out of our upholstery category. We were able to sell our large ticket items with rich margins and drive margin growth, both year-over-year and sequentially from Q1.\nReuben Garner: Got it. Thanks guys. That's it for me. Happy holidays and Happy New Year.\nJeff Stutz: Thank you, Reuben.\nAndi Owen: You too.\nJohn Michael: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.\nAlex Fuhrman: Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking my question. Andi, it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about your customers return to the office plans. There continue to be a lot of really negative headlines out there about office occupancy in North America and expectations for next year. Can you help us bridge that gap a little bit? You're obviously on the front lines here of the return to the office. Do you think some of the headlines out there are maybe getting it wrong or are too pessimistic for next year? Or is it possible that maybe your large multinational customers are returning to the office perhaps faster than small and medium-sized businesses? Just trying to better understand what you're seeing and how that squares with some of the headlines that are out there?\nAndi Owen: Yeah, funny. Alex, actually I think there's a little bit less headlines than there were about six or eight months ago, but I think every market is a little bit different. But what we're hearing and seeing as we sit and speak with our customers in the contract market is that there's a lot more momentum around getting people back together, for all the reasons that you see in the press as well. So we're seeing people come to us with, instead of, hey, we're thinking about, they have ideas about what they want to do, they have plans to bring people back to the office. So I think the key here is flexibility. I think return to office is absolutely picking up. I think, as John said, there are markets where we see much more momentum than others in the US. You would agree with that, John, but certainly momentum is building. What would you add?\nJohn Michael: I would add that a lot of companies are downsizing their real estate portfolio, but going to smaller spaces really triggers project activity for us. So even though from an overall commercial real estate perspective, there's a lot of headwinds, the movement within the commercial real estate creates activity for what we do and what our dealers do. So whether that's moves, ads and changes, or new workplaces to reflect new ways of working, it creates demand. And I think our clients realize that the real estate has to work harder than ever in order to attract people back into the office to make the social connections that they can't get working remotely or hybrid. And that's really our focus, is helping them figure that out.\nAlex Fuhrman: Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks, guys. And then you guys have done a really good job of growing EBITDA so far this year -- in a year when revenue has been down pretty significantly. How should we think about kind of your margin profile heading into next year? Is it possible that you could continue to see further gross margin increases here, even if revenue remains kind of at current levels or at a certain point are you going to need revenue growth to resume in order to start getting earnings continuing to move higher?\nJeff Stutz: Yeah, this is Jeff. I think we still have a little bit of room I believe in some of the more recent pricing actions. But I think you hit on a key point and that is at some point and I don't think we're too far off from it. We do need to see some top-line growth to drive leverage in our manufacturing operations. I think that the retail team is doing a really nice job. We talked on the prepared remarks about assortment expansion and some of the newness. I think we've got some real opportunity there to drive some margin rich products into that business and growth. But within the contract business in particular, I think our margin profile is at some point going to be reliant on top-line growth for meaningful, further expansion. I mean, our teams are constantly working on VA/VE type initiatives to drive efficiencies. They're really good at it. We expect it. We plan for those every year. And so I think there's a window here where without top line growth, we still can show some improvement with that, plus some of the pricing that we still have in place. But at some point history would say you've got to have that top line moving. The good news is, as we've said, we've got growing optimism that that's coming.\nAlex Fuhrman: That's terrific. Thanks to all of you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.\nGregory Burns: Good Afternoon. Can you hear me this time?\nAndi Owen: Yeah. Hi, Greg.\nGregory Burns: Okay, great. So I just wanted to, I guess, touch on the kind of the relative strength in the retail segment or I guess the better than expected. It was definitely stronger than I was expecting, given some of the macro headwinds facing the housing market. So can you just talk about specifically what do you think you're doing right to drive market share gains there and then also on the profitability of that segment? Is that sustainable what you put up this quarter or there is some kind of one-off type of items that were driving the operating margin this quarter?\nJohn Michael: Yeah. Hey, Greg, I'm going to start very briefly and then I'll turn it over to Andi and Debbie. But I wanted just -- I want to say, no one-off items in the quarter. I mean, this was -- what was great about this quarter is that, it was just really awesome to see the team deliver a real clean, kind of high quality quarter of profitability. So there's nothing notable in terms of one-offs. And I don't know, Debbie, if you want to unpack that any further?\nAndi Owen: Yeah, I would give kudos to the team this quarter and for the last year, Greg, and really knuckling down and delivering strategic execution and they really did that this quarter. But again, no one-time, this is well done. Why don't you add Debbie?\nDebbie Propst: Hi, Greg, it's Debbie. So a few things that I would just highlight. The first is we've been extremely focused on our foundational execution over the last 24 months and we're really starting to see some of the operational investments and improvements we've made paying off. That's driving up customer lifetime value. We're improving across all of our operational metrics. We had our fastest shipped lead times ever within the quarter, and that is in fact freeing up more time and capacity in our stores to focus on selling activity instead of post-purchase activity. The second thing is our marketing effectiveness. We actually spent 11% less in marketing expenses year-over-year and our organic sales are down 3%. So we got really nice leverage out of our marketing capabilities. That's driven by the beginnings of optimizing the customer data platform, we stood up in the last year. And then in terms of our promotional posture, that obviously drove really nice progress. We had our best month ever in November. November up 5% to last year in organic orders. That was really driven by the position we took to capture as much demand late in the quarter as possible. We've seen a shift over the last three years of customers waiting till later and later in the month to purchase. And so we wanted to be agile and have a promotional strategy that we could stair-step depending on the customer behavior we saw. And we managed that business in real-time to make sure that we were driving demand into our most profitable categories. So we're really proud of the demand trends versus the industry in the quarter. We're really also proud of the margin trends and we expect to see forward-looking trends from a margin perspective in line.\nGregory Burns: Okay, great. And then, Jeff, the interest in other expense line item, I think your guidance around $19 million or $20 million to come in, it came in at $16 million and you're guiding to that for the next quarter. What's driving the decrease there?\nJeff Stutz: Yeah, the biggie is, we generated some good amounts of cash. I said in the prepared remarks, we've been pleased with working capital efficiency and that's helped generate cash not just in the US, but in a variety of jurisdictions around the world. And what we benefited from was higher interest rates, particularly outside the US, driving interest income. So that was a biggie below the line. That was a positive. We also had a slight currency -- good news on the currency line, which we tend to -- currency transaction gains and losses, we tend to guide those as flat. We had a slight gain and some good news related to an international pension plan. So it was really those three things.\nGregory Burns: Okay, great. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Budd Bugatch of Water Tower Research. Your line is open.\nBudd Bugatch: Good evening, Andi.\nAndi Owen: Hi, Budd.\nBudd Bugatch: Yes, hi. Happy New Year and Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to everybody there.\nAndi Owen: Thank you.\nBudd Bugatch: I guess and congratulations on the margin performance. It's very nice. And I guess, Jeff, my first question is the 30s -- nearly 34% gross margin in Americas. Can you hang on to that given that the backlog continues to be -- looks depressed to me and that your comment about leverage is one that I worry about?\nJeff Stutz: Yeah, but I think over the -- more than just one quarter, we're rolling into our -- as you know this very well, we're rolling into what is historically a seasonal low quarter from a manufacturing volume perspective. And that tends to drive some reduction in gross margin. But that's in the best of times. We see that in this business. So I think it would be fair to say that in the Americas segment will we see a slight sequential step down in margin performance? I think that's reasonable to expect and that's implied in our guidance for the quarter. But like-for-like to Q2 going forward, we don't see anything in this performance that we don't think we can hold on to. I mean, obviously we're keeping an eye on discounting pressure in the business and I think we've seen some signs of it on the edges, but nothing significant. That's of great concern. And as we see larger project opportunities, those are going to be priced more aggressively, that always happens. But with that comes more manufacturing production and an opportunity to leverage. So nothing that causes us any great concern there.\nBudd Bugatch: So in contract, the normal, as I recall, in normal times, the discounting impact used to be about 50 basis points or that's what was discussed. Is that what is normal and what you're expecting?\nJeff Stutz: You know, it's funny. I don't know that I think of it in terms of basis points. I mean, that doesn't strike me as crazy, but I'm kind of going from memory. I don't have any data from history in front of me. Typically you do see some contraction in margins and it can happen in short bursts until the volume picks up and you start to be able to offset that with opportunity growth. And that's why these forward indicators that we've been following closely are so important and have us fairly optimistic.\nBudd Bugatch: And the difference between orders and shipments in the Americas implies about a $40 million drawdown of the ending backlog from the beginning backlog in the quarter. And I'll ask you, is that correct? And that strikes me as a number that I haven't seen that low, and I don't remember when. So help me understand, when do you start building that back? And it was nice to see you come back in retail. And I know international is down a little bit, but Americas was significant from what I can see from the numbers.\nJeff Stutz: I think your numbers are right, Budd. That's correct. And I think that puts us down about 15% or 16% year-on-year in the Americas segment backlog. The number sounds right.\nBudd Bugatch: I think 19% is the number I look at it. It's like around the 380 level versus 470, I think it was at the end of Q2 of last year.\nJeff Stutz: Just under 384.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. Yeah, 383. Yeah, okay. And that's about -- and yeah, that's a big number, and that worries me. I mean a small number. So when do we start seeing that build? I was hoping that maybe that's the real thing, because I think that's the key here?\nJeff Stutz: Yeah, I mean, you know, clearly we're watching that closely, too. I think the best indicators we have are what we've already highlighted and the fact that we've seen some -- a nice improvement in the order -- year-on-year order comparisons in the month of November and thus far through two weeks of Q3. So that's -- I mean at the end of the day, order growth is what it's going to take to drive that. And so far, we like what we see as we close the quarter and move into Q3.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay, I'm rooting for you. So, yeah, that's what I would like to see. Okay, well, Happy New Year to everybody there and stay warm if you can.\nJeff Stutz: Same to you, Budd. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. We now turn the floor over back to President and CEO, Andi Owen for any closing remarks.\nAndi Owen: Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone again for joining us on today's call. In closing, we're very proud of the resilience demonstrated by our collective of brands and the continued progress we're making through our integration work and product innovation. We appreciate your continued interest in MillerKnoll and we look forward to updating you again next quarter. On behalf of all of us here at MillerKnoll, I want to wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

With that, I will turn the call over to Andi. Andi?\nAndi Owen: Thanks, Carola. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'm very excited to share that our team delivered a strong first quarter, as evidenced by our top-line results and margin expansion. Across our enterprise, we have set ourselves up to seize opportunity as market conditions improve, and we believe we are at an inflection point. Now regarding our continuing strategy, I'd like to highlight some of the efforts we're making to become more resilient and future-proof our business, including diversifying our business both in North America and globally, streamlining our global operations, moving production and capacity efficiently and investing in e-commerce. We believe that the work we're doing is paying off with much to look forward to on the horizon. At the same time, we remain pragmatic about the next few months. We're still in the early period of recovery, and our business segments reflect a varied economic conditions around the globe. Right now, we have cause for both enthusiasm and vigilance. We've seen companies begin to take the leap back into physical space and announced return to office policies. Office leasing in the US began to rebound in the second quarter of 2023, and we're seeing this amongst our clients as companies continue to announce return to office policies. Moreover, the American Institute of Architects' Billing Index, or ABI, has been flat for the last six months, suggesting a slow, but stable construction outlook. Having said that, we're still seeing mortgage rates at 20-year highs and uncertainty remains about future rate hikes, which dampens the housing market and impacts the near term in our Retail segment. Overall, we remain focused on economic and industry activity worldwide so that we can continue to deliver with our customers and clients value most. Our research and insights team is best-in-class, bringing the latest data and learning to our customers. This fall, we'll be sharing our latest point of view on the workplace and defining ideal spaces based on quality and actionable data. This fresh, thoughtful perspective emphasizes what we believe are the key factors to designing the best basis to support thriving and engaged teams. Internationally, we're seeing some pockets of softness, mainly centered in Europe and China. Similar to North America and the rest of world were further pursuing resilient sectors and global accounts. We've seen that our scalability and ability to deliver a wider range of products as a unique market advantage, and we'll continue to seek out these wins. In addition, over the next 12 months, we plan to transition 60 more international Herman Miller dealers into MillerKnoll dealers, expanding our offering to clients and our share of wallet with our dealers. Regarding Retail, the deceleration in the North American housing market and the upswing in interest rates across Europe have continued to influence demand in this segment when compared to the previous year. Nevertheless, during the quarter, the order trajectory in the North American market surpassed that of other regions, primarily attributed to enhancements in our direct-to-consumer channel. We're strategically allocating resources to improve our digital platforms and technological infrastructure, aiming to enhance the overall customer experience and satisfaction levels, all while intensifying their efforts to fortify brand awareness. Furthermore, in the first quarter, we opened a new design within REIT store in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, which has delivered very promising early results, including robust foot traffic and order placement. Now I'd like to talk a little bit about our gross margins. It expanded year-over-year sequentially and across all of our business segments. In the past, I've talked about focusing on what we can control, and this performance is proof of that. We're seeing efficiency improvements derived from our synergy capture. We have pricing power. We're laser focused on inventory management and product mix, and we continue to seek cost reductions. All of these key elements that are enabling us to improve the profitability of our core operations. I'm extremely proud of all the work our teams have done and continue to do every day to seek and seize opportunities. Finally, this quarter was not short on activity, so I'll walk you through a few of the highlights. We started out strong with a successful phase, the largest North American presentation of our MillerKnoll collective of contract products and services. Throughout the quarter, we debuted new products and textiles across our collective, including NaughtOne 's Morse Table System, which was awarded Gold by Best of NeoCon, Herman Miller's first collaboration with Gabriel Tan launching the Luva Modular Sofa and Cyclade Tables as well as the beautiful array of textiles from our textiles group, many with sustainable fabrics at the forefront. The HAY team launched a collection of lamps and other ancillary items. Holly Hunt celebrated their 40th anniversary with a collection of beautiful pieces. At Knoll, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Iconic Womb Chair, while also introducing the Saarinen Table at a modern Lounge height. We re-launched Herman Miller archival classics, all with fresh interpretation, and we made significant progress towards our sustainability goals, bringing solar power to our UK operations facility. All-in-all, I'm pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Our team is connecting and moving the business forward in exciting creative ways and we're capturing market share and growth opportunities as they arrive. While I believe the rest of fiscal year 2024 will remain a transitional year, economic indicators trending more positively pockets of weakness remaining. I'm confident in our ability to deliver shareholder value as we are operating efficiently and making decisions to further improve our margins and profitability. I'm looking forward to progressing towards our goals, positively impacting our industry and advancing our strategy to remain resilient and ready for the future. With that, I want to thank you for your continued partnership with us. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff for a deeper look at our financials.\nJeff Stutz: Thank you, Andi, and good evening, everyone. As Andi just said, we are proud that our teams delivered a very strong quarter. The results reflect some of the themes that we've been communicating over the past several quarters. First, our focus on diversification, both across geographies, business sectors and customer segments; and second, our focus on margins, taking action across several fronts. For the first quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $0.37 per share, which were $0.16 above the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, strong net sales and gross margin expansion across all of our business segments drove the over-performance. Net sales in the first quarter were $918 million, above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by strong performance in the Americas Contract segment. Our consolidated gross margin was 39%, which was 450 basis points higher than the same quarter a year ago and also improved on a sequential period basis. Moreover, this marks the third consecutive quarter of consolidated year-over-year adjusted gross margin expansion. As Andi mentioned, several factors contributed to this, including the realization of price increases, ongoing benefits from integration-related synergies and positive shifts in product and channel mix. Our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 6% for the period. Turning to cash flows in the balance sheet. This quarter, we generated approximately $131 million in cash flow from operations. This represents an increase of nearly $200 million compared to the same quarter last year, mostly driven by working capital improvements. As a result of this, we were able to retire $66 million of debt and took the opportunity to repurchase approximately 1.7 million shares for a total cash outlay of $31.7 million. We finished the first quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times, which puts us comfortably under the maximum limit defined in our lender agreements. New orders at the consolidated level totaled $914 million in the first quarter, reflecting an organic decrease of 1.3% from the same quarter last year. While this is lower from last year on an absolute basis, the rate of year-over-year decrease once again improved this quarter. Within our Americas Contract segment, net sales in the period were $490 million, representing an organic decrease of 1.7% from the same quarter last year. New orders in the period totaled $487 million, which was up 2.1% over last year. This is particularly encouraging as it's the first time in four quarters we've reported an increase in order levels in the Americas segment. I'd also like to highlight the fact that our Americas Contract team delivered another quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margin, which totaled 10.6% in the quarter. Turning to our International Contract and Specialty segment. Net sales for the quarter totaled $228 million, down 10.9% organically year-over-year, while new orders came in at $228 million, reflecting a year-over-year organic decrease of 3.6%. While we continue to be very optimistic about the medium to long-term growth potential in this segment, near-term macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in China and parts of Europe, are impacting demand. Adjusted operating margin within this segment was 6.5% in the first quarter, down year-over-year, driven by lower sales volume. This was partially offset by improved gross margin performance, which continues to benefit from previous price increases and our cost synergy program. Moving to our Global Retail segment. Net sales in the first quarter of $199 million, were down 13.6% organically from the same quarter last year. New orders in this segment of $199 million were 6.4% lower than a year ago on an organic basis. While the slowdown in the North American housing market and the rise in interest rates globally continue to affect the demand for this segment compared to last year. We are optimistic about the progress our team is making in expanding our market share through our direct-to-consumer channels, given the relative order performance of some of our competitors. And as such, we are further positioning our most mature retail brands as preferred choices for authentic design. Adjusted operating margin in the Retail segment was 1.6%, down year-over-year, mainly due to a combination of lower volume and product mix. Now turning to our near-term guidance and outlook. Given the improvements we are seeing in gross margins across each of our business segments and continued signs of demand stabilization in our North American Contract business, we are increasing our adjusted earnings guidance for the full fiscal year, which we now expect to range between $1.85 and $2.15 per share. As it relates to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect net sales to range between $950 million and $990 million and adjusted diluted earnings to be between $0.52 and $0.58 per share. And I'd point out that this guidance takes into consideration the relative seasonal increase in sales that we expect to experience in our Retail segment from the first quarter to the second quarter of our fiscal year. So with that overview of the numbers, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Water Tower Research. Your line is open.\nBudd Bugatch: Thank you and good evening, Andi, Jeff, Carola, John and Debbie. Hey, congratulations on the margin performance in the quarter. I would love to start, but just by punching into the order flow during the quarter, if you can make some commentary of how that went particularly in Americas Contract? I think if I caught your drift, you're saying we're seeing some improvement in that. And did that show up late in the quarter? And how has the second quarter started?\nJeff Stutz: Yeah, Budd. Good evening. This is Jeff. I'll start and then John and Andi, if anyone please add as you see fit. So maybe just on the Americas segment in particular, so order activity in the first half of the quarter was positive, Budd, and showed some signs of slowing in August and the first couple of weeks of September. Now with that being said, the timing of last year's price increase, which, as a reminder, was 8% at the start of October a year ago would certainly be expected to make September's comparisons much more difficult in the current year. But when we zoom out from that week-to-week data, the general trends over the past three quarters have shown improved demand activity, and that gives us some confidence that more consistent growth is around the corner. So it was a bit choppy in August and early September. I think we're seeing some of that bump up against the tough comps from last year due to the sizable price increase we put in place at the beginning of October, but I'll pause there. And John, anything you have?\nJohn Michael: Thanks, Jeff. I'd just add, if we looked at additions to the funnel for the quarter, we had, I think, the second largest volume of additions to the funnel that we've had in the last 12 quarters. So from a project activity perspective, we're still seeing a fair amount of activity. And we've seen the day-to-day business maintain a steady pace as well. So I think to your point, Jeff, a lot of opportunity. I think we're seeing some regional differences, right, in terms of strength of markets, but overall, very positive.\nBudd Bugatch: That's interesting because we had heard and I'm sure you're aware that maybe project activity had lessened in the quarter and day-to-day business had replaced that. Is that not what you're seeing? Is that varying with what you're seeing?\nJohn Michael: We're seeing the day-to-day activity maintain a steady solid pace. And in terms of new project adds to the funnel, it's been very robust for the last 90 days.\nBudd Bugatch: Got you. Okay. And in Retail, what are you seeing, Debbie? Are you seeing any indication that maybe we're at the bottom and not getting any much worse or bouncing along the bottom?\nDebbie Propst: So, Budd, just from an order pacing perspective throughout the quarter, we actually saw a very strong August. We attribute softness that we saw in June and July, obviously, to the macroeconomic conditions, but also the heightened travel spend during the summer months. And on an adjusted basis, our August order performance was actually flat to last year. So we feel like we have momentum. Additionally, we believe, as we look at benchmarks externally, we're taking share, given the increased performance of our marketing tactics and all the other investments that we're making to improve our efficiencies and how we engage with the customer.\nAndi Owen: I think one of the really important point. Hi, Budd, it's Andi, about the Retail business is also the relative strength that we're seeing in the North America Retail segment where we are seeing momentum and demand pick up compared to the past few quarters, and that's encouraging since it's one of our largest segments.\nDebbie Propst: And the segment that we have a direct-to-consumer more mature strategy, our business internationally is largely wholesale where we have limitations with open to buy of the wholesale partners that we sell into.\nBudd Bugatch: So you're seeing better DTC than you're seeing in-store, is that what I understand?\nDebbie Propst: We think about our direct-to-consumer business as both our store business and our e-commerce business. We also have a wholesale business, which is the sell-in of our products into third-party retail partners. Our direct-to-consumer business is performing much more resiliently right now, given the more agility we have and the levers we can deploy in that piece of our business versus in our wholesale business.\nBudd Bugatch: And I think we said this, and that was my understanding that your wholesale business is primarily offshore, not domestic.\nDebbie Propst: Primarily international.\nAndi Owen: Yes. That's correct, Budd.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. A couple of other things. You've raised the earnings guidance for the year. And I think when you were giving that guidance at the end of the fiscal year, you also mentioned a sales expectation modestly below that you're just reported. Any update on that sales expectation for the full year, Jeff?\nJeff Stutz: Yes. Well, I think, we're largely in the same place. I mean we're several quarters out to end of fiscal. I think what we wanted to make sure we signaled here is that the over-performance that we delivered in Q1, we believe we can take that to the bottom line full year. I don't think there's a meaningful change in the outlook from a revenue perspective. But we were intentionally vague, as you remember, at the end of the year when we talked about the revenue guide. So I think we're basically in the same place.\nBudd Bugatch: I do. I do remember. And last --\nAndi Owen: Of course, you feel bad.\nBudd Bugatch: Sorry, that's just -- it's a fault that I just -- I'm trying to overcome. Last for me is the restructuring. Can you give us a little bit of color on what that is and where it is in the process? Do you still see more restructuring charges in the upcoming quarters? And is it primarily on the salary, the compensation side?\nJeff Stutz: Yes. So Budd, maybe a point of clarity. So we have total charges in the quarter that I'll call for purposes of the discussion, special charges that totaled about $15 million. A subset of those costs were true restructuring-related expenses that tied to workforce reduction actions that are both here in the US and some international that have already been announced and implemented. I can't say that we have other imminent plans for further restructuring. Obviously, we will react to business conditions like we always do. The remainder of the cost, so the restructuring component of that was about $5 million. The balance that you see there in the total charges for the quarter continue to relate to cost to achieve and integration-related costs related to our synergy capture program. And those costs, Budd, are just ongoing in-flight integration projects. We're nearing the end of the process, as we -- our full target is a three-year goal, and that would essentially be at the end of Q1 of next fiscal year would be that three-year mark. And we're at a point now where most of the remaining in-flight projects are either consolidation related to showroom or some manufacturing-related moves that are planned. So you've got a combination of operating expenses from showroom moves that should be further synergies as well as cost of goods sold impact related to some of the factory work that we've got in place. So you'll see some more of that over the balance of this fiscal year as we complete those projects.\nBudd Bugatch: So we'll continue to see the integration side. We know the amortization of PI. That's going to continue. The restructuring, you will do that as you find projects and things that you're going to -- that may affect. And I understand this is quite sensitive compensation and workforce. But those are not yet announced. Is that the way to understand it?\nJeff Stutz: That is correct. Nor do we have necessarily plans to announce them so. Again, we'll react to business conditions as we move through the balance of the year.\nBudd Bugatch: Understood. Okay. Thank you very much. I'll let others proceed. Thank you.\nJeff Stutz: Thanks, Budd.\nAndi Owen: Thanks, Budd.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti. Your line is open.\nGregory Burns: Good afternoon. In North America now that we're nearing the end of the integration process, how has the consolidation of the dealer networks gone? Are we at the point now where they're fully up to speed and generating the level of productivity that you would expect them to? Or is there still a level of learning curve that they need to move up to sell the full portfolio of products? Thanks.\nAndi Owen: Yes. I mean I would say, overall, Greg, we're very pleased in North America with the pace at which our dealers and our dealer designers have learned all the product lines from the corresponding legacy companies. But I'll let John add some color to that.\nJohn Michael: Yes, I think we are really, really pleased with the way the network has come together. We had just last week 22 of our largest dealers in West Michigan, 11 originally from the Miller side, 11 from the Knoll side. Honestly, you couldn't tell who came from which camp, right? They really have meshed extremely well together. Obviously, there's a learning curve to learn the new products. And I would say if I characterize our FY'23 that learning curve, we probably started up it a bit more slowly than we expected, but we finished much stronger than we expected. We really picked up a lot of momentum throughout the course of the year. And I think we exceeded our expectations in terms of what we would call cross-sell legacy Miller dealers selling no products and vice versa. So that's -- we're really pleased with the way the networks come together.\nGregory Burns: Okay. Great. And then I understand the kind of the macro issues impacting some of the international markets. Can you just talk about what the opportunity is there to sell that -- the broader portfolio? I know you're adding dealers, but how far along are you in addressing that opportunity longer term? Are we still in the very early innings? Are we not really seeing much of that yet? And is there potential for you to offset maybe some of the macro challenges that you're seeing here with some of these organic growth initiatives?\nAndi Owen: Yes, Greg, you took the words out of my mouth. I would say that we focused our attention on North America to begin this process so that we could learn it's also our largest business. And we're now focusing on international. So we are just beginning this process. We've converted dealers. But as far as rationalizing product, learning product specs continuing to convert dealers. We see a lot of runway and opportunity, particularly in selling the Knoll -- Studio Knoll ancillary products throughout the world. So we have a long way to go there, and we're actually pretty excited about what it can offset. So more at the beginning of the process internationally.\nGregory Burns: Okay. Great. And then -- go ahead.\nAndi Owen: [indiscernible] had very limited contract dealers in the past. They really focused primarily on the interior design and retail wholesale customers. So opening up that product line to contract dealers is a new effort, and we're excited about that. Anything you would add, Jeff?\nJeff Stutz: Yes. I think, Greg, we may have mentioned this at end of year, but just recall that we've got -- I mean, this kind of builds on your comment about the dealer network that Knoll really didn't have an extensive international dealer network. And we're phasing into that MillerKnoll dealer format. And we've got about 80 of those dealers of 335 international Herman Miller dealers. 80 of them are transitioned at this point, and we expect another 60 yet this year. So we're moving forward with that in a pretty disciplined clip, I would say.\nGregory Burns: All right. Great. And then lastly, I appreciate the kind of balanced approach you're taking to capital allocation. Relative to your leverage, is there a target you're trying to get to? Are you comfortable at 2.5 times? Are you trying to reduce that any further going forward?\nJeff Stutz: Yes, Greg, Jeff. We're certainly comfortable with the 2.5 where we are not. We have said from the beginning, we intend to kind of follow a migration path or a glide path that would see that debt level come down over time. Nothing has changed on that front from our perspective. I think longer term, somewhere around two turns of leverage would seem reasonable. But some -- that also is highly influenced by the level of demand and earnings power that we see in the business. So I would just simply say we intend to continue to pay debt down as we move forward, but we're in no way fused with the leverage ratio that we have today.\nGregory Burns: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of c Garner with Benchmark. Your line is open.\nReuben Garner: Andi, good evening. Good evening, everybody.\nAndi Owen: Hey, Reuben\nJeff Stutz: Hey, Reuben\nReuben Garner: So Andi, you mentioned an inflection point. I was curious if you could elaborate on that. Is that an inflection in MillerKnoll specifically? Is it -- was that a profitability comment? Was that a macro perspective? Anything that you can kind of give on that comment would be helpful.\nAndi Owen: Yes. It's really a macro perspective and also the sentiment that we're hearing from our customers from CEOs and from research that we've done around returning to office, around spending time together, I think that we are seeing a lot more of our clients finding ways to bring people back together, finding ways to utilize their space. I think the world has moved through a cycle of remote to hybrid to flexibility. And I think as John talked about new projects and new demand in the funnel that return and I think CEO sentiment around the return has turned to the majority in favor of being together more often, and that works well for us, and we're excited about that. That's what I meant.\nReuben Garner: And so that project funnel that John referenced, what about the willingness and maybe this goes into your inflection point comment? Are you seeing a change in the willingness to kind of pull the trigger on those projects? Or is it still kind of that planning and thinking about the new way of work phase?\nAndi Owen: Yes. We're seeing more confidence in decision-making. The less CEOs and decision-makers waiting to see what everyone else is doing and sort of boldly going into what's right for their organization, obviously, with some help in guidance from us. And the decision points, I don't think there is short and John, please add to this, as short as they used to be pre-COVID, but they've certainly shortened substantially from where they were six months to a year ago. What would you add, John?\nJohn Michael: I would agree, Andi, in that the -- there is still a lot of iterating that goes on before the plan is finally complete. So people are -- really want to make sure that they get it right. But I would add to that, there is a growing sense of urgency among CEOs and leaders maybe even a sense of frustration on this topic, which to Andi's point, is sort of a catalyst for activity and to kind of get off the fence on some of these projects and make decisions. So obviously, that's positive for us and for our industry.\nReuben Garner: Great. And Jeff, sorry if I missed this, but can we give an update on where we are in the price/cost, journey. I know you guys had an increase out as recently as this summer, I believe? Are the current kind of double-digit margin run rates that you're seeing in the Americas fully reflecting your price cost? Have you gotten your margin back or is there still kind of room to run there?\nJeff Stutz: Yes, Reuben, I would say it this way. So yes, you are correct. First of all, I'll confirm we did have an increase that was effective. John, keep me honest here was July or beginning of July. So we -- and it was a certainly not the 8% and 10% that we had been seeing in years. Recent years past, it was closer to 3% on average. So more akin to typical history of price increases. And that will take some time to layer in. And so we think there's some further upside there. I want to maybe take this as an opportunity to highlight the fact that the synergy plan that we have been spending so much time in effort on over the past two-plus years. We have been working hard in the background and market conditions have been such that it's largely masked all -- so much of that work. And I think what you're seeing now and you see in the Americas business, we were 800-plus basis points of gross margin expansion year-on-year this quarter. That's a big deal. And I attribute that it's pricing, it's price cost factors, as you highlight, for sure. Those have come back in our favor a bit, and we still have a little room to run there, I believe. But the synergy plan is layering in and you heard my comments a few minutes ago on the remaining projects, we think there's still some room for further margin expansion there. Now the precondition for that has always been in this business, you have to have some level of demand support. And so that's why we will continue to watch the macro picture very closely, as you can imagine. But if we get some support there, we think the table is set for even some further margin expansion as we move forward.\nReuben Garner: You stole my thunder. That was my follow-up question. So I think I'll end with stock repurchase. I believe that was the largest repurchase we've seen in some time for the quarter. Maybe just update us on what you're thinking is there? Is that something we'll continue to see if the stock kind of remains at these levels? It seems to speak to your confidence that maybe we're turning a corner here and the stuff is not reflective of that, but I don't want to put words in your mouth?\nAndi Owen: Yes, I would say we believe we're oversold, but I think we have a very balanced perspective on capital allocation. We'll continue to pay down debt. But if we continue to see opportunistic time to purchase our stock, we'll do that too. We believe that's a great return for our shareholders, and we believe in the future.\nReuben Garner: Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the strong results and good luck.\nJeff Stutz: Thanks, Reuben.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nAlex Fuhrman: Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Most of my questions were asked here earlier, but I guess just to -- take a look at the full year guidance, I mean, definitely much better-than-expected results in Q1 and guided to for Q2 on the bottom line. Certainly don't mean this to sound nit-picky or anything, but it looks like the degree to which you beat Q1 estimates and Q2 wasn't maybe fully flowed through to the full year. Is that just being a little bit conservative? Or are you may be expecting that some of the headwinds you mentioned on a macro basis related to things like housing in China and Europe? Is that expected to offset some of the gains that you've seen with gross margin and your North America business maybe in the back half of the year?\nAndi Owen: Yes. As I said earlier on, Alex, I think we're super enthusiastic, but we are also pragmatic and vigilant. I think we live in a very dynamic world right now. And while we have enthusiasm and optimism, we do have China that hasn't come back as quickly as we like. We have a European consumer who has mortgages where interest rates are not fixed who's not necessarily back in the wholesale market. So we're watching these things very closely. And while we feel very strongly about our diversified business model and our ability to offset these things, we want to make sure we have the right mix of enthusiasm and pragmatism.\nAlex Fuhrman: Okay. That's makes a lot of sin. Thanks you very much, Andi.\nAndi Owen: Thank you\nOperator: There are no further questions. We turn the floor back to President and CEO, Andi Owen for any closing remarks.\nAndi Owen: Thank you so much guys for joining us on the call. We really appreciate your continued support of MillerKnoll and we look forward to updating you on our next quarterly call. Have a great night.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
