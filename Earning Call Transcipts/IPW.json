In our fiscal second quarter, we continue to expand gross margin, drive down operating costs and generated another period of positive cash flow from operations. We also gained further traction in our SuperSuite supply chain business, which represents an exciting opportunity for us as we continue to work through a robust pipeline of prospects with compelling product portfolios. Due to the improvement in the supply chain environment, our largest channel partner, has progressively tightened their inventory management as shipping lead times have become more favorable. Although our order volumes were impacted for the quarter, we believe this channel partner's inventory is now at the preferred level, and we are well equipped to meet the demand with the high-quality market leading products that our customers expect. Over the past several quarters, we have placed a strong emphasis on diversifying revenue, showcased by the launch of our SuperSuite supply chain offerings. We have also created a strong brand presence on social channel -- commerce channel like TikTok shop, where we are an approved seller for both short-form videos and live shopping. Although the sales channel is now in its infancy, the early results are compelling, and we will continue to invest in the channel as it grows both in the U.S. and abroad. As I mentioned earlier, we are building positive momentum in our SuperSuite business, which is growing at a strong clip. The acceleration of revenue alongside a growing pipeline of prospects, reflects the strength of our superior supply chain, warehousing and merchandising expertise. We are optimistic about this area of our business and hope to have a few more partners in the coming quarters. In addition to evaluating new partners for our SuperSuite business, we have also continued to pursue additional sales channel in the U.S. to expand our reach, diversify our client base and explore omnichannel opportunities. For example, we currently have relationships with Home Depot and Lowe's, allowing us to sell product through their captive e-commerce sites. Although we have initiated the -- with a small subset of our categories, we believe our portfolio is well aligned with Lowe's and Home Depot's in-store and online customer base. We are optimistic that these partnerships will bring future omnichannel opportunities, specifically in brick-and-mortar. We look forward to deepening our relationship with Lowe's, Home Depot and other current partners as well as expanding into new channels across the United States. Turning to OpEx. We continue to drive material savings in our selling and fulfillment operations. We no longer bear the burden of additional warehousing expenses as we have sold through the bulk of our excess inventory. With the normalization of supply chain, we can run our business with lower levels of inventory, specifically due to faster overseas shipping lead times. As of December 31, we have brought down inventory level by 23% compared to June 30, 2023. We have also begun to outsource our warehouse staffing to a third party, lowering our production overhead we will -- we expect to realize cost savings from this initiative over the medium to long run. Looking ahead, we will continue to evaluate each segment of our business to ensure our cost structure is both lean and position for future growth. We are seeing early signs of normalized order volume with our largest channel partner and look forward to continue providing them with our high-quality products. These actions, coupled with the acceleration of our SuperSuite business, will enable us to deliver on our goals with the aim of returning to profitability in 2024. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevin Vassily, and take you through our financial results in more detail. Kevin?\nKevin Vassily: Thanks, Lawrence. Unless referenced otherwise, all variants commentary is in comparison to the prior quarter last year, so let me dive into the fiscal Q2 results. Total revenue was $16.8 million compared to $19.3 million in the prior period last year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower promotional activity as compared to last year, given our normalized inventory level right now as well as lower order volumes from our largest channel partner who is more tightly managing inventory levels due to the improved supply chain environment and shorter lead times to receive product. This was partially offset by growth in our SuperSuite supply chain business. Gross profit in the fiscal quarter of 2024 was $7.3 million compared to $8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin increased 220 basis points to 43.6% compared to 41.4% in the year-ago period. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by favorable product mix as we have worked through the bulk of our higher-priced inventory. Total operating expenses for fiscal Q2 improved 18% to $9.9 million compared to $12.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower selling fulfillment and marketing expenses. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we've reduced our warehousing space now that we can keep lower levels of inventory on hand given the improved supply chain environment. Net loss attributable to iPower in the fiscal second quarter improved 42% to $1.9 million or $0.06 per share loss compared to a net loss of $3.3 million or $0.11 per share loss for the same period in fiscal 2023. The improvement in net loss was driven primarily by the higher gross margin and lower operating expenses. Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $3.7 million in June of 2023. Total debt stood at $5 million compared to $11.8 million as of June 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by our continued efforts to pay down debt, resulted in a 56% reduction in net debt to $3.6 million compared to $8.1 million as of June 30, 2023. And for both fiscal Q2 and year-to-date, we continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. As Lawrence mentioned above, the work we put in place to reduce our supply of high-cost inventory and optimize our cost structures to -- sorry, continues to bear fruit as we have achieved another period of 40% plus gross margins and some meaningful OpEx savings. In addition, we reduced total debt by approximately $2 million compared to the last quarter, demonstrating our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet where we can. Between these efforts, we've built a foundation to continue to deliver on our growth objectives and profitability objectives in 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Fortune from ROTH. Your line is open.\nScott Fortune: Yes, good afternoon and thanks for the questions. You mentioned lower promotional activity and tightened inventory by your largest channel partner leading to kind of the lower order volumes here. Did seasonality play into this? And where are we kind of in the progression of reaching normalized levels? We just want to get a sense of how you're viewing the overall health of the consumer and the sustainable trends kind of in your non-hydroponic category. And a follow-up on that and looking at the kind of do-it-yourself hydroponics side of the business. Has that stabilized? Or is sales still decreasing in that segment with the nonhydroponic sales as a percentage increasing the overall mix? And just kind of follow up on -- are you investing in the hydroponic space still? And then kind of further updates on the big partnership -- big box partnerships, you mentioned Lowe's and Home Depot and kind of meaningfully moving that forward? Sorry, a lot there, but just kind of get a sense for this quarter's revenue and kind of normalization where we can expect that kind of moving forward here?\nKevin Vassily: Sure. Right. Yes. Go ahead, Lawrence, take the first, and then I'd like to add in after.\nLawrence Tan: Okay. So we start -- the first -- to answer your question, I think the inventory level from our channel partner now normalized. I think in the level where they will start to ordering on a pre-pandemic paces. So we have seen inventories being piled up. We have seen the reduction inventory efforts. And now I believe the sample quarter finally to reduce the level to a pretty normalized level that we prefer to see. So that's pretty healthy. The second question for hydroponics. The hydroponics overall market has been pretty stable for us over the past couple of years. I don't see the sales drop, but I don't think it will substantially expand in the near future. It will more go with the overall bigger market segment. By saying that during the pandemic, we have captured some of the market share even though the whole market segment has gone down and have been able to keep the sales in dollar amount. But as the organization grow, the percentage of hydroponics will keep decreasing as it does not grow as fast as other parts of the organization. Is that -- does that answer your question?\nScott Fortune: Yes. Just a follow-up on the big box partnerships you mentioned. Is that going to become more meaningful here in 2024? How do you view that?\nLawrence Tan: It's still in the early days. We're making slow progress, but steady. That was the right direction. We have built relationships and we have got vendor IDs, and we've been working with multiple vendors through the online platform first. Should the online sales take off, and it will naturally introduce our product into their preferred buying for their off-line sales channel, meaning going to the store. So it's work in progress compared to 12 months ago, where we had nothing. Now we have sales, we have channels. It's just -- I think it's making good progress.\nKevin Vassily: Scott, it's Kevin. Just real quickly on the -- your first question as it pertains to seasonality, too. So I think we've talked about this before and -- with you. The December quarter has historically been our weakest quarter seasonally. The reference to promotional activity was with reference to last year's December quarter. If you recall, we entered that December quarter pretty close to our peak in inventory levels. And we were pretty aggressive at promoting portions of that product catalog in an effort to bring that inventory level down. So the December quarter last year probably was a little stronger than it would have otherwise been had we not been so promotional. Now that our inventory levels are back to what we think is a healthy level, we made the decision in this quarter not to promote because we are trying to make progress getting back to that breakeven and then to the kind of profitability threshold. And so I think that -- those were the two drivers as it pertains to kind of what happened last year and kind of the seasonality of the business.\nScott Fortune: I appreciate that color. That's helpful. And then shifting gears kind of, obviously, last year, you rolled out the business services offering and you brought on two partners. But can you provide more of an update on the SuperSuite supply chain growth and the partnerships kind of moving forward here? I believe last quarter, you were generating about $600,000 a month or about $7 million annualized in revenue run rate. Just a little additional color on the next steps or the traction of offering by adding new partnerships and what categories are really taking more interest from that side of the business here?\nKevin Vassily: Yes. Lawrence, why don't you take that as it pertains to kind of who we're looking at and kind of what we think could happen over the next couple of quarters.\nLawrence Tan: Yes. That part of the business has been growing. It's been growing substantially quarter-over-quarter. And for the existing partners, we've been working well -- particularly well with a lot of them. And I believe we'll expand our portfolio with more consumer electronics as well as some other consumer goods, including food and beverage. We have signed more supply chain in the food and beverage part. That part -- I think SuperSuite is working well to -- as planned.\nScott Fortune: Got it. Okay. And last one for me, just on the operational side. Obviously, you're up against higher cost inventory, higher inflation costs -- freight, you mentioned, warehousing. But that seems to all be cleared now. Are we going to see kind of steadily improvement in margins, just kind of provide an update on the gross margin drivers here? And then kind of the cadence throughout '24. But more importantly, as you bring on higher service margins there, the improvement towards returning to profitability. And any color or view on the timing of profitability throughout '24 here?\nKevin Vassily: Sure. Let me take that. So we don't give specific guidance. I think we're still committed to the goal of getting to profitability in 2024. I think the things that we've put in place to help take expense out where we can, aren't short-term fixes, but we're making progress. On one front, I'll talk about the cost of product. We've put in place a number of initiatives with some of our key contract manufacturing partners to help lower the cost of goods sold for us, which will, over time, provide us with even healthier gross margins. I think that's one of the areas where given our experience with the supply chain and our long relationships there, our ability to improve on that front is a real one, one. And secondly, we've never been either the lowest cost provider or the highest premium provider.  We've been -- we like to call kind of the sweet spot of value for customers, which means our prices do have some room to go up if we choose to selectively do that. So there are some areas where we could pursue and will pursue very small price increases that will help also boost that gross margin line. So while there's going to be variability from quarter-to-quarter, we still feel good about the idea that we can get -- continue to push gross margins upward from here. So that's one area. Secondly, we are working on a number of other initiatives on the OpEx side that we think can help bring costs down as well. One that I think we can talk about is we've engaged with another kind of logistics/shipping partner, where we feel like we can take meaningful cost out of the cost of shipping product out to customers that we just kind of inked a contract over the last -- probably in the last two months. And so as the balance of this calendar year rolls out, some of that cost savings will roll through as well. So I think the foundation has been laid and -- to continue to improve. But I mean, you hit on a pretty important point. Some of the hard work is in the rearview mirror for us now. We have reduced that inventory. Our inventory now sits at a more normalized level. Aside from some pockets, we haven't completely cleared all of it out, but we can believe some of the rest of that out in a way that won't be hugely detrimental. And then just the cost of operating with that lower inventory accrues benefits to us as well. So I still think that we see profitability kind of on the horizon. The question will be how quickly we get to that horizon, but it's there. So we're optimistic.\nScott Fortune: Thank you. I appreciate the update.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Thierry Wuilloud from Water Tower Research. Your line is open.\nShawn Severson: Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Shawn Severson in for Thierry. Just had a question about the move into kind of the bricks-and-mortar side. And when you're talking about going from online to in retail. What are some of the criteria that you're looking at over the near term? I guess, how would that rollout look? And are there certain metrics or decisions that need to be made by the retailers or what's the framework for a rollout there?\nLawrence Tan: Once the -- it's pretty much based on two things. One is the sales on particular SKUs. Now once the sales become a certain volume -- the retailer will have the data to support their decision-making. Now secondly is the product road map, how well, the line of products that we can bring in, in the future as well, not just the ones that lead our way into the store. So the first -- we are working on the first step and the second step at the same time, where once the sales volume has achieved a certain level, we will get more attention than potentially some SKUs get opportunities into the store.\nShawn Severson: Now would this be just for a limited number of stores initially? Or is this kind of going to be looking across a region or a small region or large region? How would they address the size of rollout?\nLawrence Tan: It depends on specific retailers and the category manager. Usually, I think it will be a trial to a certain number of stores. And then depends on whether the product is a national product, it will go to all the stores.\nShawn Severson: Great. Thanks. And my last question is, any update on international in the quarter?\nLawrence Tan: There's nothing particular. I think it's similar to what before. There's not much that I can mention here.\nShawn Severson: Okay. Great. Thank you, gentlemen.\nLawrence Tan: Thank you, Shawn.\nOperator: One moment for any more questions. Looks like we have a follow-up from Scott Fortune from ROTH. Scott, your line is open. And there are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn it back to Kevin for any closing remarks.\nKevin Vassily: Okay. I just want to say thank you again to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter or at an upcoming conference. Thanks again. Bye.\nLawrence Tan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

With that, I’d like to turn the call now over to iPower’s Chairman and CEO, Lawrence Tan. Lawrence?\nLawrence Tan: Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon everyone. During the quarter, we continued to generate revenue growth overcoming a record comp in the year ago period. This was due to in part to the continued strong demand for our high-quality products as well as material growth in our super suite supply chain partnerships, which is now generating approximately $7 million in annualized run rate revenue. Sales of our in-house products were resilient and once again, present over 90% of our revenue. Diving deeper, we delivered strong results across the categories of fans, shelving and outdoor pergola furniture. On previous calls, we have stated our desire to diversify our product sales mix beyond hydroponics, and fiscal Q1 marked the second consecutive quarter that non-hydroponics accounted for over 75% and of the total revenue. That said, we remain committed to providing high quantity hydroponics products and will continue to invest in the space as dictated by the consumer demand. We also began to tap into social commerce channels to fortify our brand reputation, while fostering a virtuous ecosystem of content-driven drive to our product. For example, we are an approved seller of TikTok’s short-form video platform, which will allow us to leverage TikTok’s feed algorithm to present our product to the right users based on their activity. The short-form videos featuring our products present by influencers in the program will not only drive high-quality impressions but will also build a repertoire of our trusted review and testimonials. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the ramp of our super suite supply chain partnerships, which is now generating approximately $600,000 in monthly revenue. As a reminder, the goal of our super suite supply chain partnership offering is to add value to strategic partners with innovative product portfolio that could benefit from our rich expertise in supply chain, fulfillment and merchandising. The super suite business is gaining solid momentum and we are working with us through a growth pipeline of prospective partnerships. We are pleased with the early results from these efforts as well as invaluable insights that we are gaining from this accelerating area of our business. Turning to OpEx. We continue to make headway with our reduction of warehousing and inventory expenses. We are also now beginning to realize the benefit of our efforts to reduce our level of higher cost inventory through gross margin expansion. That said, at the operating levels, we have begun to see a shift in demand between sales programs at 1 of our key sales platforms, which is having an impact on operating margin. We are working through various action items and have several levers to pull to offset these fees moving forward. As we look to calendar 2024, consumer demand is resilient for our portfolio of high-quality, affordable product. We are taking the right steps to diversify our revenue mix, achieve greater operational efficiencies and have made material improvements to our balance sheet, which Kevin will highlight shortly. We are well positioned to capitalize on prospective acquisition opportunities as well, as we continue executing our profitable growth initiatives. I’ll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevin Vassily, and take you through our financial results in more detail. Kevin?\nKevin Vassily: Thanks, Lawrence. Unless referenced, otherwise, all variance commentary is compared to the prior year quarter when we dive into our fiscal Q1 results. Total revenue increased 2% to $26.5 million compared to $26 million in the prior year. The increase was driven in part by growth from our super suite supply chain offerings as well as strong sales from our in-house product portfolio. Lawrence mentioned earlier, the year ago quarter was an all-time record sales for the company. So we’re proud to have continued to drive growth on a year-over-year basis. Gross profit in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 increased 18% to $11.8 million compared to $10 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin increased 600 basis points to 44.4% compared to 38.4% in the year ago period. The increase in gross margin is primarily driven by more favorable product mix as well as having worked through much of our higher-priced inventory. Total operating expenses for fiscal Q1 improved 11% to $13 million compared to $14.6 million for the same period in 2023. Decrease was driven primarily by a $3.1 million decrease in impairment loss on goodwill, partially offset by increased selling and fulfilling expenses. Net loss attributable to iPower in the fiscal first quarter improved $1.3 million or a loss of $0.04 per share compared to a net loss of $4.2 million or a loss of $0.14 per share for the same period in fiscal 2023. The improvement in net loss was driven by the aforementioned higher gross profit and lower operating expenses. Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.7 million as of September 30, 2023, compared to $3.7 million on June 30, 2023. Total debt stood at $7 million compared to $11.8 million as of June 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by our continued efforts to pay down debt, resulted in a 48% reduction in net debt to $4.3 million as compared to $8.1 million as of June 30, 2023. Cash flow from operations for fiscal Q1 improved significantly to $4 million compared to less than $400,000 in the prior fiscal year. Increase was primarily driven by improving supply chain conditions that have allowed us to run the business with lower levels of inventory. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, our inventory levels are in better alignment with what we view as a stable state. As of September 30, we’ve successfully brought down our inventory by 26% to approximately $15 million compared to June 30, 2023. Between the warehouse savings, lower cost of goods sold to improve gross margins, coupled with we think is continued strong demand for our portfolio of in-house products as well as a promising start to our super suite business, we feel like we’ve got a strong foundation in place to continue to drive flow in 2024 and return us to profitability. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we’ll now open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Scott Fortune of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Nick on for Scott. Congrats on a good quarter. First question for me, just on TikTok. Can you step through kind of what you’re seeing as a seller on that platform just in the early days? And what products are maybe taking hold on that platform? And if you could just provide a little more color on the economics of selling on TikTok, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nLawrence Tan: Okay. There are not many sellers right now. But while I think TikTok is ramping up really quickly and will have a pretty big growth over the last 6 months on TikTok. What we sell the best is the home and kitchen goods on TikTok, while the platform have a mixed sales coming from fashion and beauty, home, kitchen and other categories. Hopefully, that’s – that answers your question.\nKevin Vassily: Yes. And Nick, on the economic side, at least right now, we – the margins that’s kind of in a normalized margin for products sold there are going to be more attractive as TikTok ramps the platform. So they’re kind of let’s call them the equivalent of the merchant account fees that we would pay in some like Amazon, their equivalent is lower at this point. They’re also subsidizing shipping on initial orders, which is also attractive. So while they haven’t really given guidance on how long kind of that attractive kind of economic model will be in place. I think we believe that they intend to make this a formidable platform in the U.S. And so that these – particularly, the subsidized shipping on initial orders and the more attractive merchant fees are going to be in place for some time, and we’re going to try to push to the extent we can to continue to drive traffic from TikTok because the economics are compelling, at least from our perspective for the foreseeable future.\nLawrence Tan: They will last for a while to compete with Tmall and Amazon, Facebook alignment. They – I don’t think it will go away any time soon.\nUnidentified Analyst: No, that makes sense. I appreciate that. And then second for me, just on the gross margin side. It’s the highest spread in several quarters. Just help us understand the cadence there. You called out mix and kind of the services business ramping. Just assuming as that side ramps, you should see ongoing accretion, just your sense of the margins moving forward here into the balance of 2024. Thanks.\nKevin Vassily: Yes. Lawrence, I will take that one. So, I will reiterate what I say every quarter, which is given the size of our product catalog and the – just the number of SKUs, the gross margin calculation is a multivariable equation. So, one thing that’s happened and is benefiting us for sure, is that we have worked through quite a bit of the higher cost inventory that we started accumulating last year. So, we are burdening those products with container costs or freight costs, those costs are much lower than they were when we built inventory last year. So, that’s certainly helping. But the other thing I would say is that in any given quarter, the mix in product sales is a function of end customer demand. And while what we have said in the past is that on average, a steady kind of state environment, our gross margins are above 40%. What sells in any given quarter can skew that up or down. This quarter, we were fortunate that a lot of our kind of individual SKUs with gross margins higher than 45% sold at a faster clip. So, I think that you will still continue to see some fluctuation over the next several quarters, for sure. But what I would say is that we think that in a steady-state environment, gross margins should stay above 40%, all things being equal. And so that’s what we will continue to work towards. But the market will dictate in any given quarter, what products we are selling and what those individual gross margins are. Hopefully, that’s helpful.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. It helps. That’s it for me. I will pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Thierry Wuilloud of Water Tower Research. Your line is open.\nThierry Wuilloud: Yes. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter. I was struck by the gross margin. I think I appreciate the explanation you gave. You mentioned in the release and in your prepared comments that you were getting some valuable insights from the SuperSuite business activity. I am curious what you mean. Is it you are getting additional data? Are you getting insight in other businesses? Can you give us some comments what that means?\nLawrence Tan: Sure. During working with the supply chain partners on the SuperSuite business side. We – as we are successfully launching a couple of partners, we started to learn through the data, how the supply chain partner operates are functioning within their organization, how they react with the market. So, it’s more on the partnership side, like the supply chain behavior and how they react with the external environment that facilitating us to work with them better so that we can utilize our strengths to help each other to success in different fields. Those are the data points we collected and formed the internal model where we can expand this side of the business in the future more successfully.\nThierry Wuilloud: Great. And you mentioned the products that are selling well on TikTok. I am curious if it’s – is it push or pull? Are you are you identifying products in your portfolio and reaching out to influencers, or is it influencers who are selecting products? How does that process work?\nLawrence Tan: Initially, we placed the products based on our understanding of the market and based on very limited data sets we can find on the platform. And then we launched – after we launched the product for a while and some products become very successful on their category and become the top performer. And initially, we look out for the influencers. Now, we have influenced actively contacting us. So, I feel like that process has become both way now, instead of like we already passed the very initial cold-start period.\nThierry Wuilloud: Okay. And then finally, you mentioned the SuperSuite is on a $7 million annualized run rate. But are you planning on adding more partners this year, or can you give us any thoughts there?\nLawrence Tan: Yes. There are pipelines of prospective partners to add on. It’s our plan to continue to expand that category. And naturally, if we made success in that services business, we will attract more partners to work with us. And these partners will be very high-quality partners to work with.\nThierry Wuilloud: Okay. So, we might end up higher than $7 million for this year from that business?\nLawrence Tan: I will – I think we will only go growth, probably – it won’t go down.\nThierry Wuilloud: Yes. Okay. Great. That does it for me. Thank you very much. Good quarter.\nLawrence Tan: Thank you.\nKevin Vassily: Thanks Thierry.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.\nKevin Vassily: Okay. Thank you, operator. Thank you everyone for dialing in and participating on our Q1 earnings release. We look forward to speaking to you all again when Q2 rolls around. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today’s conference call. You may all disconnect."
