        "content": "Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Domo Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce to you, Peter Lowry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Peter. You may begin.\nPeter Lowry: Good afternoon. On the call today we have Josh James, our Founder and CEO; and David Jolley, our Chief Financial Officer. I’ll lead off with our Safe Harbor statement and then on to the call. Our press release was issued after the market closed and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, where this call is also being webcast. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our business under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These include, but are not limited to, statements about our future end prospects, our financial projections and cash position. Statements regarding the potential of our consumption model; statements about our sales team and technology, our expectations for new business opportunities, transactions and initiatives; statements regarding our channel of communication and upcoming events; statements regarding the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on our business; and statements regarding the impact of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business. For discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to documents we file with the SEC. In particular, today’s press release, our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. These documents contain and identify important risk factors and other information that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In addition, during today’s call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Domo’s performance. Other than revenue, unless otherwise stated, we will be discussing our results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. Please refer to the tables in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, which we have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at domoinvestors.com. With that, I’ll turn it over to Josh. Josh?\nJosh James: Thank you, Pete. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. I’ll start with our quarterly results, including some positive financial results and positive improvements in our financial position, despite a challenging macro environment. We exceeded guidance for key topline metrics in Q4, including revenue, subscription revenue and billings. We had record positive free cash flow in the quarter, and for the first time, we were operating margin positive for the full fiscal year. Importantly, we have also extended the maturity of our debt and we are bullish on closing a more economically advantageous longer term refinancing option. Now, looking ahead, of course, my top priority is getting Domo back to growth. I started Domo 14 years ago to disrupt practices that were limiting the potential of data in business. Previously, as the Co-Founder and CEO of a category-leading publicly-traded web analytics platform, I just didn’t understand why I couldn’t also access the online and offline data that all live digitally, and that I needed to answer all my questions about the business. I wondered how much more could I do if I had all the data I needed at my fingertips, on my phone, with alerts and the ability to get the whole company rallied around real-time information. In fact, how much more could all of us do with better access to data? Innovation starts with questions like these, but how often do we dismiss our curiosity just because we don’t have a way to explore it or because we’ve been beaten up for so many years with massive costs, inaccurate data, late data, siloed data or data that was only accessible through gatekeepers, and then just being told over and over and over it just wasn’t possible. That’s why at Domo we’re building AI-driven data solutions that are so intuitive that everyone can explore their ideas with AI, doing all of the work and then turning them into automated actions leading to substantial impact. Today, with the new possibilities for data and AI proactively guiding your whole experience, I see more potential for this vision than ever before. Businesses must free data from central organizations if they want to compete using AI and Domo lets our customers extend their intelligence, their expertise and governance into solutions that work for everyone. Now, when I started Domo, it was about democratizing data. Now with AI, we are democratizing intelligence, and with our broad app platform, we are even democratizing taking actions on that intelligence. I’ve spent the last year in the field as much as possible and the response to this vision is incredibly validating. I hear it time and time again, Domo is game-changing for customers who fully embrace us. That’s why this year, our strategic priorities are focused on making it quicker and easier for customers to unlock the full value of Domo. Now in turn, we expect these initiatives to improve sales cycles, drive user growth and scale our business faster. Today I’m going to focus on the progress of three key priorities. PLG or product-led growth, are rapidly growing efforts and place in the ecosystem, and democratizing AI while governing it in a very unique way for enterprises, and I’m going to explain how each will help us accelerate Domo’s growth. So I want to start with product-led growth, PLG, which contains three foundational components to how Domo operates and lubricates the entire customer adoption life cycle. First, the consumption model, which we’ve fully embraced, enables everything else. Second, a low cost and effective customer acquisition model through our freemium offering. And third, discoverability of the breadth of our platform, shown entirely in line while customers are using the product. We do this by displaying use cases, demos and data-driven pathways based on the customer’s behavior that ultimately leads them towards optimal success. Of course, this will correlate high net revenue retention and will drive ROI for both Domo and our customer. Both sides are completely aligned in a PLG model and I know every Domo sapient is excited to stand behind our ability to have our product speak for itself. Why do I know that? Because when we attend events like our upcoming Domopalooza or our 20 connection tours that we did last year, or I was definitely reminded of this just last week, over and over again, when I traveled to see customers in eight cities across the globe, that we truly have raving superfans who would love to tell us how we have changed their entire businesses. Our job now is to efficiently drive as many of these customers as possible to our product and to a new relationship with Domo. All roads lead to consumption-driven, freemium-enabled, highly discoverable, product-led growth. Now allow me a moment to share some details in each of these areas. Consumption makes it easier for Domo customers to put their data to work across the entire organization with all of their users being included being free. They can now prove value before adding to their investment and they can expand immediately without delays like lengthy contract renegotiation -- negotiations or seeking approval around IT restrictions on new users for products without budgets allocated beforehand. Now already consumption is proving its potential to open doors to new and exponential growth for Domo. I’m going to share some great examples when I talk about our wins later, but I want to start with the momentum we’re seeing as a result of this new consumption effort. Over the last two quarters, our consumption customer base has doubled, just two quarters doubled. In Q4 consumption deals accounted for over 90% of the dollar value of our new logo deals. Very significantly of our consumption customers that have already been on the consumption model for at least six months around half of them are already pacing to use more credits than what they originally contractually purchased. Now we anticipate this number will increase meaningfully as that time span increases from six months to nine months and 12 months, and we believe this will lead to many more upsell opportunities in the year. And again, our interests are aligned with our customers, they are getting more value as their credits are being consumed and we believe this is a fantastic leading indicator that we just recently discovered. These results showcase compelling indicators of future revenue growth and we are even more committed and even more poised to move the majority of our customers onto the consumption model this year. Now the second leg of the PLG stool if you will is freemium. Freemium, in fact is possible because of consumption, because of that model. We can now offer a free version of our product that lets even more users experience the power of Domo with no time limit and a natural path to becoming consumption customers as the expand usage and find value. Importantly customers do not start paying until after they are receiving value, a coupled with this freemium experience discoverability is a critical investment in our product navigation that will let us capitalize on the user growth we gained from both freemium and consumption. Today the sheer volume of data and apps we all deal with demands new and better organization. Now especially as we continue to drive more users to leverage Domo, it’s important that we offer an intuitive experience that makes it easy for users to explore Domo and to discover all the ways we help them put their data to work for their entire organization. And with this improved discoverability last fall we switched to a freemium model based on credits used from a previous free trial model that had a short and expiring timeframe and already four months later our free users who are actively connecting data about their business and exploring Domo have more than doubled, a meaningful increase in the top of the freemium funnel and we are just getting started, that’s only four months in and we believe this is an incredible signal of the PLG potential. And as we continue this momentum we’re leaning into freemium as a strategic lever for sales. Our sales teams are actively offering it to keep long lead customers engaged and to convert code called customers faster. Not only that, but with a growing pool of active users, we’re improving our sales and marketing strategies with more tailored messaging based on the user activity data that we’re gaining. We have not seen a material impact on our financials yet from these initiatives, but extrapolating these numbers out and understanding the improvements that we believe we’re going to see as we continue to refine the process. We think this is going to be a very cost-effective customer acquisition vehicle with a meaningful impact on our long-term growth. Now our next strategic priority is to make 2024 the year of the ecosystem, the year of the partner. We’ve declared it internally and we are intensely focused on scaling our ecosystem with efforts towards four different types of partners; technology partners, app partners, data partners and system integrators. Wittingly, the changes we’ve made to drive more product-led growth also align us to be effortlessly equipped for success in the ecosystem, particularly given the breadth of our end-to-end data solutions. Historically, most companies in the ecosystem considered us as competitors in one form or another. Now, we have mutually beneficial relationships where we typically drive the business of our partners by extending technologies that drive data ingestion and compute, and also by extending access to a partner’s product to a much broader base of users who were previously unreachable. I’ll give you some examples. We now work with cloud hyperscalers to run Domo while keeping compute in their own environments. That wasn’t possible before. Hyperscalers now keep that revenue and gain valuable business user growth. Domo gets more scale and also a much improved impression from the IT organization and CIOs as we are more aligned to their major current IT initiatives. Another example, technology partners can now use Domo to develop apps on our platform, combining multiple technologies automatically and out of the box, so they can provide incredibly valuable data solutions to their customers. Especially with AI being a critical component of most customer strategies, we are leading in this realm as our partners are incorporating artificial intelligence through predictive data science models and LLM-driven insights that make it intuitive for users to take action. In fact, we’re now working with a major e-commerce platform to deliver an app that will help customers keep inventory levels and geographical locations down to the box accurate. Clean inventory data provides operational benefits and will allow this e-commerce platform to deliver AI predictive analytics to its customers through the app. Lastly, on the partner and ecosystem front, Domo Everywhere is central to many data partnerships and is gaining even more momentum as many of our customers’ customers are now adopting Domo. This has also been substantially unlocked by allowing our customers and partners to offer their customers a freemium version of Domo to try out apps that they make that have pre-filled and pre-connected data from that partner. What a fantastic first freemium experience for our potential customers of Domo. Now I mentioned the hyperscalers earlier. Our fairly unique independence in the market makes our ecosystem opportunities pretty intriguing to multiple large hyperscalers. We now have budding relationships with most everyone of size in the ecosystem. In fact, in Q4 we became available in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace where customers can now purchase Domo using their Azure consumption commitment. We have numerous interesting partnership announcements and updates coming over the next few months and at our annual user conference Domopalooza later this month. Speaking of Domopalooza, the most significant advancements we will be announcing at our user conference center around our very innovative and unique investments in data-related AI technologies. I want to take a moment to preview some of our new offerings. Already Domo excels at accessing data and delivering intelligence at the right place in the right time, which positions us to be a long-term strong player in AI. It’s been said that fantastic AI eliminates the need for UI. For instance, envision a prompt that guides a business user to view their sales data or any other data and any anomalies or interesting trends. Now there are other companies who can do that, but what about doing that just for the data that has already been determined for just your access based on your job or your title or your geo. Now what if you want to deliver that insight regularly to others that are in your organization? Where’s the governance around the access and around the sharing? Where’s the data that informs the private LLM in the first place? What if you want to change from, let’s say, OpenAI to another AI service or to one of the thousands of new models available on Hugging Face and elsewhere? Then what happens to your data governance, to your access, to the data integrity? And how do you extend that to customers in data distribution apps or in automated workflow apps? There needs to be a conductor and guarantor of this governance and of this data quality and we happen to be perfectly and uniquely positioned for this. As we’ve highlighted and previewed our efforts to customers, we are receiving very encouraging responses. We’re leaning into these strengths and letting customers bring Domo’s AI into the environments where they need it. It’s a new kind of modular AI that lets customers piece together unstructured data and host governance around it with the flexibility to use any AI model they need. This foundation lets us think broadly about how we can bring AI to life and we’ll have some exciting new AI products to share soon. Now let me share some of our notable wins from the quarter, starting with several new logo customers. I’ll start with a new enterprise customer in diversified manufacturing that was looking to expand from tax to other finance use cases, including FP&A and inventory planning. The company considered using its legacy BI and ETL providers. But after a proof-of-concept with us, they chose to use Domo for a few reasons. First, after seeing the breadth of our capabilities, the company recognized Domo has a superior solution that combines both BI and ETL into a unified platform. It made Domo easier to use for them, better serving its business users and expansion was a tenth of the cost of expanding with the legacy vendors. The consumption model absolutely facilitated this deal and we’re optimistic it will continue to open doors with this customer to expand as they roll out use cases across the finance department and other departments in the future. Next example, a large healthcare company hired Domo to provide an integrated patient data network across multiple systems, a requirement for a business transition, the company that was undergoing. The consumption models helped us strategically map anticipated costs as the company scales their use cases across the organization. We won this deal against a healthcare-focused BI company because, in addition to delivering this need, we were able to solve a more horizontal business challenge and leverage the expertise of an ecosystem partner. Ecosystem for the win. Now let’s move on to another customer. We also had a significant win with a Fortune 50 healthcare company that stores sensitive materials in climate-controlled environments delivered to and stored at thousands of pharmacies. The initial use case incorporates a data reporting app, an automated workflow app and alerts to help identify and provide a data-driven action plan when the temperature ranges are outside of an acceptable boundary. The company chose Domo after a brief proof-of-concept showed how stunningly quickly we could combine data from disparate sources, including IoT devices, with our automated workflow apps to develop a superior solution to solve this problem versus a non-working 2G [ph] combination from a wide variety of the usual competitors. The customer also liked the flexibility of Domo’s platform and our fast time-to-value. We are in dialogue about a variety of additional use cases without the typical timing of giant budget conversations, RFPs and procurement approvals, thanks to our ever-enabling consumption contract. Again, good for both parties. An additional example is an industrial equipment company that chose Domo to replace their legacy vendor, which couldn’t effectively provide performance metrics, like cost of delivery and on-time performance to their hundreds of suppliers. Domo provided the enterprise-level support they needed to integrate data from multiple systems and create their supplier performance scorecards. In another example, we won business with a marketing agency that was using a homegrown analytics solution, making it difficult for business users to answer their own questions. The company chose Domo because our platform seamlessly integrates multiple marketing systems for cross-channel analytics. So customers have a single source of truth for marketing data. They also preferred Domo’s easy-to-use self-service analytics and our ability to quickly activate additional use cases. Now, those were the new logo examples, and I also wanted to share some exciting upsell examples. So with a meaningful expansion in usage in Q4, we have reached about a $1 million in ARR with another Fortune 100 global shipping and logistics customer. The company initially chose Domo because we replaced a manual process by connecting to over a dozen disparate systems to create a daily checklist of key priorities for the company’s global freight forwarding teams. Prior to Domo, the company spent hours a day assembling the checklist manually. The expansion this quarter included a variety of use cases that its incumbent providers couldn’t deliver, including a unified data experience for its customers. The company chose to expand its usage of Domo partly because of our self-service capabilities that allowed its citizen developers to solve use cases without the additional resources required by legacy solutions. In another example, we had an upsell with another Fortune 100 retailer this quarter. We already had a small footprint providing salvage and returns data, and had been looking for opportunities to expand the relationship. In Q4, we got the opportunity to connect to data sources from its hundreds of salvage vendors and provide them with real-time recovery rate metrics in a portal. A report that used to take three analysts a day to pull together is now completely automated in the Domo platform. As a result, we doubled our contract size. Consumption is unlocking a much broader audience with this customer and facilitating many discussions for additional use cases across the organization. Before closing, I want to say that I’m very excited about our aforementioned Domopalooza User Conference, which will be held in person, yay, in Salt Lake City later this month, from March 26 to March 29. We have some amazing customer stories and new data plus AI product developments to share on stage. I hope to see many of you there. As we look ahead to FY 2025, with our responsible financial posture as the backdrop, I am very excited about positioning Domo to take great advantage of our future growth potential. I feel optimistic that with the substantial transformations that we’ve made, our strategic initiatives will create meaningful momentum and let us bring the full value of Domo to customers at a much more rapid pace. I look forward to updating you about our progress throughout the year. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mr. David Jolley. David?\nDavid Jolley: Thanks, Josh. Like you, I’m excited about the growth initiatives we have laid out for FY 2025. Before I get into the details, let me provide some of the highlights for the quarter. We exceeded our billings guidance, generated record free cash flow, and for the first time, we were operating margin positive for the full fiscal year. Before I get into more details on these metrics, let me give you an update on our debt refinancing. We’ve extended the maturity of our debt with BlackRock to April 2026, a little over two years from now. Additionally, we’re currently considering options to refinance this debt on more favorable terms with a longer term facility to improve our overall financial position. While we’re still seeing a challenging macro environment, we were able to exceed the billings guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q4 billings of $105.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Total revenue was $80.2 million, also a year-over-year increase of 1%. Subscription revenue represented 90% of total revenue and grew at 2% year-over-year. In reviewing the metrics that will impact fiscal year 2025, current RPO was $243.4 million, consistent with last year and our total RPO grew 1% to $380.1 million as of January 31, 2024. On a dollar-weighted measure, we continue to have approximately two-thirds of our customers under multiyear contracts. As we had anticipated, in Q4, we had some down-sells at three enterprise customers that, combined with more normal churn, led to gross retention of 82% and net retention of 91%. Moving on to margins and profitability, our subscription gross margin was 83.9%, down 1.8 percentage points from Q4 of last year, due primarily to costs associated with new product features and functionality. We expect these costs to stabilize and our gross margin to improve slightly during fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP operating margin was 4%, up 0.6 percentage points from a year ago. Net loss was $1.9 million, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million a year ago. Net loss per share was $0.05, based on 36.8 million weighted average shares outstanding basic and diluted. In Q4, cash flow from operations was a record $5.4 million, while free cash flow was $2.9 million and our cash balance increased $3.6 million from last quarter to $60.9 million. For the full fiscal year, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $2.6 million. Now let me highlight our expectations for Q1 and fiscal 2025. In establishing our fiscal 2025 financial plan, we’ve not assumed any improvement in the IT spending environment or meaningful contribution from some of our newer growth initiatives. To be clear, we continue to be very optimistic about the longer term impact of these initiatives, including consumption, partners and freemium. We believe we could see some impact in the back half of the year, but we feel it’s prudent to see how these play out before including projected growth in our guidance. At the beginning of last year, we’d committed to be operating margin positive with positive operating cash flow, both of which we were able to achieve. Looking forward to fiscal 2025, again, we expect to have positive operating margin and leveraging what we’ve been able to achieve in Q4 our objective is also to be free cash flow positive for the full year. With that as a foundation, our plan is to invest our resources in the growth initiatives that Josh just outlined to reignite growth at Domo. While we could focus on margin expansion, we believe that consistent with the Rule of X theory promoted by Bessemer Ventures, investing in these growth initiatives will provide a higher return over time. That said, we intend to invest prudently, such that we remain operating margin and free cash flow positive for fiscal 2025. With that, we are initiating guidance for fiscal 2025 as follows. For Q1 topline metrics, we are expecting billings of about $70 million and expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $79 million to $80 million. We expect Q2 billings to be relatively flat from Q1. For the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect billings to be in the range of $324 million to $334 million and we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $315 million to $323 million. Also, as a reminder, in Q1, we are hosting our annual user conference, Domopalooza, as an in-person event for the first time in five years, which will result in higher sales and marketing expenses. We are extremely excited to be back in person for Domopalooza to share our developments in AI, product discoverability and other features with our customers. This investment always yields great returns. As a result, we expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.21 to $0.25 for Q1. This assumes 37.4 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.36 to $0.46. This assumes 38.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In addition, we expect cash flow from operations to be slightly positive in Q1. And as I mentioned, for the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect to be a free cash flow positive. In conclusion, we posted slightly better than expected topline results with record cash flow and I believe we’re setting the right foundation for sustainable long-term growth. With that, we’ll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please while we pull for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Walravens: Oh! Great. Thank you. Josh, two for you. But the first one is, what are these investments that you’re planning on making and it seems like more so in the beginning of the year than the rest of the year?\nJosh James: Well, first half of the year we have Domopalooza, so that’s a meaningful expense that’s going to hit this quarter.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Got it.\nJosh James: And then beyond that, the investments that we’re making are around building out our ecosystem and the go-to-market component of that. There’s some marketing dollars and obviously some people associated with all the opportunities that we’re seeing in the ecosystem. And then just some additional investments in AI and some SPFs and other incentives around transitioning our customers to the consumption model throughout the CSM organization and the sales organization. That’s a big part of the focus as well.\nPatrick Walravens: And when you say like investments in AI, does that basically mean hiring people with those skill sets or is it something else?\nJosh James: Yeah. Yeah. A bunch of engineers focused on -- a bunch of our best engineers focused on that and some backfills as they’ve transitioned from other areas.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Great. And then where would you say that Domo has the best product market fit today?\nJosh James: I would say there’s two components. The biggest is just an understanding of you look at that full stack, it’s really a modular full stack. And if you’re looking at your different AI opportunities that you have, how are you going to be able to take advantage of those AI services? Once you, let’s say you go into, let’s say you’re an OpenAI, you’re an enterprise OpenAI. And we had a customer just tell us this, you can upload, you can drag and drop your data files and start asking questions, but there’s zero governance around it. There’s zero ability to distribute that out. There’s zero ability to say, I want to start receiving these weekly and we have that infrastructure and that governance in place. So whether it’s extending AI intelligence or building an app and taking action off of that data that you have inside your organization, that’s where we really fit in distributing that information, governing that information and then taking action on that information.\nPatrick Walravens: All right. Awesome. And then David, a quick one for you and then a longer one for you. The quick one was, I think last quarter you told us consumption was 20% of ARR. Did I miss it? Did you give us a new number for that?\nDavid Jolley: No. I don’t think we did, but actually we’re a little over 25% at this point.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Great. Great. And then on the debt, I think you mentioned that you’re bullish about closing on more advantageous terms. Can you just give us a little more color on that, roughly -- I mean, I realize it’s hard to predict a deal, but roughly what timeframe are we talking about and what’s the risk that it doesn’t happen?\nDavid Jolley: I’ll just say broadly in process. So we’re looking at some opportunities right now, relatively kind of near-term, but looking at opportunities currently and the terms look to be, I would say, a little improved in what we have in place today.\nPatrick Walravens: All right. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Max Michaelis with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Michaelis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First one on the related to the consumption model. I know you mentioned around half of your customers on the consumption model have already, I think, approached or surpassed the contracted credits. Maybe if we look at that other half of the customers there, maybe what have you done or what are you doing to kind of drive greater usage out of that other half of the customer base on the consumption model?\nJosh James: Yeah. I think the biggest component of that and what’s interesting to us about it is, they’re only six months into it. So a lot of those are new customers and so they’re working through the installation, they’re just rolling it out to people, they’re just connecting the data for the first time. So we were surprised that already at six months, there were people that were already trending above where they had contracted with us. And it’s what we were hoping for, and frankly, what we -- why we’ve been pushing so hard consumption, because we think the long-term net revenue retention is going to be much higher than we’ve ever had here before. And then what we’re doing is, now instead of focusing on trying to go and pitch a use case to a customer and hoping that they can get budget allocation for a concept, now we’re going into our customers and saying, hey, we’re not coming in to try to get any dollars for you or get any additional contracts, but let us come and show you some use cases and you can try them out. And you can click on these buttons and it might cost you $5, but go try it out and see if you get benefit out of it. And let us show you how to use our AI services. And let us show you how to build automated workflow apps. And those kinds of conversations are much more well-received than what they’ve been historically. We’ll go to an organization that maybe has a marketing use case and they -- we have a great relationship with them, and we’ll say, hey, why don’t you introduce us to the finance team, and we’re going to show you, we’ll introduce you to the CFO at one of our other customers who’s in a similar industry as you guys and just let us share with you what that CFO is doing in their org and how they’re using Domo. And again, you already have all the users, you could do this tomorrow, you already have it in the contract, so go ahead and start using it. And so it’s more focusing on adoption and trying to help those customers consume the credits, because when they do, they’re clearly and automatically getting value from it.\nMax Michaelis: All right. Another one for me, maybe for you, Josh. So I’m not sure if I missed on the call here or in the prepared remarks, but we think about timelines, especially on AI. I know it’s early, you guys are hiring out engineers, but I mean, if we think about a timeline on when you could see the benefit from this investment in AI, what are you thinking?\nJosh James: I mean, most of our conversations that we’re having with our customers right now are around AI. All of our current customers are interested in buying additional products and services and helping them manage the various AI investments that they’re looking at. So, like we said in the prepared remarks, it used to be democratizing data and now it’s really democratizing that intelligence. And it’s -- there is -- because AI is moving so fast, when you take an AI model, you want to apply it to data, but it can’t be just a run of the store. It has to be organized. It has to be a private LLM. It has to have governance around it. You need to have the lineage around what was created, what was queried, who was it distributed to. And so you need to have a layer like Domo that allows you to understand that and govern that, manage that, distribute that. At the same time, what happens if that service that you were excited about last month is all of a sudden not very innovative and behind the times, and a brand new one comes out that is helping you, let’s say, optimize your pricing, and you want to be able to take advantage of that, and you need to switch from the old one to the new one. Now, how are you going to do that? Again, if you have a layer like Domo sitting on top of everything and that has view into the data that helps you organize and manage your data, let it sit wherever you want, let it stay in Snowflake, let it stay in Databricks, let it stay at AWS. We don’t care. We just help you manage, govern it, control it and distribute it, and that’s where we’re seeing AI really bring the strengths and advantages that we have to the forefront. So it’s actually something that we’re doing right now. We have some great product announcements coming out of Domopalooza around AI. We’ve been making investments there for quite some time. We’ve been in predictive analytics, machine learning, which are both components of what AI is today. So we’ve been doing this for a long time and it’s actually great that now the market’s moving there, it’s really highlighting the distinct advantages that we have.\nMax Michaelis: All right. Thanks, guys. And then last one for me, David, maybe for you. How should we be thinking about cash flow at the end of 2025 -- fiscal year 2025?\nDavid Jolley: Yeah. So we’re very committed to be free cash flow positive. So our plan has us achieving that, and the extent that we vary from that a little bit, we’ll take whatever actions we need to make sure that we are free cash flow positive. So that’s our plan going in here at the beginning of fiscal 2025…\nMax Michaelis: All right. Thanks, guys.\nDavid Jolley: And that’s what we expect to end up with.\nMax Michaelis: Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nCole Erskine: Great. Thanks, guys. This is Cole on for Derrick. David, one for you, maybe. Just looking at NRR [ph] down ticking again, sounds like the new investments in consumption and freemium could help that kind of run up over time. But as we think about it over the next couple of quarters, is this kind of the bottom here? Do you think that, looking at deals and potential down sales, it could go lower before it starts to accelerate?\nDavid Jolley: Yeah. I mean, as we look at the plan that we’ve got in place for this next year, I mean, this should be sort of the low point. And the way to think about it, when you look at billings and either they’re flat or growing, there’s about a there’s about a two-quarter lag on that. So if we look back a couple of quarters ago, billings were flat. We’ve had a couple of very low single-digit billings gross. But that that should start to turn and as we add to billings, again, if we see an increase in billings, then that ARR is going to go up. So and that’s what we’ve got in the plan.\nCole Erskine: Great. Thanks. And then Josh, one for you would love an update on go to market, rep productivity, pipeline into the first quarter or second quarter here? That’d be great. Thanks.\nJosh James: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we’ve definitely seen since Q4 of a year ago, the macro headwinds definitely took place in terms of rep productivity, pipeline conversion and it definitely weakened throughout the year. I think it started to stabilize in Q4. So, again, to David’s last comment, hopefully we’ve hit the trough and we have hit the divot and we’re coming back out of it, but definitely still feel macro headwinds and we’ve optimized towards the most efficient sales executives that we have. So, we know we have people that can produce and we’re doing everything we can to optimize their ability to be successful. We’ve had some successes overseas and in different pockets as well. And I think the investments that we’ve made in AI and the investments that we’ve made converting this over to consumption, we’re going to start seeing some of those things start to affect our ability to be more successful. So, not only, well, I think, the macro conditions changed things pretty dramatically and just with macro recovering alone, I think, we’d get back to the profile that we were at 24 months ago. But in addition to that, we think there’s some really cool tailwinds that we have as well with our ability to uniquely help customers out with AI and then with the change and the transformation and the model and how that affects our customers and their ability to grow with us and adapt with us and also find that return on their investment before they have to go and get a contract approved. So, we’re excited about the position. We haven’t seen it yet in the financial results, but I can say that, everybody here at the company is as excited as we’ve been about our long-term prospects. We feel like we fit really well in the ecosystem with the changes that we’ve made to our technology, and because you look at -- if you look at our unique advantages and distinct unique advantages that we have relative to the makeup of our company, we are one of the few independents and certainly at scale, that independence is helpful. We have a full stack that is composable, it’s modular and we fit really well with the hyperscalers that are out there and they’re all really interested. If you’re going to go to market and you’re a hyperscaler and you need to provide a full solution to your customer, are you going to walk in with five partners to be able to fill out that stack or maybe just with Domo? And the sales rep doesn’t have to manage five different accounts and transactions and contracts to get a deal done. They can just work with just us. And because we’ve now made our backend so that you can keep all that data driving the hyperscalers consumption, we think that it puts us in a really unique position. And we’re definitely excited to see how that plays out over the next 12 months and we’ll certainly keep the street updated on how that -- how that’s going to affect our progress and our ability to do something different than what’s in the numbers today.\nCole Erskine: Helpful guys. Thanks.\nJosh James: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. And that concludes the question-and-answer session and that also concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Domo Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Lowry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPeter Lowry: Good afternoon, and welcome. On the call today, we have Josh James, our Founder and CEO, and David Jolley, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll lead off with our safe harbor statement and then on to the call. Our press release was issued after the market close and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, where this call is also being webcast. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our business under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. These include, but are not limited to, statements about future and prospects or financial projections and cash position; statements regarding the potential of our consumption-based pricing; statements about our sales team and technology, our expectations for new business opportunities, transactions and initiatives; statements regarding our channel of communications and upcoming events; statements regarding the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on our business; and statements regarding the impact of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business. For discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to documents we file with the SEC, in particular, today's press release, our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. These documents contain and identify important risk factors and other information that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Domo's performance. Other than revenue, unless otherwise stated, we will be discussing our results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. Please refer to the tables in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, which we have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at domoinvestors.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Josh. Josh?\nJosh James: Thank you, Pete, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In Q3, we were able to exceed guidance for our key top-line metrics, including revenue, subscription revenue, and billings. A highlight in the quarter is that we had our highest operating income in history of $5 million, and our highest operating margin in history of 6%. Over the past few years, and especially the last few quarters, we have been incubating critical pivots that are finally coming together. They are clear and powerful priorities that are removing friction and strengthening our ability to deliver unmatched value to the market. Specifically, several years ago, we decided to test an idea: \"What would customers do if they had unlimited access to features for an unlimited number of users and all visualization for free?\" It was a simple value prop to customers. Pay for the value you are realizing. Well, after positive feedback we decided to run an even broader pilot last year, and the pilot proved to be a smash hit. We now feel like we've reached critical mass with over 20% of our ARR on the consumption model. As we continue to look at the results from this very large sample size, we feel very confident in making the decision and saying we're going all in on consumption. By the end of next year, we expect to have the vast majority of our revenue on the consumption model. Again, we now have over 400 customers on consumption contracts, representing over 15% of our customer base and over 20% of our ARR. When customers move to consumption, we are seeing user counts growing at almost 3 times the speed of seat-based customers. And we are seeing 3 times the adoption rate on premium features like data science. We've also rolled out reporting so our customers can see in real time what their consumption patterns are. So far, even with the highest usage our customers are seeing, the feedback has been incredibly positive because customers recognize the value of that usage. As an example, it took us eight years at a fast food chain to get an ARR of about $200,000. Now that they've converted to consumption, this company has committed to an ARR of over $550,000 over the next three years by expanding the use of Domo across the organization. One fun story to relate that has happened to me on multiple occasions over the last few months is watching how our customers react to the new model. I've seen the epiphanies go off in their eyes as they recognize and then look at people internally in the room and tell them conclusively that because they now have unlimited users, they can start looking at sunsetting all of their other BI technologies and legacy reporting tools and use Domo instead. Well, I couldn't have said it better myself. In support of our consumption strategy and to pave a completely open path to adoption, we've also launched a new freemium model. Freemium was impossible before our consumption model and gives everyone a risk-free opportunity to get in and try Domo with no obligations and no restrictions. Domo customers have access to all the Domo features with unlimited users and they can tackle any use case they want. And when they want to go bigger, they can click from within Domo to buy consumption credits and have an unlimited highway to multiply their impact on their business. This approach seamlessly aligns with our core philosophy of delivering value before requiring payment, reinforcing our commitment to providing accessible and valuable solutions to our users. We rolled out our free offering last month and will be rapidly iterating on it over the next quarter to focus on user experience and easy onboarding. We think that long term, this alters our ability to attract new customers and give them a friction-free path to move through the pipeline from free to paid usage to sharing with more users to broad use case adoption. Of course, this naturally leads to expanding credits and being ready for a long-term relationship with our sales and support organization. This new flow evolves us from having to work with cold leads to being able to talk with happy customers who already see the value of the platform and are ready to lean in more. To demonstrate the power of having a freemium model, let me share a story from two weeks ago. Our sales team had been calling a CTO prospect for over a year with no luck. One of our salespeople called the CTO on a Friday afternoon and left a message about freemium and the free credits it comes with. The CTO proceeded to sign up for a free instance, and over the weekend, multiple users connected to disparate data sources and built data flows powering over 40 reports. By Monday, the CTO was in love with the product and signed up for a three-year deal with a total contract value well into the six figures. And that was a three-day sales cycle. Our freemium product also completely changes the conversation with potential partners who have wanted to leverage our Domo Everywhere product to deliver data experiences through Domo for their own customers. In the past, if we had a customer with, say, 20,000 external end users, it would have required a major upfront investment, which often led our customer to reduce the use case to maybe just the top 5% of external customers. With freemium, however, we can give all 20,000 of those users a free instance of Domo immediately at no cost. This creates a very meaningful introduction to Domo for those end users with an obvious upgrade experience because they can experience the value and immediately expand and put more of their own data in our platform. In a consumption world, focusing on adoption through product-led growth and support programs is the critical path to success for both customers and for Domo. Increased adoption leads to happier and more successful customers, and the corollary is, of course, increased revenue. As we roll out features and training that support adoption, we've seen our customers rapidly expand their usage of our platform compared to when they were under seat-based pricing. For example, one of our largest customers had been a customer for six years. In those first six years, they had grown to 3,500 active users and 17 departments. Then, they converted to our consumption model. The growth was rapid. In just one additional year, they added 2,300 more active users and more than doubled the number of departments and use cases. This has dramatically increased the return for the customer and, of course, has strengthened our relationship in the account. In support of our shift to the consumption model, focusing on our customers' adoption of our platform brings complete alignment between us and our customers around multiplying value. It's all about opening up unlimited use cases to address a completely expanding list of customer needs. And it helps us learn more about what drives customer success. For example, which product features and functionality in our products really drive expanded usage? What of our support behaviors drive additional adoption of our products? It shifts the dynamic from trying to sell the customer more products to helping them find more ways to receive value. Now, the progress we've made with our consumption model and with our launch of freemium has dramatically altered our ability to be successful within the ecosystem and our partners. Only recently, we've changed our architecture to allow Domo to drive consumption for partners like Snowflake, AWS, and Microsoft. Before now, we've had conflict in the channel, where we sometimes drove consumption or compute away from our vendors. With the architecture changes, we now allow customers to choose to keep the data and the associated querying and processing of data with our partners. It was a substantial investment on our part, but we are very excited that this has all been reconciled. Because of these changes, we'll be making some announcements soon, describing partnerships where customers are able to retire spend by purchasing Domo through various app stores and marketplaces from major tech players. As it relates to AI, this is another area where consumption allows our customers to get in and start seeing the value of AI in their business without an upfront commitment or investment. As mentioned earlier, we've seen dramatically higher uptake in our data science offerings among our consumption customers compared to our seat-based customers, and we expect to see similar levels of adoption as we continue to expand our AI service layer and other AI offerings. The consumption model will expose many more customers to AI because they don't have to sign a contract before they start using it. This in turn, of course, drives consumption. We have several AI-related product launches lined up for the coming months that will help our customers build reports and interact with their data in a ChatGPT-like fashion. Now, to illustrate the impact of this new model that has already penetrated over 20% of our ARR, please let me share some real-life examples from some of our customers. So first, a significant new logo win with a Canadian retailer that was using competing BI solutions was having issues with silo data and with connecting to data in disparate systems. The company chose Domo for our consumption model, which made it easy for them to sunset legacy seat-based tools when they weren't sure they were getting the value that they needed. We are starting to see more and more of these cases, and it's certainly good to be the consolidator. A healthcare software company was using our Domo Everywhere solution to provide data to their medical customers. The company was adding new Domo Everywhere customers at a faster rate than expected and it was challenging under a seat-based model where they had to commit to their investment before receiving the value. Since transferring over to consumption now, our customer has tripled their contract size with us, and yes, that math works. An educational software company was debating which vendor to use for their ETL needs. They entered into an upsell contract with Domo, not only because of our ETL features, but because our consumption contract structure allowed them to predict their cost with a high level of confidence. Additionally, the company had been considering using Domo Everywhere to provide embedded analytics to thousands of their end users. Moving to a consumption model, opened the door for them to test out our Domo Everywhere experience in a very cost-effective manner. And then, because of the value they've seen in the Domo platform, this customer has committed to dramatically alter the scale of their investment and agreed to a two-year six-figure ARR contract in Q3 with a significant upsell built into the second year. Is consumption driving adoption? It certainly looks like it. Another example is a financial services company that purchased Domo to consolidate data from multiple loan origination systems. The consumption model was key to their decision to go with Domo because it unlocked our data science and sandbox features, which were critical to their use case and would have been outside their budget under our seat-based model. Does access to all of Domo help customers unlock the value of the entire platform and become more committed to the entirety of our platform? I think so. A digital customer engagement platform company has been a Domo customer for a decade. The initial use case was for sales and marketing analytics. However, about a year ago, the company was considering a cancellation because they felt like they were paying too much per seat for about 350 users. What saved the account was a move to consumption with unlimited users. Using our product, they created an app, and because they have unlimited users, they were able to deploy the app company-wide, and now have over a thousand users on Domo's platform. Not only did we save an account that was going to cancel, several months after they converted to consumption, they actually committed to an increased level of consumption and upped their spend with us. Now, would we have been able to save this customer without consumption? No. And now we have an upsell. Looking outside of Q3, here's a few more examples of how consumption is changing the game for us. A healthcare analytics company, which is using several of our larger competitors, is looking to replace some business objects and other legacy providers. Consumption is allowing the company to replace the other vendors and expand Domo without the friction of a new contract discussion. Can Domo benefit from vendor consolidation? Yes, we can. Another small highlight is a digital asset company that was about to cancel because they thought we were too expensive for the number of users they had in the account on seat-based pricing. They moved to a consumption contract with unlimited users. Additionally, they agreed to triple their contract size, and then, just last week, agreed to triple it again. So, they are now close to 10x their original size, as opposed to just recently being on the brink of canceling. Do I wish that all my customers were on consumption contracts? Yes, I do. Lastly, an insurance company that was paying us $200,000 a year moved to consumption because our seat-based model didn't allow them to expand as rapidly as they wanted to. With the initial move to consumption, they increased their contract with us by over $100,000. 15 months later, after they had been able to fully realize the value Domo can provide due to having unlimited users and functionality, they added another $200,000 annually to their contract to replace their spend with Cognos. So, in totality, I think these are some great examples of multiple customers that highlight the progress we are making as a company. Now, while we are marching toward improving the prospects of the company, we are also optimizing our costs so we can operate as efficiently as possible. To that end, we've made changes that impacts approximately 7% of our workforce, as well as reductions in contractors, marketing programs, and other expenses. We are cognizant of the effect this has on people and would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to everyone for their contributions. Now, as we look to the future, I'm sure you can feel my energy around these pivots we're making and the signals we're seeing from customers and partners that resoundingly convince us that they're the right moves. Even when we were growing 30% quarter-over-quarter -- year-over-year, I wasn't this optimistic about our future and our stability as I am now. We're quickly migrating to the consumption model. In Q4, we'll have the vast majority of our new logo customers on consumption and we will continue to encourage our existing customers to switch to consumption, resulting in the vast majority of our ARR transition to the consumption model within the next year. Freemium, our adoption programs, and our AI investments will continue to bolster our efforts in moving to consumption where customers are able to experience value and see the vision of what Domo can mean to their company before having to pay and commit to everything. All of these changes will also lead to a dramatic shift in our approach and success with partners and the broader ecosystem over the next 12 months, which should meaningfully impact our ability to generate leads efficiently. Domo is becoming a much more interesting company with prospects that excite our broader team. And with that, I'll now turn it over to David.\nDavid Jolley: Thanks, Josh. I love those examples. Like you, I'm excited about our key areas of focus and believe we're really well positioned to execute on the opportunities in front of us. Now, while we aspire to higher growth rates than we're currently experiencing, I'm pleased that we were able to exceed the billings guidance that we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Total revenue was $79.7 million, also a year-over-year increase of 1%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of our total revenue and grew... [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: One moment, everyone, while we reconnect the speaker line. Please stand by, and do not disconnect. Once again, everyone, please stand by. Once again, everyone, we are reconnecting the speaker line. Please stand by.\nDavid Jolley: All right, are we back live again?\nOperator: You are live. Please go ahead.\nDavid Jolley: All right, very good. Sorry for the short delay. But thanks, Josh. I appreciate that and appreciate those great examples. Like you, I'm excited about our key areas of focus and believe we're well positioned to execute on the opportunities in front of us. Now, while we aspire to higher growth rates than we're currently experiencing, I'm pleased that we were able to exceed the billings guidance that we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q3 billings of $74.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Total revenue was $79.7 million, also a year-over-year increase of 1%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of our total revenue and grew 3% year-over-year. And our ARR grew roughly in-line with subscription revenue growth. In reviewing the metrics that will impact the remainder of the year, our current RPO was $230.8 million, consistent with last year. And our total RPO grew 4% to $367.2 million as of October 31. On a dollar-weighted measure, we continue to have approximately two-thirds of our customers in our multi-year contracts. Our gross retention was above 85%, and net retention was about 95%. Last quarter, we identified potential renewal challenges with several large customers. And while we and some of our customers continue to face challenging IT spending environment, in Q3, these renewals discussions played out somewhat better than expected, which did help our results. In regards to the large renewal risks that we had identified last quarter, we have saved a few of them and have not identified any beyond those that we had identified in last quarter for the fourth quarter. Moving on to margins and profitability. Our subscription gross margin was 84.8%, up 0.2 percentage points from Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP operating margin was a record high 6.3%, up 5.4 percentage points from a year ago. Our net loss was very close to breakeven at $24,000, which is our best result to date, and a big improvement from a net loss of $4.4 million a year ago. Net loss per share was $0, based on 36.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In Q3, cash used in operations was approximately $4.3 million. We capitalized approximately $2 million of software costs, resulting in a decline of our cash balance of $6.5 million from last quarter to $57.4 million. Cash flow from operations in Q3 was negatively impacted by the timing of collections on some receivables. However, we're still on track to generate positive operating cash flow for FY '24, and therefore, expect our Q4 cash flow from operations to be in the range of $3 million to $4 million. Looking forward to next year, we're committed to not only being operating cash flow positive, but we are targeting free cash flow positive for FY '25. In order to bring our cost structure in alignment with this target, we recently reduced our headcount-related expense by approximately 7% and also optimize a handful of other costs. For Q4 top-line metrics, we're guiding to a billing range of $102 million to $103 million, and expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $79 million to $80 million. For the full year of fiscal '24, we expect billings to be in the range of $317.7 million to $318.7 million, and we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $317.8 million to $318.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 3%. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.05 to $0.09 for Q4. This assumes a 36.8 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.24 to $0.28. This assumes 36.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. Additionally of note is the fact that we've engaged an investment bank to assist us with refinancing and extending the maturity of our outstanding debt. And at this point in the process, we have a significant level of interest from potential lenders. In conclusion, we posted better-than-expected top-line results with record profitability and believe we're making the right moves to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yeah, congrats on the good numbers for the quarter, and I appreciate the examples regarding the capacity-based pricing impacts. I wanted to understand a little bit more on the risk of non-renewals. I think last quarter, you talked about four or five enterprise accounts that were in danger and that was part of the reset to the outlook for FY '24. Can you give us a little better color? Have we reached resolution on those four or five at-risk enterprise accounts?\nJosh James: Yes, we've reached resolution. Good news, we were actually able to keep a couple of them just with down sales, but we still kept them as customers. So that was a little bit of a bright spot when it came to the bad news. And this quarter, we've -- given the guidance, we're obviously not -- we're not on a toward pace here, but we, at the same time, feel pretty good about looking out over the next three, four quarters in terms of the pacing of where customers are that are at risk. It feels like we hit the bottom of that, and we're recovering from that. And like we mentioned, many of the examples with the consumption pricing, we actually end up on the consolidation, being the consolidator side of the equation versus having just being impacted by others. So, the move to consumption definitely changed the relationship with a lot of our customers and has helped us save a bunch of accounts. And we think especially as that plays out over the future, like we talked about, there's so many upsells that we're getting from these accounts. If you look at the cohort of customers that have been through renewal, we haven't lost any customers that have signed up to consumption. And it's a smaller sample size, 30 to 40, but as that number gets bigger, we'll keep watching that. But it certainly is extremely encouraging looking at the 20% of our business that's purely consumption and knowing that we can get that number to a vast majority just over the next 12 months.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. The other comment that you made last quarter was regarding the pipeline. And you characterized the pipeline back then as soft in all stages. I'm wondering if you could update that view on the pipeline.\nJosh James: Yeah, it feels -- as we look at the numbers, it seems like we've started to turn. There's seven, eight, nine numbers that all feel like they've barely started to turn, but it's barely. But all of our checks, it looks like things are -- hit the bottom last quarter and just are starting to slightly improve. So hopefully that's how things play out. But we're feeling like we have our arms wrapped around the situation much better and we feel like we're in a much better position in terms of the relationship that we have with our customers and our ability to sell consumption, our ability to get our customers over to consumption, training up the reps, training up the client services folks, focusing on adoption and helping people find these additional use cases. So, we feel like we're much better positioned and feel like we've got much better visibility into the customers and the contracts at this stage.\nEric Martinuzzi: Understand. Good luck in Q4.\nJosh James: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Oliver Crookenden with JMP Securities.\nPat Walravens: Actually, it's Pat, but -- Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Thank you. So, Josh, I do love the shift to consumption, and we've seen a lot of other people do it, but I was wondering if you could balance it out a little bit. I mean, there are some negatives to the consumption model, too, right? So, what do you give up when you make this shift?\nJosh James: Yeah, we -- I think if you went around the room and e-staff and tried to figure out what the negatives are, I don't -- we're not seeing any negatives. The one difference in the model is you're not going to sign up any seven-figure new logo deals, right? When you go start to use AWS, you don't walk in and be like, \"Hey, give me a couple of million bucks worth.\" You try it out and you start spending it and if you like it, you decide that you want to commit to get lower rates, and we're seeing that same thing. So, brand new seven-figure buildings walking in the door, we're not going to have as many of those. They'll happen, but they'll happen as those customers grow. So, we're seeing those relationships. We have some really big customers that are signing up right now that on the old seat model, we'd be signing up for $3 million, $4 million, but -- annually. But in the consumption model, you sign them up for $400,000 and then another $500,000, and then you get to a couple of million bucks. And you still get to the same spot. You get there more efficiently, more effectively. There's not as many -- not as much hemming and hawing. You're not going through as many use cases and approvals internally, but at the same time, you also don't have the big billings hits until they've had time to bake. So, we'll have to wait for some of those things to bake a little bit.\nPat Walravens: Okay, great.\nDavid Jolley: I think, Pat, another -- just another comment was that I think early on there was a concern, well, geez, if we're giving them whole platform, is there going to be anything to sell them later on? And there was some concern about that. But the way that's working is when we provide the whole platform and open up all the seats, it's then just about helping the customer identify how to solve more of their data issues and more use cases. And as they do that, that's the upsell. It happens very naturally.\nPat Walravens: Okay. So, there's not a near-term hit on cash flow, like you don't get less cash upfront when you go to a consumption model? I mean, maybe not...\nDavid Jolley: No. I mean still AIA...\nJosh James: subscription.\nDavid Jolley: Yeah, subscription AIA. So...\nPat Walravens: Okay. Perfect. And then, my second question is, Josh, if you could go a little deeper -- actually, I'm able to tell you my other two question, I'll put them up out front. So, for Josh, if you could go a little deeper on the architectural change and help us understand the history of that, what was it before and what is it now and how does it work? And then, maybe if you guys could address the debt in a little more detail, just sort of what's the current rate, when's the current -- when's the maturity and what's your options look like? Both of those things would be really helpful. Thank you.\nJosh James: Yeah. So, the problem before, when we were starting to get excited about the ecosystem and we were building relationships with some folks, especially the big data providers, we'd walk into accounts with reps, and then their customer that they introduced us to might start pulling some compute out of our partner and putting it into Domo. And of course, that's the end of those relationships, right? You're taking dollars out of the pockets of the reps of the partners. And so that was DOA as soon as that started. And so, what we've done now is we said, okay, we can take that compute component, where the data lives and how it gets queried and processed, and we can run that inside Snowflake or inside AWS or inside Microsoft. So, any partner that brings us in, we can keep all the computing charges and credits that are being used up actually with the partner. And so that changes the dynamic pretty meaningfully because now we have complete alignment except for instead of 40 users that you may have at -- even a big Fortune 500 company, from 40 users or 100 users to 5,000, 10,000, when you add the Domo front-end on top of that. And that's 5,000 and 10,000 people that are now querying and running reports that are all driving compute on the back-end of a Snowflake or a Databricks or a Microsoft or an AWS or Google. So, we feel like we're in a much, much better position. And that coupled with premium, there's been plenty of conversations where we're talking to a partner and someone that maybe we have 300 customers that have connected to their data. So, we know it's popular inside our network and we know that we provide a lot of visibility into the data that's inside that partner's analytics and the partner will come to us and say, \"Gosh, it'd be great if we could give this to the other 10,000 customers that we have.\" And then we say, \"Yeah, great. You should do that. It's, let's see, $840,000.\" And the partners like, \"What? Well, we don't know the values yet.\" We're like, \"Yeah. But we will give you upside if they converted to the Domo customers.\" They're like, \"Yeah, that seems like a good idea on paper, but I don't know if we can lean in and make the commitment, make the investment without seeing a return. So, maybe we should just try it out with a couple of customers.\" And by then, you've lost momentum. Whereas now, we can go in that same customer, that same conversation, we say, \"Yes, we can get it to all 10,000. Let's do it on freemium. Let's build some quick start guides so that the second you roll this out, the customer is able to log into Domo, see all of the data from you as a partner. We'll build out the dashboards. We'll build out the alerts.\" They're going to get this great white-glove, perfect experience replicated 10,000 times automatically. And in there, they can see, \"Hey, this is your Domo experience for this data from your partner. If you want it for everything else, here's your freemium account, just keep going.\" And then, we tell the partner, \"Any upside, we're going to give you guys a piece of it.\" So all of a sudden, providing data to their customers becomes not a cost center, it becomes a profit center. And we've seen a bunch of traction in just even the last month for that. So, we're really excited about our ability to provide Domo Everywhere through our freemium offering.\nPat Walravens: Great. And then, Dave, on the debt?\nDavid Jolley: Yeah. So, our current debt, as you might recall, we raised that debt even prior to our IPO when we were still using a lot -- consuming a lot of cash. And so, it's very expensive debt. It carries a cash interest component and a PIK interest component, some other payments that push the effective interest rate north of 14% is where we're at today. And it's got a maturity of April '25. And so, we've gone out with a refinancing and got a bank helping us, and we're looking at cash interest component of a little over 11% right now based on where SOFR is at. We're hearing some good things about where rates might go next year, but it'll bring our rate down substantially and push our maturity date out to '29 or '30. So, it sort of puts it out well out into the future and it eliminates some of the other PIK interest and some of the other elements.\nPat Walravens: All right, terrific. Thanks to both of you.\nOperator: One moment everyone, the speaker line has disconnected. One moment we reestablish the audio. Once again, everyone, please stand by. We'll establish that audio line momentarily. Please stay on the line. Once again everyone, you are on hold for the Domo, Inc. conference call. We are establishing the speaker line. Please stand by. You are now live.\nJosh James: All right. Sounds like Pat said thanks, we heard, and there was another question. Is the question still on?\nOperator: Yes. One moment. We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood with T.D. Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks. This is Cole on for Derek. On the RIF that you talked about, we'd just like to get a little bit more color. Is that across sales, G&A? If you can just unpack that a bit, that'd be helpful.\nJosh James: Yeah, we -- it was across every department. There was -- the majority of it was in sales. We're in terms of growth, not where we want to be. And so for the most part, it was based on performance. Some of it was just positions that were eliminated, as we found a more optimized way of accomplishing certain things. It wasn't a huge number, but it was still several dozen humans that were affected. So, a little bit of a rough day here at the office, but at the same time, I feel like the company is in a better position. And it's not a dramatic effect on our ability to produce. We think in many cases, actually, taking a smaller number of leads distributed -- I mean, taking the same number of leads distributed to a smaller number of reps will actually be an improvement for the reps that are here to make sure that they're being fed. So, overall, I don't think it's going to be too impactful to our company. It just, obviously, impacts the folks that were affected by it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sounds good. Helpful. Just building on that too, for the reps that you still have at Domo, how is productivity trending? Any new initiatives around helping them sell consumption better would be helpful to hear about things.\nJosh James: Yeah, we have all kinds of initiatives around helping them to consumption. We had a Board meeting just recently and walked through our consumption deck and showed the Board members all the positive things that are happening and all the negative things that we might be able to find as well. And the resounding answer was -- from the Board was, \"Move as fast as you possibly can. We don't see anything that would cause us concern about you moving as fast as you possibly can.\" So, to that end, doing as many things as we can to drive the transition to consumption, things like we've built out a brand new adoption group that's focused on going into our -- especially our bigger customers, and helping them, it's a great phone call. We call a customer, and we're not asking for a new contract. We're not asking to go get approval from procurement. We're just walking in saying, \"Hey, we'd love to come in and show you best uses for data science,\" or \"We'd love to come in and talk to you about identifying opportunities inside your marketing spend.\" And they love those conversations. All we're doing is walking in and helping them, but we're helping them identify additional use cases, which, of course, ends up driving consumption. So those are the types of things that we're doing with the customer. And then, we're re-evaluating the different departments that we have and what each group does. So, reps, their job on renewal. What's what is the job on renewal? Is the job to go and procure another contract, or is the job to help identify some more use cases? And so, just identifying those different ways that we can interact with our customers to help get them excited about adding additional users and adding additional use cases. It's really fun for the customer, and it's really fun for us. They end up happier. They end up spending more. And those are the types of things that we can really do to address transitions to consumption. There are some customers that are on seat-based licenses with us, and they don't have access to all the features. We have new features rolling out all the time, and if you want to use those features, then you need to be on consumption. And so, as we go out and market the different product offerings that we have and the new product offerings that we have, those all lead to additional consumption conversation. So, we're definitely laser-focused on that. We've seen this 20% cohort of consumption that's in our business today. And it looks better than every other 20% cohort that you could find. So, we're going to do anything and everything we can to get the entire business moved over to that because just everyone ends up happier on the consumption model.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nJosh James: Yeah, you bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Yeah, thank you for squeezing me in. And sorry, I've been toggling between multiple calls, so if I'm repeating a question, I apologize upfront. But David, just given the -- sort of the refinancing of the debt and sort of the higher rate environment and given the sort of actions you guys are doing today on cost, to what extent could debt pay down be part of like the capital allocation strategy, given that the budget environment is still pretty constrained right now? How do you look at debt pay down a potential lever for increasing sort of the equity value?\nDavid Jolley: Yeah. I mean the good thing is even sort of as is with a very modest growth expectation for next year, I think we're free cash flow positive, which puts us in a great position. So, if we're able to accomplish some of the things that Josh talked about in accelerating our shift to consumption, and if we get any sort of help from the macro environment, then we're into producing some meaningful cash flow that then could be used to potentially retire some debt. As you know, there's usually some penalties when you pay it down in the first year. So, we'll look at that. But I think it'll be -- probably will be a lot better position as we move into some of those succeeding years to start reducing that well in advance of maturity, certainly.\nSanjit Singh: Great. I appreciate the thoughts. And then, Josh, on -- I was just kind of coming out of the AWS conference, and when I hear about people's data strategies, one of the bigger themes is sort of English being the new programming language and English being the new SQL. And just want to get a sense of how you guys are sort of abstracting away kind of traditional BI type user interfaces to more of that generative AI modality where users are just sort of using natural language, English, to get the insights that they need from Domo?\nJosh James: Yeah, I mean it's terribly exciting because one of the most challenging things in business intelligence or in leveraging the data that you have in your company is just getting access to it. And the big part of getting access to it is connecting to it, all of the ETL that needs to go into it. And you're right, that's where these antiquated languages used to be a big part of it. And going forward, it is about English. And we have a bunch of stuff that we've already incorporated into our products, a bunch of AI that we've incorporated into our product, and a bunch of generative AI that we're going to be incorporating over the next few months into exploring the data, into building cards, into sharing data, having a data set and having AI suggest to you what you should look at, what format it should look like, being able to pick and choose from things that it suggests to you, fully formed reports. And so, it's going to dramatically alter the landscape. It's going to dramatically alter the interactions and the benefits that the customers get. So, we're really excited about that. We feel like we're extremely well positioned. When you look at the data that powers AI, it all depends on how organized that data is. And if your data is organized like a bunch of trash, then that's exactly what you're going to get back. When you use Domo, you actually not only organize your data, but you have a bunch of metadata about that data. And that's what helps AI really come up with great conclusions when it actually has an indication of what type of data is sitting there because in the data world it could be anything. It could be unstructured, messy data, and it might be data that's coming from another data warehouse. You actually don't know the root source of it, and so you need to be able to have the metadata around that and have data organized in a way. And that's one of the things that we really do with our customers, is help them organize that so that they can take advantage of all the different technologies and innovations that are rapidly coming out from AI. So, we feel like we're extremely well positioned for that. And that's another big part of why we want to be in the middle of consumption, because again, if you're using consumption, anything that is in our product, you can try out. It's going to cost you a buck to try it out. It's not a $50,000 commitment and you've got to buy a couple seats. It's just go and click on it, see what it does, see if it produces something that's effective. And then, if it does, of course, you're going to start using it more. And because you already know it's effective, even though you're using it more, you're getting a bill for it, you don't care because you already proved the value. So that's just another reason why consumption is such an important part of this, where we see 2x, 3x usage of the additional features and functionality we have in our product when it's a consumption customer, because they're able to try it out and prove that it works. So, we're really excited about AI and the way it's going to impact our business, broadly speaking, and feel like we're really well positioned to take advantage of that.\nSanjit Singh: Appreciate the thoughts, Josh. Thank you.\nJosh James: You bet. Thanks.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation today, and you may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Domo Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Peter Lowry, Domo Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nPeter Lowry: Good afternoon, and welcome. On the call today, we have Josh James, our Founder and CEO; and David Jolley, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll lead off with our safe harbor statement and then onto the call. Our press release was issued after the market close and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, where this call is also being webcast. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our business under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These include, but are not limited to, statements about future and prospects or financial projections and cash position; statements regarding the potential of our consumption-based pricing; statements about our sales team and technology; our expectations for new business opportunities, transactions and initiatives; statements regarding our channel of communication and upcoming events; statements regarding the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on our business; and statements regarding the impact of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to documents we file with the SEC, in particular, today's press release, our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. These documents contain and identify important risk factors and other information that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Domo's performance. Other than revenue, unless otherwise stated, we will be discussing the results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. Please refer to the tables in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which we have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at domoinvestors.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Josh. Josh?\nJosh James: Thank you, Pete, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. In Q2, even in the tough macroeconomic environment, our year-over-year total revenue growth was still at 5%. Our subscription revenue growth was 6%, and billings declined 2%. Our results for Q2 were in line or better than our guidance, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made in the past few quarters, particularly with our consumption-based pricing, our AI strategy offerings and road map and our sales force retention. That being said, I expect our return to growth may take longer than we would all have hoped for due to some macro headwinds that seem to be affecting most companies we're familiar with. Let me give you an update on some of the progress we've made and what gives me confidence in our longer-term growth prospects. First, I'm confident that we have the people and technology to get back to the growth we've experienced in the past and to do so responsibly by managing our costs. I continue to spend my time on the road with our current and our prospective customers, and the conversations I'm having in the market are reinforced by optimism. We hear time and time again that Domo can solve complex data problems that our competitors simply can't, and we do it in record time. Many of these promising interactions are happening through our customer Connections Tour, where we've gained some candid insight into why organizations choose Domo over leading competition. One customer from a large publicly traded advertising group expressed that Domo offers superior speed and computing power and significantly reduces the effort to create reports, train their data specialists to focus on higher-value business deliverables. I believe there is potential for conversations like this to translate into significant transactions for Domo in the near to midterm that could drive upside to our guidance. Second, I believe our increased focus on consumption-based pricing can be a growth driver and create stronger relationships with our customers as we've removed the limitation on number of seats in an account by granting access to all employees of a customer and only charging for data usage similar to Snowflake, AWS and others. Because we can charge for usage while offering seat licenses and visualization for free, consumption pricing solves many of our historic barriers to adoption and more directly aligns our pricing to the value realized by our customers. Thanks to this, consumption pricing is opening more doors for upsell opportunities. One of the very encouraging trends we see with our consumption customers is an increase across key metrics, including data flows and connector runs, which represent a significant source of potential growth. Over the past year, we have seen almost a 30% increase in contract size for new logos going on consumption-based pricing compared to new logo customers going on seat-based pricing. Also, for customers renewing who have converted to consumption pricing from seat-based pricing, we are seeing almost a 60% increase in the number of user accounts created and somewhat surprisingly, a higher log-in rate of the total users on the consumption model versus the seat-based pricing model. We're also seeing momentum in increasing the percentage of new logo customers who choose consumption pricing. 50% of our new logos in Q2 were priced on a consumption basis. That's up from about 30% of our logos -- of our new logos in Q1, and we are targeting 75% this quarter in Q3 and even higher in Q4, setting us up well to have a substantial impact on the way we go to market and even convert renewing customers to the consumption model aggressively next year. We have over 250 customers on our consumption pricing model as of July 31, which represents over 10% of our customer base and over 13% of our ARR. Another benefit to Domo is that our consumption pricing contracts are structured as subscription contracts. This means the revenue is recognized ratably, mitigating some of the lack of predictability associated with pure consumption-based models. Beyond these direct benefits for Domo and our customers, our consumption pricing is also expected to improve our competitive positioning. Some customers see our competitors' visualization offerings as essentially free because their visualization tool is included as part of an enterprise license agreement. We think including visualization with the free seats under our consumption model is a compelling selling point for enterprise and corporate customers and prospects and positions us better against some of our competitors. Another positive in the quarter was that we once again had much lower-than-forecasted attrition in the sales force. Year-to-date, we have stemmed the sales force attrition we saw last year when 30% of the sales team churned. Next, I continue to be excited about the potential for AI to be a growth driver for Domo. I believe we are strongly positioned to be a leader in delivering AI-powered data experiences, in governing those data experiences and in enabling businesses to achieve the data readiness required to capitalize on the broader possibilities of AI. Domo gives you the ability to apply the power of AI to your business now. For capacity planning, if a company needs to know the number and type and timing of employees they need to hire to achieve a business goal, they can do that right now. If a company wants to run simulations to dynamically price and bundle their offerings, they can apply AI to that problem in Domo now. If a lender wants to perform a risk assessment model on patterns of behavior and other factors, they can use AI to apply that to the data they have in Domo right now. This month, we announced progress showcasing our commitment to this ongoing ambition, including mobilizing the full force of Domo's AI technology, expertise and vision as Domo.AI. Data and technology are important foundations, but real transformation comes from making them useful and reliable in the hands of many. Domo.AI is championing a future where AI-powered data experiences truly transform business by amplifying a very powerful asset, human curiosity. The hurdle I think many businesses will need to overcome is building in the safety and efficiency required to effectively democratize AI. That's why Domo's approach goes beyond wiring OpenAI to the end user experience. It's about embedding AI responsibly into the very fabric of the entire business. Let me tell you about some of the ways we're making this possible through Domo.AI. Our suite of AI tools empowers users with chat-style data exploration and provides flexible model creation, efficient model management, seamless deployment and superior governance and security. Domo's AI service layer lets businesses capitalize on the power of AI without getting bogged down by its complexities. Users can easily manage, deploy and optimize any AI model they choose right in our data experience platform to support real-world use cases that matter to everyone. AI is now easily accessible in Domo Bricks, Domo's app dev framework, and in Workflows. Even low-code tools such as Magic ETL are designed to tap into AI model management, making the power of AI accessible even to those without technical expertise. All of this and more is featured in our newly launched Domo.AI website, where we'll continue to share our progress in creating a new future for data and AI. We're also excited to be hosting our first ever innovation summit focused on AI this month, a free online event that will highlight just how Domo.AI solutions are already helping businesses overcome real-world challenges to accelerate innovation and growth. AI is only as powerful as the data connected to it. We have a well-connected end-to-end data stack, opening up many possibilities for Domo to reimagine what data can do for business. I encourage all of our investors to follow Domo's AI journey, starting with visiting the website and attending our virtual innovation summit on August 29 in North America and EMEA and August 31 in Asia Pacific, where almost 3,000 people have already registered. While we're optimistic about these significant long-term growth drivers, the IT spending environment remains challenging. Enterprises are carefully scrutinizing vendors, and many are consolidating their spend among fewer vendors. We're seeing sales cycles elongate, and even satisfied customers are being asked by their IT and finance departments to evaluate their spend upon renewal. David will go into more detail, but we're also evaluating our renewals on a granular basis. And while each one is unique, we do see some risk to some of the larger renewals, which we have incorporated into our guidance for the second half of the year. We would not expect to see some of these discussions in a more normal spending environment or in an environment where these customers were already in a consumption model. And then on the new business front, as an indication that this is purely macro driven, we saw conversion rates fall across each stage of the funnel, which is further evidence of the challenging IT spend environment that we're facing. However, we continue to find opportunities to deliver significant value to our customers, and we do have several notable wins to share from the quarter. We closed a very significant upsell with a Fortune 500 U.S. financial institution to provide a custom app for wealth management operations powered by our data platform. Domo stood out for automating previously manual, time-consuming workflows and offering custom smart content that is specific to each employee across thousands of employees. Ultimately, the customer chose Domo because our platform provided a complete elegant solution to a business challenge at scale. Another example, we worked with a nonprofit subsidiary of a high-profile private university and we drove a significant upsell to support their digital corporate learning solutions. This customer rolled out the entire Domo data experience platform to 600 new users after successfully improving learning experiences, thanks to real-time insights into course interactions. This win is a strong endorsement of our impact and a great example of how our consumption-based pricing model is opening doors to grow existing business. We also won a significant new logo with a global health care leader that chose Domo to provide a unified view of their marketing performance. We are in this business after a successful proof-of-concept trial to improve marketing performance across multiple brands and countries. In addition to the fantastic customer wins, we also continued to create movement within our industry. This quarter, Domo was ranked the number one self-service business intelligence vendor by Dresner Advisory Services. Domo was also recognized as an overall leader in Dresner's 2023 Wisdom of Crowds study, which included our perfect recommendation score for the seventh consecutive year. Among our best-in-class categories were integrations with third-party technologies, our ease of installation and our ease of administration, all of which showcase our readiness to help businesses seize the imminent opportunities for data. In addition to this outstanding recognition, Domo was also included on two Constellation ShortLists, which are published to help organizations search for technologies to meet their digital transformation goals. Domo's placement on two ShortLists, the list for multi-cloud analytics and BI platforms and the list for embedded analytics, is a strong endorsement for our reputation of driving customer success. I'm also proud to share that Domo was once again named to the Parity.Org list of Best Companies for Women to Advance. This marks our fourth consecutive year of being recognized for our commitment to support women through career advancing opportunities. We believe that diversity makes organizations stronger and view our continued progress in this commitment as a factor in Domo's future success. In closing, while there are certainly some near-term challenges driven by the macro and current IT spending environment, I'm as confident as ever in our team, our technology and our long-term growth opportunity. And with that, I'll turn it over to David.\nDavid Jolley: Thanks, Josh. In Q2, we posted 6% subscription revenue growth and 5% total revenue growth. We exceeded the billings guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter and delivered Q2 billings of $70.6 million, a year-over-year decrease of 2%. In reviewing the metrics that will impact the remainder of the year, current RPO was $232.1 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year, and our total RPO grew 2% to $357.6 million as of July 31, 2023. Our ARR grew in line with subscription revenue growth. An area where we saw continued success was multiyear contracts. On a dollar-weighted measure, we now have 67% of our customers under multiyear contracts at the end of Q2, up from 64% a year ago. Our gross retention improved from Q1, was just under 90%, while our net retention was just below 100%, down from Q1. Our net retention was driven by a challenging upsell environment, which I'll talk about in a moment. Q2 total revenue was $79.7 million, a year-over-year increase of 5%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of total revenue and grew 6% year-over-year. International revenue in the quarter represented 21% of total revenue, down slightly from Q2 of last year. Our subscription gross margin was 84.9%, down 0.4 percentage points from Q2 of last year and down 1.1 percentage points from Q1, primarily due to our move from a fully depreciated data center. We would expect to remain in this range in the near-term. I'm also pleased that in Q2, our non-GAAP operating margin was positive 5.7%, up 12.2 percentage points from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating margin primarily excludes stock-based compensation as well as executive severance, which was related to the transition of C-level executives. Our net loss was about $800,000, an improvement from $8.2 million a year ago, and our net loss per share was $0.02. This is based on 35.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In Q2, cash provided by operations was approximately $600,000. In total, our cash balance declined $2.1 million from last quarter to $63.9 million. We expect Q3 cash from operations to be near breakeven, and we continue to expect full-year fiscal '24 cash from operations to be positive. We believe we've got adequate cash in order to continue to pursue our business objectives. In terms of guidance, let me share some thoughts. As Josh mentioned, the IT spending environment has been challenging for us, similar to some others in our sector. There are two factors I'd like to highlight. First, while our sales rep attrition has been less than forecast in Q1 and Q2 and we continue to build our sales capacity, our conversion rates, new leads and resulting new business have also been less than forecast. Part of what we're seeing is a sense of caution even greater than six months ago across the board with customers looking carefully at their software spend. While we believe we have a superior technology, some customers and prospects are already paying for another solution as a part of a broader enterprise-wide license agreement where their BI tool can be perceived as incrementally free, and they may be already using that BI tool for a big portion of their organization, leading some customers and prospects to consolidate their spend on these solutions. As Josh mentioned, I think our consumption-based pricing helps our positioning against this specific challenge. The second factor is that ongoing uncertainties about the macroeconomic environment are presenting challenges with renewals with some large customers. Oftentimes, this is due to the conflicting objectives of business use cases versus the overall IT spending mandates. Based on what we're seeing, we believe our return to growth will take longer than originally anticipated. And as a result, we've lowered our new business and gross retention forecast for the remainder of the year. To put this in context, for the entire fiscal '24, our reforecast has resulted in a downward adjustment of about 7.5% in billings and 2.5% in revenue. For Q3, we're guiding to billings of $72 million to $73 million, down 2% year-over-year. For full-year billings, we're providing a range of $313.5 million to $321.5 million, representing a year-over-year decline of 1% to 3%. Now to guidance for our GAAP metrics. For the third quarter of fiscal '24, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $78.5 million to $79.5 million. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, of $0.10 to $0.14 for Q3. This assumes 36.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. For the full-year of fiscal '24, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $316 million to $320 million, representing year-over-year growth of 2% to 4%. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted of $0.39 to $0.47. This assumes 36.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. Our EPS guidance implies a positive operating margin for the full-year. In summary, in spite of the challenges we've discussed, we are committed to remain operating margin positive for the year and near cash flow breakeven through the second half of the year. And I'm confident we've got the right people and technology to execute against our market opportunity. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Okay, thank you. Yes, it sounds like a challenging environment out there. And I'm just wanting to kind of parse out the macro versus potentially internal changes that you guys have made. And really, one of the big initiatives for you guys was to go after this consumption-based pricing model. And it sounds like you've had good success and conversion when, I guess, succeeding at that. But has that been a factor in leading to longer sales cycles, more investor education? Just trying to get a sense for how much is external versus how much is internal because on the macro front, it generally feels like things haven't changed a whole lot in the last six months, but it sounds like you guys have seen some more change.\nJosh James: Yes. We've definitely seen more change from our customers. Like we said, our conversion rates have dropped quite a bit over those six months. And we've -- from a consumption standpoint, that's actually been a great tailwind. So our sales cycle is not-longer from consumption. They're pretty similar. In fact, they're a little bit better when we do consumption deals. Our upsells are faster when we do consumption deals. So the repeat business comes in a little bit quicker. Our deal sizes are bigger when we do consumption deals. And like we mentioned, 50% of our deals this last quarter were consumption deals of the new logos, and we're shooting for 75% this quarter, and that's with only still a portion of the teams trained. So we think by the end of the year, we can get that up in the 90s. And the other thing that's great about consumption, so it's -- they're bigger deals, happier customers, higher retention and quicker upsells. And then I think most importantly, there's two components. Number one, we have a much bigger footprint inside those organizations. So instead of having a customer that's got us in one room and the competitor in the next room, it gives an ability to get more users since we don't charge based on users. So we have seen literally a 60% increase in the number of users that we get when customers convert over to our consumption model. So they had x number of users. And then after they move to consumption, they have 60% higher. So that's been great. And then not only that, they're actually logging in more frequently as well. So they're becoming -- they get adopted by the whole organization. So that's one piece that's really exciting. And then the other piece is just the opportunity to wake up the first of the year and know that you've got growth in your accounts, that you don't have to go in and upsell. It's just consumption. And we're seeing good growth from a consumption standpoint. It's still early to talk about exactly what kind of uptick we're going to see in those consumption deals, and we need to go through a couple more quarters of that, but we're very sure that there is an uptick from consumption. And as we work with customers and go through a big chunk of renewals, then we'll understand exactly what that number is.\nDerrick Wood: Okay. I guess that is the silver lining. It sounds like on the other side, there's -- you're seeing some headwinds from vendor consolidation. And I'm just wondering if you can piece that out because you guys beat your Q2 number, but there's a pretty big guide down for second half, and you're alluding to some tougher renewals. Can you -- is that more in the enterprise side where you potentially are seeing more contract losses? Or is it corporate? And is it concentrated? Is it more prevalent? And what's informing you on that potential risk in the second half? Just if you could give more color, that would be great.\nJosh James: Yes. It's with some of our enterprise customers that -- we're really seeing some pretty good stability there better than with corporate, in fact. But enterprise customers are more susceptible to having multiple vendors in there. So when you look at vendor consolidation, which is definitely a theme, I think, across the broader IT industry, our enterprise business is more susceptible to that for sure. So thankfully, over the last five years, we've been working on this consumption model, and we're really excited about what that's going to do for the business. With the enterprises in particular -- because what we'll see is we'll go into an account, they'll switch over to consumption, and what was happening to us before is now happening to the other vendors. And what I mean by that is our customers will come to us and say, yes, there's these other four projects that we have. And now since we're not paying you for seats, I guess, we could go eliminate this other vendor where we have this data project that we're doing, and we can go eliminate vendor B where we have this small project in this other division. And then vendor C, we'll kind of have to see how that plays out with you guys. So that's been a huge boon to us and our relationships with our big enterprise customers. But there's a handful where that happened to us or we think it may happen to us and just the idea that it might force us to say we got to be conservative here in our guidance as we get that new information. I think that, in conjunction with just seeing, yes, we have more sales capacity, but the conversion rates being down in the process through the pipeline forces you to look and say, do you want to spend that incremental marketing dollars to feed the sales team. And it doesn't seem like that's the right way to go because we want to make sure that we're staying really fiscally sound, staying cash flow positive and staying net operating margin positive. And we can do that with this great, I think, awesome transition that's going to happen in our business as we move more and more to consumption. And as we're able to take advantage of things like freemium because we now have a consumption model, and we'll be seeing that over the next quarter as well.\nDerrick Wood: Okay. And just one for David. I mean, how low can that revenue retention rate go in the second-half? And I guess to Josh's point about staying breakeven, do you need to make any kind of OpEx cuts or head count cuts? Or how are you feeling about the initiatives for second-half around OpEx spend?\nDavid Jolley: Yes. I think to that point, specifically, we've sat down, take a look -- taken a look at the business for the second half to say, okay, if we don't produce the same number of billings that we originally forecast and we don't have that cash as a result, how do we manage that? And we're confident that we can bring down costs in areas that aren't going to affect our ability to go out and compete effectively in the market and win in the market.\nJosh James: A lot of it was incremental spend that we were -- that we had originally forecast. And so we just take the incremental spend out. You don't hire a bunch of new folks. You're really careful with your spend on outside consultants. And I think that's where the -- cost savings that we needed. And we found some efficiencies. I mean really since we got here, we've been finding efficiencies. And with those efficiencies that we've already found, we feel really good about our ability to hit the margin number.\nDerrick Wood: Okay, alright. Thank you.\nDavid Jolley: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nPatrick Walravens: Oh, great. Thank you. So I guess, first of all, with respect to the large renewals in H2, have some of those large renewals already informed you of their intention not to renew?\nJosh James: No, we've got -- I mean, there's certainly a couple of them that we know about, and that's why the guide is where the guide is. And then there's others that we just -- we're seeing a low renewal rate with the vendor consolidation. So as we get further into conversations, just trying to figure out what's the right percentage to apply to that as we're doing our forecast. And that's where we came up with -- what we came up with.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. And then I mean, if you look at those large renewals and take them as a whole, I mean, just rough ballpark, what percentage of the business are we talking about? 1%, 5%, 10%?\nJosh James: If you go look at our top 50 customers, there's only a handful. It's only five, six customers that you're worried about, and you have great relationships with the rest of them. And we have great relationships with the four or five that we're worried about, but the four or five that we're worried about -- we know there's other vendors in there. We know that they're talking about vendor consolidation. We know that they're beating us up on price, that they're negotiating. And so again, just trying to hedge the right amount and make sure that we're being conservative enough. So it doesn't feel like -- it definitely doesn't feel like a holistic, we got to be worried about the enterprise business at all. In fact, I'd say it's just -- there's a handful of deals. There's still one deal in there that's COVID related that we're definitely worried about. And that's on the list. That's one of the four or five. So it doesn't feel like it's some kind of systemic problem that we have. It's just a handful of deals that are dealing with their IT consolidation and these big enterprises. The CIO -- there's one CIO we talked to, and he said to me that he had a several billion dollar IT spend and that when the CEO called him, he said, hey, you have several billion dollars of IT spend. I want $1 billion out. So those are the marching orders. And that's the only conversation we've had thus far, but we know that, that means, hey, we got to be really careful here about forecasting that renewal.\nDavid Jolley: And I think just from a -- just one thing I might add to that from a defensive standpoint, when we're sitting in 300 or 400 seats in that account, and we know that our competitors are virtually enterprise-wide, it just really drives home the point that we need to be in a similar position defensively. And as we move to a consumption model, that allows us to be in that same position where we've got seats across the entire enterprise. So that really kind of pushes us to accelerate the move to consumption and try to get all of our accounts over there.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Great. And so Josh, I always ask you under what circumstances this business might be sold, and the way the shares work in Domo, it's basically your decision. So does this consolidation trend impact how you think about that?\nJosh James: I mean I think about that the same way always. It just depends on if anybody ever brought us an offer and then we would take a look at it and evaluate that relative to the opportunity we have in the marketplace and relative to what we think the long-term value of the shares should be. And right now, I'd say, despite some of the short-term headwinds that I think most people are dealing with, there's certainly a few exceptions as you read everybody's earnings calls. But most people are dealing with a lot of these similar things. Despite that, like we tried to indicate on the call, we're actually pretty excited about the future. We're really excited about the people that we have here. And we're really excited about the opportunity where we're sitting. We talked a lot about AI. I mean when ChatGPT starts getting exciting and everyone is talking about it and you want to have prompts to enable instead of using Beast Mode or using SQL, you can do it in ChatGPT. That's cool. It's really interesting. It's exciting, and we're definitely excited about that. But the fact that you can take any BI -- any AI model that's out there and you can automate the whole process inside Domo, you can apply any particular model that's sitting out there in Hugging Face, and you want to get a bunch of data that you have in your business and you want to apply those models to that dataset, how do you do that? Well, we happen to have the first mile done. And then we can allow you to do the second -- to take that model and apply that AI power to your business right now. And then we have the last mile. You want to move the benefit out of that and distribute that out to people in your organization. You want to have that continue to automatically work inside your organization with updated data as it comes through. We're one of the few places you can do that. So we're really excited about that as well.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Last one, I'm sorry, it goes along. So what steps do you think you guys can take to help build back shareholder value until we get through this tough macro and until we get through this consumption shift?\nJosh James: Yes. I mean I think the consumption shift is not -- there's nothing negative about that in our business. So I don't think that's any -- in fact, that's just positive. It's positive as we go through it. It's positive every step of the way. We don't have to wait for the benefit. We're getting the benefit -- every time we incrementally improve that, we're getting a benefit. And I think the other thing that's really important in this kind of an environment is that you make sure that you're not burning cash, you make sure that you have a positive operating margin. And I think we're being really judicious about that. We have a lot of levers that we can still pull that we don't need to pull yet, and hopefully, we don't have to. And so I think you just continue to hang around the hoop, keep the capacity there and keep building great products, and we feel really good about our prospects on that front.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay, thank you.\nJosh James: Yes. You bet. Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Going back to the topic of consumption. I was wondering, with the 10% of the base that has moved on to consumption, has there been -- is there any sort of accounting rev rec headwind that's associated with it? So if you're bringing a customer on via subscription versus consumption, is there any sort of rev rec differences that we should be aware of that could also be a headwind to revenue? I know you said deal sizes are bigger with consumption. So does it sounds like on a TCV basis that there's any impact there? But just wanted to kind of check if there was any headwinds as customers move from -- come on board via consumption versus subscription.\nDavid Jolley: Yes. Thanks for that question. It's an important observation. So the way that we have structured our contracts and then the way that we have structured our consumption model, that still allows us to have ratable revenue recognition, so providing the same level of predictability that we've got today. We've spent a lot of times working -- a lot of time working together with our outside accountants to make sure that our contracts are structured in a way that will allow us to retain that. And so we don't really see anything on the near-term or even medium-term horizon that would cause that to change, unless the rev rec rules change somehow. But we're pretty comfortable with the way we've structured it and the resulting ratable recognition.\nSanjit Singh: Great. And Josh, I've covered a couple of companies who have gone through a transition to consumption. And some of the things that have come up in the past is around the customer incentive to move to consumption. And I get the idea that there's no shelfware and things like that. But when you talk about deal sizes being larger in consumption versus subscription, like what's sort of in it for the customer? Because in the sense, they still outlay more dollars to work. And I get the removal of the seat-based friction. But like what's in it for the customer to make that initial conversion, particularly the existing customer base, from subscription to consumption?\nJosh James: Yes. It's a great question. I think the first thing is, again, there's lots of projects internally that they're like, oh, we can apply this to all these different projects. We don't have to worry about the incremental cost of having to go back and get more seats. And then the other -- the big piece is they get access to the whole platform. So there's lots of pieces of our platform that we charge incrementally for. And on consumption, we charge incrementally, but we charge it as you use it. So for instance, our data science functionality is used 4 times more frequently by our consumption customers than it is by our seat-based customers because it's an incremental expense that you have to go through a budgeting process, you have to call us. And now in consumption, you just click on it and start using it. And if you like it, you keep using it. And they like it, and they keep using it. They're using it at 4 times the rate, and that's great because it drives consumption for us. So I think having access to the full -- to all the benefits that we offer, to being able to have apps and building apps for all the different projects that you have internally, just it increases their commitment to us because they see the future that they can build with us.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. I really appreciate the thought. Thank you.\nJosh James: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital. Your line is open. Your line is open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, I was curious on the billings reset for the year. I was just looking at the midpoint of your prior outlook on billings at $344 million and then comparing that to the new midpoint at roughly $318 million. So about an 8% lower number. And I wanted to try and size that up between new logo and renewal. Did we get more pessimistic on new logo? Or is it the same level of conservatism that we had 90-days ago, and it's really more about the renewals?\nDavid Jolley: Yes. I mean there's definitely an impact to both of those. I would probably, at this point, on a weighting perspective, it might weight a little bit more towards the renewals for the second half of the year.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. And then for the -- you talked about ramped capacity historically that -- and it sounds like you're pretty happy with the progress. But what metrics can you give us as far as maybe a percentage of the total sales force that's ramped versus 90-days ago versus a year ago? Because we kind of -- it was a year ago that it first came to light that we were having issues with the ramped capacity?\nDavid Jolley: Yes. So if you -- if we go back and look a year ago, when we lost essentially, in a relatively short period of time, about 30% of the overall capacity, and that's kind of ramped and unramped, that you figure that walked out the door over a short period of time. So we had to rebuild the head count and then get them ramped. We're to a point now where we're, I would say, relatively highly ramped. We're continuing to ramp some of those folks through the rest of the third quarter and a little bit into the fourth quarter. But we feel pretty comfortable with where we're at in terms of the overall head count. We have the capacity to hit the numbers that are out there. It's just that we've seen, again, the productivity levels have not been what they have historically. And so that's been -- that's where the challenge is. But in terms of the head count and the ramped capacity, we feel pretty good about where we're at from that standpoint.\nEric Martinuzzi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Domo Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Peter Lowry, Domo Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPeter Lowry: Good afternoon, and welcome. On the call today, we have Josh James, our Founder and CEO; and David Jolley, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll lead off with our safe harbor statement and then onto the call.  Our press release was issued after the market closed and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website where this call is also being webcast. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our business under federal securities laws. These include statements about future and prospects or financial projections, our cash requirements plans and expectations for our pricing go-to-market strategy, product adoption and product impact. Our expectations for our sales team and new business opportunities and initiatives, the potential of AI and its impact on our business and the impact of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business.  These statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to documents we file with the SEC, including today's press release, our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. These documents contain and identify important risk factors and other information that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements.  In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Domo's performance. Other than revenue, unless otherwise stated, we will be discussing our results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. Please refer to the tables in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, which we have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website.  With that, I'll turn it over to Josh. Josh?\nJoshua James: Thank you, Pete, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I'm going to touch on some of my key priorities in getting back to growth, highlight a few Q1 customer wins, give some product updates, including how we're thinking about recent developments in AI.  In Q1, total revenue growth was 7%. Our subscription revenue growth was 10% and billings declined 4%. These metrics highlight the fact that 3 months ago, we walked into a situation where there were disturbing trends and trajectories. We feel good as a team that we have been able to stabilize things and reenergize the organization and get us poised for the future. My top priority as CEO is to get our growth rate up and to do so in a financially responsible manner.  What's going to bring us back to growth is a relentless focus on our customers, and a motivated and aligned sales team. I also think there's a lot of potential upside in how we price and go to market, which I will also talk about today. Focusing on our customers is exactly what I've been spending my time on since my return. It was a very productive quarter, and I couldn't be more excited about the feedback we're getting from customer interactions.  As I visited with some of our largest customers and prospects, it's clear we are providing tremendous value to some of the best brands in the world. I heard numerous examples of how companies are using Domo to foster a data-driven culture that transforms curiosity into business impact.  For example, the Chief Data Officer of one of our largest customers in Japan told me to expect broad adoption of Domo in the business. When I asked her why? She said, it's simple. I tell them if you want to use our legacy solution that's bundled with other stuff and come to me for reports, you can do that or you can just use Domo. This is an example of where our differentiation as a data experience platform really stands out. If frees IT and data professionals just like this customer from a backlog of data requests while equipping broader employees with information that will make their work more impactful.  We had another Fortune 100 companies users demonstrate how much faster we add value with data integrations and no-code apps built in 3 or 4 hours, where our top 2 competitors didn't work after 18 months of trying. We expect a large upsell there. We also had great customer interactions at our annual user conference, Domopalooza, where we heard how companies like Ford, UHG, TaylorMade and Sephora are transforming their companies with data. We launched our on-the-road customer connections tour and our Domo Central customer community hub with great success, and we're thrilled to see some of our largest international customers host their first annual Domo Day to rally their entire companies around the possibilities of our platform. And in Q1, we had a number of notable wins, all of which showcase our ability to unseat some significant competitors.  First was a new logo win with a U.S.-based construction manufacturing holding company. The company was challenged to combine the disparate data across its multiple subsidiaries through its existing provider. They chose Domo, thanks to our ability to bring it all together under 1 master parent account with complete visibility through the ease of a mobile app. We also won business with a private equity firm that chose Domo to replace its existing BI solutions because they could not integrate all the data sources they needed to report on the performance of their portfolio companies.  With Domo's robust connector library, the company is able to provide reporting across new and existing portfolio companies. And we've already started Q2 with an exciting new logo win, the Fortune 500 multinational lodging vendor chose Domo to share data with its hotel franchisees in a platform that is scalable, easy to use and cost-effective.  Domo replaced a technology from one of our most significant competitors. All of this shows the tremendous momentum we're seeing with customers around the world as we deliver agile data experiences that spark both curiosity and enable exponential business impact.  Beyond a relentless focus on our customers, another growth driver is going to be an aligned and motivated sales force. We entered this year with much more stability in our sales force than we had last year, and I feel even more confident after Q1. I've been spending a lot of time with our sales force, and I can tell you that they are incredibly motivated to go execute against the targets we have all outlined, and that includes customers of all sizes. We've aligned the sales force very closely to how we were structured when we were executing consistently well in fiscal year '21 and '22.  In Q1, we had just 5 sales reps leave the company in what is a seasonally high rep attrition quarter. We think it reflects a committed sales force. We also have a much tighter alignment between marketing and sales. The top of the funnel continues to grow. And although deals are taking longer in this environment, our pipeline is building.  And then finally, I think we have upside in how we price and go to market with our products. We've been increasing our ability to provide access to Domo on a consumption pricing basis because we believe this will remove many of the barriers to adoption and better align our pricing to the value delivered to our customers. This allows us to offer our seat licenses to our customers for free. Our visualization and seats are free and we just charge for consumption. We think this will dramatically alter our outcomes positively. We currently have over 150 customers on our consumption pricing model, which represents over 5% of our customer base and over 11% of our ARR. Initial feedback has been positive.  The consumption model enables PLG, or product-led growth, where adoption drives upsell without the need to negotiate around seats. It makes the product more discoverable because a customer has access to the entire platform, and they only pay for what they use.  In Q1, we have already seen significant upsells from companies wanting to take advantage of more premium Domo features by moving to a consumption model. For example, we are seeing our consumption customers expanding in areas like data science, whereas before they either didn't know it existed in our platform or they weren't willing to pay for it without trying it first. We've been very deliberate and careful about how we have tested and rolled it out, but we have almost a year's worth of data around it, and we are ready for prime time.  At Domopalooza in March, we also announced a variety of product updates that allow users of any skill level to unlock new data, create new content, drive action and expand their impact on the business. As a result, we're seeing a significant rise in adoption as customers realize the value of our expanding product suite. Among these products are solutions that enhance our pro-code capabilities to increase Domo's appeal to data and IT professionals, most notably, Jupyter workspaces.  We also shared several updates to low to mid-code features, including our Microsoft Office Suite integration and our variable solution, which are seeing rapid adoption across our customer base. All of these investments work together to make our customers even more successful sharing data that is actionable for everyone regardless of data acumen. The impact of our data experience platform is also earning us recognition from the industry analyst community. This quarter, Domo was named a leader in the Nucleus Research 2023 Analytics Technology Value Matrix for the third consecutive year. And for the seventh consecutive year, we were ranked the #1 vendor in the Dresner Advisory Services 2023 Cloud Computing and BI Market Study, beating out 17 other contenders. This type of recognition opens the door to new potential for increased opportunity with business and data leaders who want natural working environments that make data sharing effortless. All these investments make our customers even more successful at creating data experiences that are actionable for everyone. Clearly, it's an exciting time in our industry with emerging tech like large language models, accelerating the proliferation of AI and ML.  It has been incredible to see ChatGPT become a household resource in a matter of months and has highlighted the tremendous potential of these technologies. At Domo, we've always been excited about the promise of AI and are focused on integrating it in ways that add tangible value to our customers' data environments. True to our business, we tailor our AI solutions to benefit everyone across an organization from data scientists and app developers to business users and leaders and AI is only as powerful as the data connected to it. We happen to have the most end-to-end connected data stack in the world, opening up numerous possibilities with workflows, alert-based actions and automated apps. Businesses recognize the transformative potential of AI, but many grapple with how to optimally integrate and manage the diverse range of AI models available without being locked into a single one such as or Google Bard.  Although these large language models has significant power, enterprise use cases are still nascent compared to the outcomes driving the hype cycle. What's different about our AI service layer is that it gives businesses the freedom to select and integrate models securely. And by simplifying and infusing flexibility into the process, businesses can take advantage of the power of AI without being bogged down by the complexities of the AI ecosystem. The result is that our customers have control over which models are used, how and when, it's easy to manage, deploy and optimize and let users host their own models and solutions right in our data experience platform to support real-world use cases that matter to everyone, technical and business teams alike.  And I'm excited to announce here today that our AI service layer will be available in June. I'm also excited to announce that our AI Text to SQL, our AI text to Beast Mode and our AI text generation are available now, access via a Domo Brick in the Domo app store. We believe we will be a powerful player in the AI field, as it develops.  In closing, I've been back for a quarter. We have turned the ship around and are building momentum in the right direction. Over the next 2 to 3 quarters, I anticipate we will see these efforts start to show in renewed increasing growth rates. We have the right products, we have the market opportunity, and we have the sales capacity we need to grow. The entire company is energized to execute for the remainder of the year, and I'm very confident in our future.  All right. Over to you, David.\nDavid Jolley: Thanks, Josh. I'm also very bullish about Domo's prospects after having been in the seat now for almost 3 months. In Q1, we posted 10% subscription revenue growth and 7% total revenue growth. We slightly exceeded the billings guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We delivered Q1 billings of $70.3 million, a year-over-year decrease of a little under 4%.  In reviewing the metrics that will impact the remainder of the year, our current RPO of $237.5 million grew 6% year-over-year, and our total RPO grew 1% to $356.7 million, our ARR grew in line with our subscription revenue growth. An area where we saw continued success was multiyear contracts, on a dollar-weighted measure, we now have 65% of our customers in our multiyear contracts at the end of Q1, up from 64% a year ago. Our gross retention improved from Q4 and approach nearly 90%, and our net retention was just above 100%, down slightly from Q4. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, our NRR would have been about 2% higher.  Q1 total revenue was $79.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 7%. Subscription revenue represented 89% of total revenue and grew at 10% year-over-year. International revenue in the quarter represented 21% of total revenue consistent with Q1 of last year. Our subscription gross margin was 85.9%, up 1.3 percentage points from Q1 of last year and up 0.3 percentage points from Q4, reflecting continued optimization of our third-party hosting services.  In Q1, our non-GAAP operating margin was up 2.7 percentage points from a year ago, non-GAAP operating margin primarily excludes stock-based compensation as well as executive severance, which was related to the transition of C-level executives.  Our net loss was $6.1 million, down from $7.6 million a year ago, and our net loss per share was $0.17. This is based on 35.2 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In Q1, cash provided by operations was $800,000. In total, our cash balance declined just $0.5 million from last quarter to $66 million. We expect second quarter cash flow from operations to be slightly negative. However, we continue to expect full year fiscal '24 forecast from operations to be positive.  We believe we've got adequate cash in order to continue to pursue our business objectives. While we're pleased that our actual results for Q1 came in better than our original model expectations for sales rep attrition and gross retention our Q2 and full year guidance reflects continued conservatism about how the macro may impact conversion rates and timing and resulting new business. For Q2, we are guiding to billings of about $69 million to $70 million, which is relatively flat sequentially, consistent with the trend we've seen over the past 3 years and down 5% year-over-year.  For full year billings growth, we are providing a range of about $335 million to $353 million, representing a range of 4% to 9% growth. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we continue to believe we're in a good position to accelerate our billings over the first half outlook as we expect growth in our ramped sales capacity to accelerate.  Now to guidance for our GAAP metrics. For the second quarter of FY '24, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $78.5 million to $79.5 million. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share basic and diluted of $0.07 to $0.11. This assumes 35.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted.  For the full year of fiscal '24, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $323 million to $330 million, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 7%. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share basic and diluted of $0.27 to $0.39. This assumes 36.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. Our EPS guidance implies a positive operating margin in Q2 and for the full year. Our annual guidance is consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter.  In closing, we were able to achieve our Q1 results that were in line to slightly better than expectations as outlined in our guidance last quarter. We believe we have great alignment between sales and marketing and a sales force that is reenergized to hit their quotas and we believe we're in a good position to accelerate our billings in the second half of the year as the sales reps we have on board continue to ramp.  With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\nJames Wood: Josh, I know one of the initiatives you plan to focus on was rebuilding the large deal pipeline. I just -- just wondering if you could shed some light on what that looks like? Is that reengaging with C-level folks at existing customers? Is that identifying some larger new prospects. Just wondering how those efforts have gotten off the ground and when you are thinking about kind of how that translates into dividends and closed deals in the quarters ahead.\nDavid Jolley: Sorry, can you repeat that first question?\nJames Wood: Yes. Can you hear me?\nDavid Jolley: Yes.\nJoshua James: Yes, we can now. We had to change to rooms. We had a technical issue on our side. So yes please repeat.\nJames Wood: Okay. Yes. So Josh, I was asking about the efforts in building large deal pipelines and I know that was going to be a big focus for you. Just was hoping to kind of hear what some of those initiatives look like? Is that trying to reengage with C-level folks at existing customers? Is that building up new large prospects. Just wondering how those efforts have gotten off the ground and how you're thinking about the sales cycles and when the dividend should start to pay off?\nJoshua James: Yes, Great. Yes, I mean it's not so much about the big deal pipeline is just reengaging with customers anywhere and everywhere. So any of the reps that have interesting relationships from conversations with customers and prospects, definitely trying to go out and see them. I'm sure I'm talking to at least 1 or 2 customers a day and a lot of travel. And just again, like I mentioned in the prepared remarks, trying to reengage the sales force, get everyone excited and make sure the whole company sees that we're leaning in, doing anything and everything we can to close the deals and then upsell.  And I would say in terms of the big deal pipeline, that's probably been the biggest difference maker is going into our current accounts where we already have established relationships where they are already thinking positively and they're predisposed to want to do more business with us. and finding the senior level executives there, facilitating conversations, and that's worked.  And we have found a bunch of opportunities, definitely increase the pipeline meaningfully for the enterprise business in particular. And in terms of when that will come to fruition when we'll start seeing those dollars. I think there's a chance that we could see some of that this quarter. Definitely, we'll see those things in Q3 and Q4 playing out.  But yes, a lot of great conversations, a lot of customers leaning in. The macro is certainly not as positive as it has been historically as we all know. But one thing that we've seen with our customers because we do help them save money, we do help them find revenue. If we already have a relationship, we're already -- relationship, we're already an established vendor we can find deals intra-quarter that aren't on their project list. And because they trust is we can do a quick proof-of-concept and away we go. So I think we're going to find some contracts that way.\nJames Wood: Yes, that's great to hear. On the consumption push, it sounds like there's a little bit of a change in focus here. Maybe stepping on the pedal a little bit more. Can you just talk about how broad you're going to try to push this? And when you do flip customers to consumption, is it kind of net neutral initially? And then do you see stronger expansion motions once you kind of get customers on board?  And then just kind of a third part to that, is that a way to monetize some of the stuff you're doing with generative AI, it seems like that could be an easier way to monetize LLMs and some of the things that come with that?\nJoshua James: For sure, for sure. Yes, it helps us -- there's a lot of functionality we've added into the platform over the years. But when you're charging per seat, every single time they want to try something, you have to go out and they have to get approval for it internally. And then we have to get them into some kind of a trial and now with the way we're doing things with consumption, it's all just sitting there at the fingertips.  And so they can try it out and pay for it for the day that they use it or 2 days that they use it and it just really provides a lot more flexibility. One of the things that we've seen already is with our data science, our data science efforts that we have, which leads us right into the AI conversations. The take rate from our consumption customers is more than double than it is for our regular customer base. And that's -- our consumption customers have only been with us for a year. So it's -- that's something that we're seeing is the take rate on the addition of products and services is dramatically different.  In terms of -- I think you asked a couple of different parts of your question. In terms of the pace, yes, we are definitely speeding it up. The more data we get, the more excited we get. And so that gives us the confidence to be able to lean into it. I was -- I tried to be very thoughtful in the remarks that we made that we've been very judicious and deliberate about evaluating this change. And as people internally are quoting, it's not just a change in pricing, it's a change in approach.  We get to go and interact with our customers and help them find ways to improve their business without having any conversations about seats. We get to be more consultative in terms of the relationships that we have with them. And this is definitely also in response to Power BI. There's -- I've had conversations with CIOs of Fortune 100 companies that tell me that Power BI is free. I'm like, \"Oh, that's great. So are we\". And they look at me kind of funny, I'm like, yes, we're exactly free, exactly the same way that Power BI is free. And they're like, what do you mean? I'm like will you pay for Power BI. Every time you use it, you pay for it. You have an Azure account that you pay for. And they're like, \"Oh, yes, I guess that is true, but they're free. So are we\". We're free. free99, baby, we are free.  And I think that resonates really well with customers. And by definition, if we don't have site-wide license, then they're using our competitors. So this will help us shore up all the relationships that we have, I think, in a more meaningful way and then provide a lot more opportunities for growth because you're not limited to the use cases that they got approval for beforehand to purchase. Now there's use cases that are popping up and there's people all over the organization that are trying things. So we've definitely noticed that when we sign up a customer via consumption compared to seat licenses, that after 12 months, we have a higher contract value, a meaningfully higher contract value from our consumption model than we do from the traditional user-based licensing. So I don't know if you want to add anything, David, to that.\nDavid Jolley: Yes. I guess the thing that's impressed me is just, again, to reiterate what Josh said, how judicious we've been on the front end to really be careful about -- it's not just a change in pricing, it's a change in philosophy of how we engage with our customers. It becomes then more about helping them identify those solutions that drive further adoption. And so it requires our AEs to think a little bit differently as well. And we've been very careful about that on the front end, and all the indicators have been very positive. So I think compounding what Josh said, I think, the plan is to continue to accelerate that. Still some things that we need to do from an internal standpoint to make sure we've got all the right controls and process from an accounting perspective. But those are things that we'll just lean in to get focused on and then go much broader with our account base.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. This is [indiscernible] on for Sanjit. Greatly the announcements around AI and obviously, with consumption pricing that starts to make a lot of sense. I want to ask sort of 2 questions on it. One, strategically, how are you thinking about distributions and particularly the world of partnerships as it relates to AI on a go-forward basis? And then tactically, what are you seeing on the ground sort of today with customers? Is there any sense that customers are kind of pausing and evaluating the environment? Or are customers already sort of leading into this?\nJoshua James: Yes. Customers are definitely already leading into this. I think the biggest highlight for Domo is anybody out there that's trying to use data with artificial intelligence. To the extent that AI can be effective, it's limited by the data that it's connected to, the systems that it's connected to. And we happen to have the stack that's tightly integrated, and we would contend as the most integrated data stack in existence. And it's been a . It's been very difficult to build what we've built, but at the same time, the -- we have all the metadata about the data that's inside our system. We know what connectors it came from. We know what's stored, where it's stored, how it's connected, how the data interplays and can take that all the way into data science, machine learning and AI. And we do have customers leaning in quite a meaningful way.  And I think true to form, we've been pretty agnostic and we'll be agnostic about AI as well. So we'll integrate with the entire ecosystem and if you want to come in and you found that there is a specialized AI focusing on, let's say, for instance, pricing or focusing on optimization of your supply chain, focusing on inventory levels, whatever it is that you find this AI model and you want to integrate and use that with the data that you have in Domo, we'll definitely facilitate that. So we're very excited about the prospects. We think it's going to help really leverage the uniqueness of what we have built here at Domo.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.\nOwen Hobbs: This is Owen Hobbs on for Pat. So I was wondering if you guys could just give some commentary on what you're seeing in the demand environment for different geographies.\nJoshua James: In the demand environment through different what?\nOwen Hobbs: Different geographies.\nJoshua James: Okay. Right now, most of the geographies are pretty much the same. We've got -- I think the biggest thing that we've noticed is if you have an established relationship, with a customer, you have an ability to get in there and sell additional products. If you have an established relationship with the prospect and you've been working with them for a quarter or 2 and they've identified a project internally it's important. And they've had time internally to lay out their case for why they should make this investment in Domo, then those are the deals that are still getting done.  The deals that aren't getting done in any geo is, we cold call into your accounts and maybe we've met you once or twice at different conferences or in webinars, and we call in and you have no project identified trying to create that project from scratch right now and getting that approved is next to impossible.  And so it's -- that's what's dried up, people are just pausing and we're not losing deals. We're still getting the leads and they're just going and pipeline is just building for customers that aren't ready to make a decision. So hopefully, as the macro returns at some point, we'll have a whole bunch of opportunities and projects where we've been talking with prospects. But in terms of geo, Japan continues to be successful for us. We made investment there early, actually it was the first country that we went to before we even went to London, and that continues to be a good business for us. And internationally, again, the rest of the international geos, I would say, just mostly focused on where we have customers, where we have references.  And then the number one type of new deal that we get is a Domo customer that was a user at one of our previous customers and they go to a new account, and then they call us and say, \"I want to do exactly the same thing\". And those are the deals that we'll get intra-quarter.\nOwen Hobbs: Great. And Josh, one for you. So this is your first full quarter back, I guess, kind of in general, retrospectively, how do you feel you guys performed versus expectations coming in?\nJoshua James: Well, I think you walk in, you kind of -- the hands has already been built. So you look at the hands, you try to play it the best you can and you set yourselves up for the next round, and that's what we're really trying to do. We're trying to play the hand that we have the best we can. And we mentioned everybody that -- we weren't sandbagging last time around. It was like hold on through dear life and try to make sure that we optimize this thing, we get it to cash flow breakeven and net operating margin positive within those constraints, then get the assets moved in the right places, get this swagger back, get the relationships with the customers, get some deals closed, get some momentum, get some juice because it's infectious. And I think that confidence is here.  I had a conversation with our sales consultants -- sales engineers yesterday. And I asked the question, I'm like, okay, there's a bunch of stuff going on that's not so positive in the macro, and we've had to make those adjustments here internally as well. How are you all doing with that. I kind of get a bunch of dumb looks in return, like why are you asking us that question. Yes, we get. We -- of course, we get it. Let's go. We're rallying. We're not in a pessimistic negative situation here. Let's go win some accounts. So it is really refreshing to kind of take the temperature of the team. And I think everyone here is excited about what we're doing.  Consumption is going to be a game changer for us, being able to tell the world and tell customers when they're sitting there looking at Power BI for \"free\" and knowing that our visualization layer is free as well, our seats are free as well and moving all of our accounts over to consumption as quickly as we can is something that's energizing, knowing that we've got a freemium right on the heels of that, we generate over $10 million in freemium last year which is not a number that we're going to continue to provide, but just to help people understand the significance of that opportunity for us. And that's something that we're really focused on optimizing and improving and consumption makes that conversation a whole lot easier.  So I think there's a lot of people here that are really excited about the prospects of the future. AI couldn't happen to a better company because we're so integrated top to bottom. We don't have 95 partners in order to make data platform and your data experience work. We are that data platform, we are that data experience. So AI really facilitates and dramatically improves the speed at which you can do things. So we're very excited about those prospects as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your final question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. I just wanted to confirm the billing guide for Q2 is that $69 million to $70 million?\nDavid Jolley: Yes, that's right.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. So assuming we come in at the midpoint of that, we'd have kind of a down 4% for the front half of the year. In order to get to that full year kind of midpoint range, we need to be coming in double digits on the billings growth in Q3 and Q4. And I'm just -- I'm wondering what you guys are seeing in the pipeline that gives you that confidence to reiterate the year given the Q2 billings outlook.\nDavid Jolley: Yes. So a couple of observations there. Going back, if you look at our historical results over the last 3 years, Q1 and Q2 are very close from a billing standpoint. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last several cycles. And there is a bit of seasonality in the buying patterns of our clients. And so we've historically seen just a natural increase. I think the thing that adds to that for us this year is we added a lot of new sales reps in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, and it takes some time for those reps to ramp.  And so we see a natural or full ramping of those reps in Q3 and Q4. And as a result -- and that's really how we evaluate their performances once they've been ramped, and they're really familiar with the product, the offerings, the accounts. And so as they become fully ramped in Q3 and Q4, there is a natural acceleration. And so that's what's -- that's built into the model. So that was a -- that's a conscious that's not just to push everything back to the back end of the year. It truly is based on how we've built our sales executives.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. And then, Josh, maybe if you could speak for changes that have been made on the, I guess, maybe a sales management question. I don't know if Jeff is available or not, but the CRO changes since taken over 90 days ago, everything from training, mentorship, travel, demos, what changes have been made with the new hires here versus how they were handled before.\nJoshua James: Yes. I think Jeff's really known quantity. He had the majority of the team working for him before. He had relationships with the international folks because they'd go to sales kickoffs together. They'd go to sales trainings together. So very known quantity was very well respected, and there's just different ways of doing things. And we think for the time and place that we're at right now, we're going to see some positive momentum from that. The team certainly energized and excited, and there's highly competitive spirits, and there's definitely a lot of rallying together and so it definitely feels like 1 team here across all the organization I'd say, more than probably it ever has in my 13 years here.  So maybe the first couple of years when we're -- when we don't know what we're doing, yes, everyone is pretty excited. But in terms of the last 7 or 8 years, it feels like we're more unified than we've been. So in that sense, I think Jeff plays a part in that certainly, and there's a lot of rigor in the way that Jeff does things and there's really high expectations in the way that Jeff does team -- does things.  All the managers across the board for the most part came from his organization at this point. And then there's a few other people that he's brought in and a few people that have just kind of made it through all these years. So it just -- it feels really good. The team is really excited. The reps are really excited. And I think with the changes that we're making, that we're seeing with AI, that we're seeing with consumption, with the ability to get all these different products out to our customers so that they can try them out and use them and the upsells that come from the customer successes, not because we're trying to convince you that maybe you should look at something, but truly because they're having success already and it's spreading inside the organization, that's a really fun way to be a rep. So I think people are pretty excited about the future in that regard.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. And then if I could just get some insight on the ramped sales capacity, is it where you expected it to be? I know you talked about almost a record low turnover here in Q1, but there's 2 parts to it. There's the new hires and then there's also retention of your installed base of reps -- or are we getting -- or what we're expecting as far as the total headcount versus ramped sales capacity.\nDavid Jolley: Yes, I'll take that one. The answer -- the short answer is yes. The folks that we brought in, in the latter half of last year, I think they're continuing to ramp nicely. And we haven't -- we haven't had really what we call any sort of regrettable turnover in the first quarter. We feel really good about where we're at. And we've got some more hires out there on the horizon, but we're bringing those in sort of in an orderly way. And the other thing I'd add is we've had QBRs over the last couple of weeks. And so we've had most of the different reps here at headquarters and hearing a lot about the experiences that they're having and the discussions they're having is all very positive.  And to reiterate, Josh brings a certain amount of just excitement and energy back to the organization. And that is especially true in the sales organization. And you can feel it in talking with them. They're really excited about the opportunity about some of these new things that we've got on the horizon, whether it's a pricing model or they're really excited and anxious to lean in on those things. So I think those are all working out as we had hoped.\nJoshua James: I'd add also, it's not just Jeff Skousen that's new here, right? We've got Mark Maughan in the new role, but he's been here forever. So very similar to Jeff, very well respected across the organization. And very -- one of the highest rated folks that we had here in management and now he's got a lot more responsibility. So he gets to prove himself, but that's exactly the kind of situation that you want, and everyone in this organization has been really excited. So it's been fun to get all that feedback.  Daren Thayne, he was responsible for the entire product and then he -- we had an opportunity to get Catherine and he wanted to shift over to more of engineering services and spending a lot of time with customers because we really didn't understand the market at that time. But now he's back in that role where he has entire responsibility for the product and it's a new style and it's invigorating. And he's really excited and his team is really excited and the pace of innovation is definitely different. So I think that brings a new amount of energy.  And then David Jolley being new as well. That's a new amount of energy. So really across the whole organization, Wendy's on the newish front still. It's a new team that we all get to prove to each other what we can do into our organization, what we can do. And it feels like a new start-up in a lot of senses, but we just happen to have $300 million of recurring revenue and a great customer base and a huge platform that we spent a lot of money investing into. So it feels like we're poised really well for the future, really the macro to pick up a little bit. But with the sales capacity that's coming, we think there's still an opportunity to get back to some good growth.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.\nJoshua James: All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it."
