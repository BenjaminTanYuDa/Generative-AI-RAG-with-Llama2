Fermi?\nFermi Wang: Thank you, Louis, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, our revenue increased about 2% sequentially, and we slightly exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Thanks to the early actions we took to help our customers navigate their excess inventory, our business continued to stabilize, and it's beginning to recover. For the full fiscal year 2024, our revenue declined 32.9% year-over-year, as our customers digested inventory resulting from the industry-wide semiconductor cyclical downturn. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, we continue to expect both our automotive and IoT business to grow. As the cyclical challenges went and the secular growth of AI strategy emerges. Our customers currently have a cumulative install base of more than 20 million AI inference SoCs, all from our 10-nanometer CV2 family and the 5-nanometer CV5. This is based on approximately 280 customer products that have a rich production on a cumulative basis. The CV2 family is expected to continue to be the key driver of our revenue growth in fiscal year 2025. Our AI inference business, all in-age applications, represented approximately 60% of total fiscal 2024 revenue, and it was the key factor in the meetings percent year-over-year increase in our blended ASP. The trend to a richer mix of AI revenue and higher averaging selling price is expected to continue. In particular, the CV3 SoC family enters production. At this time, virtually all of our customers' new design activity involves our AI inference processors. In fact, this was the first year at the CES where all of our SoC demos, more than 30, were based on our AI inference products. Fiscal 2024 was certainly challenging for most of the industry. However, there were key industry developments and the company's specific achievements that we believe leave us very well positioned for growth as the market recovery plays out. For the industry, in the past, the AI process opportunity had primarily been represented by training GPUs in server located in data centers, and this is a market that we do not serve. However, in the last year, the important role and opportunity for inference processors, in particular at that age, has become better understood, and this is exactly where we have been focused on. Internally, we achieved four key milestones during the last year. First, we have now shipped more than 500,000 units of our first 5-nanometer SoC, CV5, and we expect our shipments in fiscal year 2025 to possibly double. Most of CV5 volume is currently in our IoT business, although we expect an automotive OEM to start production in the second half of the year. The fact that we have already achieved a high volume mass production at 5-nanometer helps pave the way for our other 5-nanometer SoC, such as the CV3 family. Second, the automotive market resembles both the high-end production version of our 5-nanometer CV3, as well as a 5-nanometer version for China. At the high end, we sample CV3-AD685, targeting L3 and above autonomy, and this central domain controller is currently evaluated, is in evaluation at multiple OEMs and tier ones globally. So far, we are finding success in L3 and above commercial vehicles. For the basic highway L2 plus opportunity in China, we introduced a CV72AQ, and we have numerous tier one design wins and OEM discussions underway. Third, we introduced our generative AI, Gen AI strategy for the age of the network, and we are sampling our 5-nanometer N1 processor, targeting age applications, ranging from IoT devices to age servers. Fourth, we'll continue to build out the CV3 automotive platform to offer our Tier 1and OEM customers turnkey options with our software stack and our centrally processed HD radar algorithms. We started the new year at the Consumer Electronics Show, CES, where we hosted over 200 customer meetings and made a number of significant announcements for automotive, Gen AI, and our new Cooper Development Platform. We were pleased to receive a CES Innovation Award for the second year in a row, this time for our centralized radar processing architecture. In December, we unveiled our latest software stack for Level 2 Plus and the higher autonomous driving applications. This software is optimized and can scale across our entire CV3 processor family, enabling OEM to get to market faster and reduce development costs. The new software stack, including the perception, fusion, and planning layers, is primarily deep learning based, which allows software development to scale more easily, resulting in a more accurate solution. Finally, most important, we rely on high resolution camera and the radar perception data to create a real-time map inside the vehicle. And for this reason, we eliminate the use of stored HD maps that may contain stale data, which results in improved results and a reduced cost for OEM. If needed, the software stack is available in modules and can be combined with an OEM's own software intellectual property. During the CES show, we demonstrated a stack running on a single CV3 automotive AI domain processor in our own autonomous vehicle, successfully completing over 150 autonomous drives. The demonstration integrated our Oculii radar algorithm for the first time. We also announced the expansion of our CV3 processor family with the addition of our CV3 AD635 and the 655 SoCs. The new CV3-AD635 supports a sensing suite that includes multiple cameras and radars to enable mainstream level 2 plus feature set, such as highway autopilot and automated parking, in addition to meeting the GSR2 and NCAP standards. Additionally, the 655 enables advanced level 2 plus with urban autopilot, as well as the support for additional cameras, radars, and other sensors. With the previously announced flagship 685 SoC, along with the ChinaFolk's CV72 AQ SoC, the CV3 family of four processors now covers the full range of AD and ADAS solutions, from mainstream to premium passenger vehicles. The new CV3-AD SoCs were endorsed by our partner Continental. Kodiak Robotics, a leading autonomous vehicle company focused on trucking and defense, announced that it had selected our CV3-AD685 AI domain controller for its next generation autonomous vehicles. In IoT markets, during CES, we announced we are bringing Gen-AI capabilities to the edge through the introduction of our N1 processor for on-premises applications. This SoC supports up to 34 billion parameters, multimodal large language models, LLMs, with low power consumption, enabling Gen-AI for edge applications. We demonstrated multimodal LLMs running on the new N1 processor at a fraction of the power per inference of leading GPU solutions. Ambarella aims to bring Gen-AI to a wide range of edge applications, including video security, robotics, and industrial applications. Quanta Computer announced it was partnering with Ambarella to develop products based on our CV3-AD685, CV72, and new N1 processor to address cutting-edge AI devices. This offering addresses the up growing market demand for a diverse range of neural networks and LLMs and the well-empowered business across sectors, including autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, robotics, and healthcare. Quanta demonstrated PCIe add-in cards based on our N1, as well as showing automotive ECUs based on CV3-AD685. We also introduced and demonstrated our new Cooper developer platform. Cooper offers seamless integration of software, hardware, state-of-the-art, fine-tuned AI models, and services that provide universal support across Ambarella's entire portfolio of AI SoCs. We have now successfully deployed Cooper to some of our IoT customers worldwide. I will now quickly highlight some of the customer products announced and made during the last quarter. In the Chinese automotive market, we continue to expand our position in this important market. During the quarter, GAC Auto announced Aion S Max passenger car with combination driver monitoring and in-cabin sensing based on our CV25 AQ automotive AI vision processor. GAC also introduced this Trumpchi M8 passenger car with driver monitoring and the multi-channel occupancy monitoring also based on our CV25 AQ. And in January, XPENG unveiled its X9 minivan including an electronic mirror system based on our A12 automotive SoC. And in the enterprise IoT market, career market leader Hanha [ph] Vision introduced multiple models based on AI vision SoC including 4K and the four-channel multi-directional cameras based on our CV2 SoCs. And the AI thermal camera based on our CV22 SoCs. All Korean camera supplier IDIS introduced a 2-megapixel voice-over-IP video intercom based on our CV28 SoC. And Taiwan-based VivoTech also introduced this new 87-V3 family of IP camera based on our CV22 AI SoCs and featuring fixed-on and bully models with advanced AI capabilities. And in the home monitoring market, Canadian service provider TELUS announced its home view doorbell camera based on our CV28M AI SoC and featuring advanced AI detection. In summary, looking forward our key objectives to restore revenue growth and profitability while continuing to drive our strategic R&D priorities for AI inference process opportunities at the edge. To achieve this goal, we're highly focused on commercialization of technology and products we have developed. And in particular, converting the multiple RFIs and RFQs we are currently working on for CV2 and CV3 into awarded business. Furthermore, returning our IoT business to its positive secular growth trajectory is very important. And this includes our early business development for our new Gen AI and one-price. In conclusion, we have not been distracted by the prolonged industry-wide cynical downturn. And we see the secular trends we address, safety, security, and automation remaining very strong. The increased market attention on inference processing, in particular at the edge, is aligned with where we have been investing. In the new year, we are very excited about the opportunities we are working on and look forward to move more business into one column. And I'm excited about what we will achieve in the years ahead. With that, John will now discuss the Q4 and the full-year fiscal year 2024 results and outlook in more details.\nJohn Young: Thank you, Fermi. Before I begin, I would like to say that I'm honored to assume the CFO role. I've been working with the team for seven years and I'm very excited to help the company as it pursues growth in its target markets. I'll now review the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024, ending January 31st, 2024. I will also provide a financial outlook for our first quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending April 30th, 2024. I will be discussing non-GAAP results and ask that you refer to today's press release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For non-GAAP reporting, we have eliminated stock-based compensation expense, along with acquisition-related and restructuring costs adjusted for the impact of taxes. Fiscal year 2024 revenue decreased 32.9% to $226.5 million. IoT revenue was about two-thirds of the total revenue and declined about 40% for the year. Auto revenue represented the balance of revenue and declined about 14% for the year. From a product point of view, a large majority of our fiscal 2024 revenue decline was from our human viewing video processor, SoCs. For fiscal year 2024, non-GAAP gross margin was 63.3% versus 63.9% in fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP operating expense increased 3.9% for the year versus 17.6% in the prior year. Ending cash and marketable securities totaled $219.9 million up from $206.9 million at the end of the prior year. For fiscal Q4, revenue was $51.6 million, slightly above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, up 2% from the prior quarter, and down 38% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal Q4 was 62.5% in line with our prior guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expense was $44.1 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter, and below our prior guidance range of $45 million to $48 million, driven by continued expense management and the timing of spending between quarters. We remain on track to our internal product development milestones. Q4 net interest and other income was $2.1 million. Q4 non-GAAP tax provision was approximately $119,000. In fiscal Q4, we recorded a one-time GAAP non-cash tax charge of $22.7 million, establishing a valuation allowance on certain U.S. deferred tax assets that were deemed more likely than not to be unrealizable in the foreseeable future. This valuation allowance was excluded from fiscal Q4 non-GAAP tax provision, consistent with our historical practice for changes to tax valuation allowances. This adjustment is a non-cash tax charge required by GAAP based on the proportion of taxable income in the United States. We reported a non-GAAP net loss of $9.8 million, or a $0.24 loss per diluted share. Now I'll turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. Fiscal Q4 cash and marketable securities decreased $2.4 million from the prior quarter to $219.9 million. Receivables days of sales outstanding increased from 42 days in the prior quarter to 44 days, while days of inventory decreased from 145 to 131 days. Inventory dollars declined 6% sequentially and declined 28% from a year ago. Operating cash outflow was $4 million for the quarter, and for the full year we generated operating cash inflow of $19 million. Capital expenditures for tangible and intangible assets were $1.9 million for the quarter and $12 million for the year. We had two logistics and ODM companies representing 10% or more of our revenue in Q4. WT Microelectronics, a fulfillment partner in Taiwan that ships to multiple customers in Asia, came in at 55% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 53% for the full fiscal year 2024. Chicony, an ODM who manufactures for multiple end customers, was 14% of revenue for both the quarter and the full fiscal year 2024. I'll now discuss the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Our early actions during the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry have helped our customers navigate their high inventory balances, and these actions are now enabling our business to stabilize and begin to recover. For fiscal Q1, we estimate our total revenue will be in the range of $52 million to $56 million. We expect sequential growth in both IoT and auto. We expect fiscal Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61.5% to 63%. We expect non-GAAP OpEx in the first quarter to be in the range of $46 million to $49 million, with the increase compared to Q4 driven by new product development costs and employee-related expenses, which we were able to delay in previous quarters. We estimate net interest income to be approximately $1.5 million, our non-GAAP tax expense to be approximately $500,000, and our diluted share count to be approximately 40.8 million shares. Ambarella will be participating in a fireside chat and hosting one-on-one and group meetings on February 29th in New York City at Susquehanna's Technology Conference. We will also be participating in Morgan Stanley's TMT Conference in San Francisco on Monday, March 4th. On March 18th, we will participate in the ROTH Conference in Southern California. We hope to see you at one of these events. Please contact us for more details. Thank you for joining our call today, and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Now, first question coming from the line of Quinn Boulton from Needham. Your line is open.\nNeil Young: Hey, this is Neil Young on for Quinn Boulton. Thank you for taking my questions. So you said you were seeing project delays from Tier 1s and OEMs, as well as volume reductions in planned projects, which you called out more of an inventory issue. How's that inventory improvement -- or I should say, is that inventory improvement progressing ahead of where you thought it would? And if so, are you starting to get the sense that these projects will resume soon? And then I had a follow-up.\nFermi Wang: So you are referring to what we said a quarter before?\nNeil Young: Yes.\nFermi Wang: So I think in November, when we provide, I think early December, when we provide our final guidance for this year, I think we talk about there's a project got pushed out, and OEM Tier 1s, also some decision for a new project also got delayed. And also there's some inventory. I think what we are saying is still consistent with what we have said in December last year. I think there's no new updates. I don't think -- we haven't seen new development in terms of a further project got delayed or pushed out.\nNeil Young: Okay. So on the auto side, regarding inventory, you aren't seeing any improvements?\nFermi Wang: We haven't seen any improvement, but we are not saying there's -- it's getting worse.\nNeil Young: Okay. Thanks. And then for my follow-up. So in the past, you talked about how the first CV3 revenue would come from China. I believe in your opening remarks, I heard you say you're engaged in discussion with multiple Tier 1s and already have multiple design wins on the way. If that's the case, when do you think you'll see first revenue from those wins? And then maybe just an update on the demand environment in China.\nFermi Wang: Right. So for CV70 to 8Q, we expected that the first revenue from those design wins would be in calendar year 2026. We have talked about this in a previous call. And basically, that was a low end CV70 to 8Q is basically the low end of CV3 family and addressing first level of Level 2+, for example, for the ADAS plus smart parking. So that's the no market in China, and we're working on. We already have design with Tier 1 and working with OEM design wins right now. But I think for the market development point of view, I think China continues to be one of the focus areas that we are in because I think that -- I think everybody sees the EV development in China and we believe autonomous driving also will happen in China faster than other areas. So that's definitely we believe we can monetize our CV3 technology in China faster than any other areas.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristopher Rolland: Hi, thanks for the question. Just about your N1 product, maybe any more thoughts on how large this could be for you guys? Have you considered or has anyone talked about combining multiple chips into a server or appliance? And then lastly, does this meet the Chinese compute restrictions for import as well? Thanks.\nFermi Wang: Right. So first of all, in terms of N1, we definitely believe that -- first of all, technically we can put multiple chips together and to serve a high-end solution. But so far, we believe a single chip solution at the edge will meet demands for a lot of our current customers, maybe even new customers. But I do see a point if you want to go to the edge server side that with multiple chips will provide a better solution. Definitely that's the direction we are looking at. And the current solution that, for example, we demo with our partners building PCIe card today is a single chip solution, but it can be multiple chips in the future. In terms of the American regulation, I think N1, because our architecture, although we can provide high performance at very low power consumption. But our total tops, top number as well as the bandwidth, is much lower than our competition. And that's our strength, our architecture, that we can use a smaller top number and lower bandwidth to achieve similar or higher performance.\nChristopher Rolland: Great. Thank you for your comments.\nJohn Young: Chris, in terms of the market size, we've had many discussions at CES and afterwards with customers on our Gen AI and LLM products. And we see really good feedback about what these products can do. And many customers, we found out, just were not aware that Gen AI models like Lava could run so efficiently on a sub 50-watt SoC. And so this has triggered a lot of discussions with our customers and how they're going to use the product. And we're going to wait to put some market sizing figures out until we're a little bit farther down that process. But the feedback's really good, especially doing this on a sub 50-watt SoC.\nFermi Wang: Great. Do you have a follow up, Chris?\nChristopher Rolland: Yeah. Maybe around the kind of edge AI and camera opportunity. Maybe if you could describe that. I mean, there's so much focus on auto. But Next Gen, like security cameras with all this AI functionality, what are growth rates for that market? Do you have now visibility into a funnel to kind of refresh that and to revigorate that market? And what kind of growth could we be talking for kind of that edge market as well with your products? Thanks.\nJohn Young: Well, for our SAM, we haven't updated it for Gen AI, kind of like the prior discussion, so we're still sizing that up. But the prior SAM CAGR, if you will, that we talked about was in the low teens range, thinking of a five-year SAM CAGR for that market. But that does not include the Gen AI products. And we're going to take a little bit longer to put those numbers in. In terms of kind of the insight into building momentum in this market and any sort of funnel, I'll pass that off to Fermi.\nFermi Wang: Yes. In fact, although we talk a lot about auto because that's a huge opportunity, but we never underestimate the importance of security camera market for us. This is really a big portion of our revenue. And we continue to believe that the edge AI application for security cameras is important for us. And we continue to develop new platform. For example, we announced the CV72 and we'll announce new chips for this market in the near future. So, I think we believe that the AI performance demand in security camera will continue to grow. And we want to continue to be the player and the dominant player on the mainstream high-end product line.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Matt Ramsey with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatthew Ramsay: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I guess, Fermi, I wanted to follow up with you on some of the initial feedback on the N1 from an inference perspective. And I guess it's not a surprise to me, given that the engineering and architecture team is getting good feedback on low power inference. I guess my question is, as you get that good feedback and you're interacting with customers that can potentially ramp this product over time, given where the P&L is for you guys right now during the correction, what's the business model over the next 12 month to 18 months to start to really build a business around this and get something that could ramp at scale, given the software investments that you need, etcetera? Are customers willing and are you willing to do sort of NRE payment arrangements? Are people willing to invest alongside you on software? I'm just trying to figure out. I can see big potential here, but there's also some limitations on capital, given where the business is. And I'm trying to understand what the discussions are to get you from point A to point B if this is going to be a big product.\nFermi Wang: Right. So I think you make a good point. I think for the N1 development, it's going to be significant for us. But that's why we are open for any kind of business model, including from partnership to NRE numbers. I think with N1, we only can address some of the cost, particularly our existing customer demand. And also on the software, in fact, we can demo and show you that our investment on the software and tools and the silicon can be leveraged for our first-generation chip. So from that point of view, I think the majority of our investment for N1 is done. So the real question is what's our roadmap moving forward? And for example, if we look at the Cooper development, although we define Cooper for other purposes, but definitely directly apply to our N1 development. So let's talk about for our LLM or Gen AI roadmap. I think that's where the difficulty is, right? I think it's from the PR point of view, if we want to do this, we need to continue to invest in R&D for new chips and maybe even new software. So from that point of view, I agree with you that we have to look at all the possible scenarios, including a partnership as well as NDA. So some of the NRE payment for us to pay for the current cost. But I think based on the feedback, it's become very clear that LLM is not only for the data center. LLM will penetrate to the H device and our current existing customer and future customer all want LLM as a part of the roadmap. So I think that we need to be flexible to develop a roadmap for our customer and we have to figure that out sometime this year.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thank you for all the thoughts there for me. I guess this is my follow up question where the revenue levels are right now, you guys have been consistent the last couple of quarters that you're working with the customer base to burn through inventory that they had built. And you're clearly under shipping and sell through by a pretty significant margin to do that. So, I mean, I asked this last quarter and maybe it was too early to ask, but now that we've had three more months, do you have a field now as to what the steady straight sell through revenue level of the business is currently just with the designs you've won, particularly in the security camera businesses. What sell through and what the market size right now after we've gone way up and then way down on the inventory correction, what's kind of the steady state sell through that you're under shipping to burn through inventory? You have an estimate for that, thanks.\nFermi Wang: Yes, so we are trying very hard to understand numbers. So let me give you my thoughts. I think, when I look at the number that at peak we shipped probably 92 million a quarter, at the bottom we ship roughly 50 million. And when we look at all of the statistics and the numbers that the model we built, we feel the midpoint of that two number is probably the comfortable level for us. And we are definitely working hard to go to that to reach that level. So I think roughly in the $70 million range is probably the number we are shooting for when everything get equal, equalized.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. My first question for me, so you talked about fiscal 2025 you expect to see growth in both auto and IoT. I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more sort of the puts and takes and how you think the year to progress. Obviously, there's still probably some lingering inventory, especially on the auto side. But yes, any more color you can give us as far as the growth you're expecting in both segments this year?\nFermi Wang: You are talking about CV5 or overall?\nTore Svanberg: No, I'm talking about your -- you mentioned you expect both segments to grow this year. So if you could just give us a little more sort of the dynamic.\nFermi Wang: Right. So I think for the -- let's talk about IoT first. I think for IoT, it's pretty clear that with the CV2 product line that we've been growing CV revenue from close to 60% last year. And we believe that the momentum of CV2 family will continue, particularly after the inventory problem is behind us. So I think at that point, I think CV2 family will drive the growth for us. But more importantly, I think in our script, we talk about CV5, what's our ramping. Last year, we did half a million units, and this year, we're probably going to double it. And that will also, if you consider ASP, that could be meaningful growth for us. So I think that's square on the IoT side. On automotive side, I definitely think that, first of all, we’ll continue to announce the CV2 design win in ADAS, in the OMS, CMS, on the electronic mirror, and the recorders. Those continue to be a big portion of our revenue, but also we are announcing some partnership with CV3 early customer that we have started delivering samples and also partnership with NREs. That will definitely play a role in our automotive revenues in there. So I think overall, although that automotive market continues to be weak based on the feedback from the market, but I still believe that we are a small player in the automotive space and we are trying to be a big one throughout the process. Because we're looking at more along the line, our growth with the current design wins. So I think that's how we feel comfortable that automotive will also have growth this year.\nJohn Young: Yes, Tore, from a product point of view in fiscal 25, our AI inference products, it's almost all CV2, will be more than 100% of our growth. That means the video processor business will, which was down substantially, as John mentioned, in fiscal 2024, it dropped about $80 million. That rate of decline in video processors will begin to really taper off in fiscal 2025. Did you have a follow-up, Tore?\nTore Svanberg: Yes, that was very helpful. As my follow-up, I was pretty impressed with the new Cooper development platform when I saw your samples at CES. And I was just wondering how that development platform is helping you secure more business activity? Because it does seem like it was an important piece of the pie that was missing, but obviously now that you have it readily available.\nFermi Wang: In fact, all our existing customers are eager to get their hands on Cooper. Tells me a lot about how much they like this development because now it's become very easy for them to port software to different umbrella platforms, different silicon means. And also it's easy to transfer the software and the functional AI algorithm from chip to chip. So this whole development is important not only for us, but also for our customers. And I think for the existing customer, that will make their development work even more comfortable and faster. So it will help us to keep those customers, but also for the new customer, even in the LLM part, I think that we can provide an environment for customers to quickly convert their software algorithm to run on our chip. It's important for our designers.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for -- asking the question. When I think about the ASPs that you mentioned, going from CV2 to CV5 or even backwards looking to the CV2 itself, can you just walk us through again, kind of orders of magnitude or pricing ranges, how much for ASPs a tailwind in calendar year 2024 and what do you expect them to be in calendar 2025?\nFermi Wang: Right. So first of all, right. So for CV2 family, I think we talk about the price can be anywhere from the high single digit to the probably $30 range. And that's the average ASP probably high teens. That's a CV2 family. And CV5, we're talking about anywhere from the low 30s to high 40s in that range. And that's, and with our run rate, we think that we can maintain very healthy, not only ASP but also cost margin in that product line. Then CV5, in fact we have CV72 that we mentioned. The price range is similar to CV5, but for AIoT, it's a different part of the line. So I think, and then we talk about CV3, the ASPs anywhere from the $40 to $400 from CV72 to a CV3, 685. So that just gives you an idea of ASP changes.\nRoss Seymore: Great. Thanks for that detail for me. And then I guess you talked about the year and growing in both sides of the business. Obviously we have the first quarter guidance and talked about a little bit of the trajectory in a prior question on both your two sides of your business. But if we think about the kind of the second half versus the first half, it seems like you need some relatively sizable sequential increases on a percentage basis to get to that sort of number. Do you think you will be well within those kind of those average of roughly 70 million true sell through numbers? And if so, is that kind of a second half dynamic? And I guess, is that more just about shipping to demand? So the inventory headwinds debate, or is it about new products ramping?\nFermi Wang: Right. First of all, we didn't guide any quarter to be 70 million in our guidance. We talk about, we believe that we're going to have growth this year and also believe that our Q1 guidance. But overall, I think when I look at the number that Street's predicting, I think it's reasonable. And also that based on what we have seen with our customer demands and as well as our booking, I feel comfortable with the current Q1, Q2 guidance. Of course, Q3, Q4, we haven't seen enough booking, but however the momentum is there. So I think I'm comfortable that we're going to grow. But in terms of our quarter-to-quarter growth, we haven't provided any guidance on that yet.\nJohn Young: Yes, and Ross, just to follow up on the ASP question, our ASP in fiscal 2024 grew about 15% year-over-year. And looking into the next year, it really depends on the mix of video processor versus CV, but even within the CV2 family, the ratio of CV5s to some of the lower end CV2s, then of course we won't have CV3 revenue contributing in fiscal 2025. So should be some increase, but it's just hard to say how much now. Lydia, we can move on to the next question.\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question coming from the line out, Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nKevin Cassidy: Yes, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results. Just on your N1, as you're talking to customers about it, what is the competitive landscape What are some of the alternative designs that they're looking at? And is the GPU still being considered even as an edge processor?\nFermi Wang: Well, some low-end GPU being considered, but as an edge processor, you really need an SoC with very low power consumption. And with that, GPU is much less considered. But however, I do believe that Qualcomm definitely have an ambition to come to this market. And when we compare to them, just like when we compare to them in the automotive space, I think we can deliver higher performance at low power consumption. That's consistent to be the case. So I do believe we are looking at very similar competitors like our automotive market.\nKevin Cassidy: Great. Thanks. And it seems to me you're getting a lot of leverage out of the 5-nanometer process. You've got lots of parts, price performance ranges with this 5-nanometer. Is there anything in your roadmap looking to go below 5-nanometer now?\nFermi Wang: Yes, we have to. I think there's no chance we'll stay at 5-nanometer for long. But however, I think it's really driven by two things. One is whether we can justify the cost and also whether the performance requirement. But I definitely believe that you'll start hearing us talk about next generation of process selections in the near future.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question coming from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Fermi, you had alluded to some OEM wins for CV5 that start to ramp in the second half of the year. Can you talk about what applications you're addressing there?\nFermi Wang: It's an EV truck in western space. And we definitely have been working on this case for several years. And the customer doesn't allow us to talk about it just yet. But I think that since they are close to announce their product, and I feel that we should, we feel comfortable to share with this news, but not to mention the customer names.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you for that. And then I guess as far as the N1 product goes, you guys have kind of always shied away from doing anything in a phone because you don't want to become a feature in a chipset. But obviously a lot of the potential large language model inference could be in devices like phones. So can you just talk about are there opportunities around that to do co-processors or where do you kind of draw the line at your participation?\nFermi Wang: Since both Qualcomm and MediaTek are very eager to come in to introducing products in the phone space for LLM, I feel that our opportunity is limited. Because my idea is that even LLM on the phone, because you have 5G connectivity, you might be able to use some LLM at edge but still leverage the 5G so you can connect to the cloud to run most of the LLM functions on the server side. So with that, cell phone become a limited opportunity for us, not only because Qualcomm MediaTek has an advantage in terms of a market share there, but also the usage model is really not purely age, it's a combination of age and the cloud. So my feeling is we are going to look at pure age devices that focusing on the battery sensitive and also the latency sensitive applications just like what we had before.\nJoe Moore: Great, thank you very much.\nFermi Wang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Dr. Fermi Wang for any closing remarks.\nFermi Wang: And I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I'm looking forward to talk to you in a different conference. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Fermi will now provide a business update for the quarter. Brian will review the financial results and outlook, and then we will be available for your questions. Fermi?\nFermi Wang: Thank you, Louis, and good afternoon, everyone. In a challenging market, our fiscal Q3 revenue was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Our business appears to be in the process of stabilizing as our customers seem to be making progress with their inventory management efforts. We expect our customers to emerge from the cynical downturn at different times throughout the next year. And considering all of the dynamics at this time, we continue to anticipate we will return to growth in fiscal year 2025. We remain determined and focused on our strategic R&D priorities for the introduction of a portfolio of AI SoCs and software, targeting more sophisticated AI inference workloads. Our confidence in the secular growth opportunity for inference AI processors and software remain high. And our long-term serviceable market opportunity CAGR estimate has not changed. Our CV2 family of SoCs is expected to lead us out of a cynical long term and represent a larger proportion of our total revenue in fiscal year 2025. As a reminder, this product family established Ambarella in the AI inference market, and these SoCs are expected to approach 60% of our total revenue in fiscal ‘24. In a single chip, the CV2 products typically provide both video processing and AI inference processing for one or more cameras. The average selling price of this product is close to $20 with a range of below $10 to above $50. In particular, I want to point out that CV5, the flagship of CV2 family and Ambarella first 5-nanometer SoC is forecast to generate meaningful revenue next year with more than 10 customers in production. Our CV3 platform is expected to generate production revenue from the automotive market in calendar year 2026 and beyond. The CV3 platform includes a founding SoC and software, and we began to sample the CV3-AD SoC a year ago. And today, I’m pleased to announce during Q3, we received the first silicon for CV3-685 SoC, the flagship CV3 portfolio. And we are in the midst of a successful up of this extremely sophisticated $10 billion-plus transistor SoC. We expect to deliver engineering samples to customers in Q1 next year, and we are on track due the previously announced award from Continental to the first OEM stock production in calendar year 2027. CV3 SoCs are based on our third-generation AI inference technology and serve significantly more challenging AI inference workload such as a partial or complete autonomy in vehicles. In addition to providing, in a single SoC, the perception processing for multiple camera input, CV3 SoC, for the first time, enables centralized processing of low-radar data as well as deep low-level fusion with data from other sensing modalities. The CV3 family SoC range in price from $50 to more than $400 per SoC. There are two additional elements of our CV3 platform, both of which are software. This includes Oculii Adaptive AI radar perception software and our complete autonomous driving software stack, both optimized for CV3. Since November ‘23, we have been providing thermal rights to OEMs and Tier 1s based on CV3 SoCs and our autonomous driving stack with centralized radar processing, low-level fusion and the Oculii radar perception software. And we will continue to demo this at the CES in January. Now I would like to provide an update on our gen AI plan. During the last quarter, with the implementation of new software building blocks on CV3-8D, we have now successfully demonstrated inference rounding [indiscernible] model with the SoC using LPDDR memory instead of high-bandwidth memory and operating at a fraction of the power consumption of incumbent solutions. Some of our existing customers are evaluating how they will implement gen AI and large language models at the age of their networks. With our successful demos and additional analysis, we have concluded the powerful and highly efficient AI inference processor embedded in our CV3 SoCs is well suited for these markets. We will have more updates on our LLM strategy at CES 2024. Once a year, we update our automotive funnel, which is meant to be a reference for our automotive customer engagements over the next 6 years. We completed the formal update in November and it increased 4% from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. The funnel is comprised of 1 business of about $800 million and a pipeline of about $1.6 billion. With our automotive business expected to generate about $80 million in revenue this year, the $2.4 billion 6-year funnel is an indication of the strong growth we anticipate from the automotive market. There was a significant number of upward and downward revision in the funnel calculation this year, including forecast changes and project delays from both Tier 1s and OEMs, projects won or lost in the pipeline and the addition of new projects. CV3 represents a large portion of the current funnel even though CV3 revenue is not expected to commence until calendar year 2026. I will now discuss represented customer engagement in this quarter. In automotive, we are continuing to win new designs in China, the world’s largest automotive market. The open architecture of CVflow AI SoCs enables leading Chinese Tier 1s and ADAS software providers to develop highly differentiated fully featured solutions. During the quarter, GAC introduced 4 new passenger cars models incorporating Ambarella’s CV22AQ automotive SoCs in intelligent ADAS systems. This included GAC Trumpchi E8 and ES9 and Aion Hyper HT and Aion S Max. Also, Hycan introduced its V09 minivan with ADAS system also based on our CV22AQ. And the SAIC introduced its Maxus Datong 7 minivan, including a camera monitor system, replacing left and the right mirrors and based on our CV22FS functional safety SoC. In the automotive aftermarket, Asia market leader [indiscernible] introduced its QXD DVR based on our CV25 AI SoC and the F200 Pro two-channel DVR based on our A12A SoC. And the European market leader, Nextbase, introduced its IQ Smart Dashcam product line using our CV22 automotive SoC, featuring 4K resolution and advanced AI-based threat detection. In the enterprise security camera market, a number of leading manufacturers introduced new cameras based on our flagship 5-nanometer CV5 and the CV52 families. Motorola introduced its new H6A product line featuring AI-based video analytics and up to 8-megapixel resolution based on our CV52 AI processors. And Japanese market leader, i-PRO announced its new X series featuring total 9-model spending box indoor door and outdoor door models up to 8-megapixel based on CV52 SoCs. And the Korean market leader, [indiscernible] introduced its C-34404 multidirectional outdoor camera based on our CV5 SoCs. Also during the quarter, Verkada introduced CP52-E pan-tilt-zoom camera based on our CV22 SoC, offering camera operators dynamic coverage of wide areas and featuring 5-megapixel resolution and 20x optical zooms. And Germany, IDS introduced its first Ambarella-based camera, the [indiscernible] life imaging analysts based on our CV22 AI SoCs. In the smart home segment, Signify, the Philips Lighting spin-off known for its Hue lighting products, announced its Philips Hue secure cameras. Based on our CV AI SoCs, the cameras can work with Hue lights to control lighting and sound alarms to deter intruders. Also during the quarter, [indiscernible], a leading home automation companies, announced its smart camera based on our CV28 AI SoCs. In November, Insta360 introduced its Ace Pro and Ace Action camera based on our CV5 and the CV52 AI SoCs. The Ace Pro is the first 8K consumer action camera, and both cameras include advanced AI features such as new network-based noise reduction, 48-megapixel computational photography, voice and gesture control and automatic video editing. Collectively, you can see overall design win activity is healthy across 13 different representative customers for 17 different projects, nine in auto and eight in IoT. Furthermore, 16 of the 17 representative engagements utilize our higher-value AI SoCs. You can also see we are successfully implementing more sophisticated AI workload in our SoCs as highlighted with the identification of four different CV5 customer engagements. Looking forward, we believe our newer products such as CV5, CV72, and CV3 are well positioned to support increasingly sophisticated AI inference workloads, and this new product ramp and as we also capture more software value, we believe we can capture more value per design win. Now I would like to give an update on changes to our management team We previously announced in October 18, 2023. Brian, our CFO, will retire from his role as the CFO at the conclusion of the current fiscal year ending January 31, 2024. I would like to thank his contributions to the company, including helping navigate the challenging inventory correction the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing, as well as continuing to strengthen our financial team and position us for success as we continue our transition into larger markets. I’m also pleased to announce that John Young, currently our VP of Finance, will assume the role of CFO on February 1, 2024. John has been with Ambarella for more than 6 years, serving a variety of finance and accounting roles, and we are confident that he will continue to be a valuable contributor as we seek to drive our transformation forward and grow shareholder value. Now I will hand it over to Brian to discuss the Q3 results and outlook in more detail.\nBrian White: Thanks, Fermi. Before I begin, I’d like to thank Fermi and the Board for the opportunity I’ve had to be part of the special team here at Ambarella. The timing of my upcoming transition is facilitated by the progress we’ve made in developing the people, processes and tools to support Ambarella at the next levels of growth and profitability. I have complete confidence in John’s ability to take over as CFO and the team he has to support him. I look forward to their ongoing success. I’ll now review the financial highlights for our third fiscal quarter and provide a financial outlook for our fourth quarter ended January 31, 2024. I’ll be discussing non-GAAP results and ask that you refer to today’s press release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For non-GAAP reporting, we have eliminated stock-based compensation expense along with acquisition-related and restructuring costs adjusted for the impact of taxes. For fiscal Q3, revenue was $50.6 million, slightly above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, down 19% to the prior quarter and down 39% year-over-year. As expected, the sequential decline in revenue was driven primarily by our IoT end market. Non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal Q3 was 62.6%, in-line with our prior guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expense was $44.1 million, down $1.9 million from the prior quarter and below our prior guidance range of $46 million to $49 million, driven by continued expense management and the timing of spending between quarters. We remain on track to our internal product development milestones. Q3 net interest and other income was [Technical Difficulty] and our non-GAAP tax provision was approximately $650,000. We reported a non-GAAP net loss of $11 million or $0.28 loss per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.11 better than the implied midpoint of our prior guidance range, driven primarily by lower operating expenses. Now I’ll turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. Fiscal Q3 cash and marketable securities increased $5.8 million to $222.3 million. DSO improved from 45 days in the prior quarter to 42 days, while days of inventory improved from 147 to 145 days, down $4 million from the prior quarter. Cash from operations was $7.9 million and capital expenditures for tangible and intangible assets was $2.4 million. Free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less CapEx, was 11% of revenue for the quarter and 6% on a trailing 12-month basis. We had three logistics and ODM companies represent 10% or more of our revenue in Q3. WT Microelectronics, a fulfillment partner in Taiwan, that ships to multiple customers in Asia, came in at 54% of revenue. Ciccone and ODM who manufactures for multiple IoT customers was 12% of revenue, and Hakuto, a logistics partner who primarily supplies multiple automotive customers in Japan was also 12% of revenue. Now I’ll discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter fiscal year 2024. The near-term revenue outlook appears to be stabilizing. While customers continue to manage their inventory levels and some pockets of end demand softness persist, ordering patterns and customer feedback suggests that our revenue is leveling out and likely to resume growth in our next fiscal year. For fiscal Q4, we estimate that our total revenue will be in the range of $50 million to $53 million, with IoT up slightly and automotive about flat. At this time, we anticipate the sequential revenue growth will continue in our fiscal Q1 in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. We expect fiscal Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63%. We expect non-GAAP OpEx in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $45 million to $48 million, with the increase compared to Q3 driven by CES marketing activities, R&D tied to new product development and less favorable foreign exchange impacts. We estimate net interest income to be approximately $1.5 million, our non-GAAP tax expense to be approximately $600,000 and our diluted share count to be approximately 40.4 million shares. Ambarella will be participating in a fireside chat and hosting one-on-one group meetings on December 5 and 6 at NASDAQ’s and Morgan Stanley’s London Conference. We also will be participating in Omero’s CES 101 Conference in Las Vegas on Monday, January 8. We expect to host more than 20 investor groups during our CES 2024 exhibition from January 9 to January 12. Please contact sell-side analysts to make reservations. We will also present and host one-on-one and group meetings at the Needham Conference on January 17 in New York. Please contact us for more details. Thank you for joining our call today. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the adjustments, Fermi, that you discussed to the funnel. You had said that you saw some business kind of coming out, and I know you had a number of businesses there that were probability weighted. What’s happening to that when that happens? Is that because the programs are just moving more slowly? Is it competitive? Is it supply chain? Can you just kind of give us an indication of why there would be those adjustments?\nFermi Wang: Yes. Thank you, Joe. I think let me address that question. In fact, in the script, we talked about four different factors. The first factor is the forecast change from Tier 1 and OEMs. For example, for some of the projects that we have won, the forecast of those projects would reduce particularly in the last several months we start seeing that trend. So that’s the first factor. The second factor is we start seeing project delays. For example, for some of the projects that we have won, the production date is pushing out and also for some projects that we are in an RFQ phase, the decision of those – of the final decision of the award is also got push out. So I think that’s the second factor. But also there are – the third factor is really that we continue to have a new project or RFQ that we’re bidding on, and we have different multiplier, like you said, different confidence level for different projects, and that’s a new project will be done. The last factor is really the project that we won and lost at the end. So if you ask me, I think the first and second factor really negatively impact our funnel number, but the third and fourth – the net effect in the third and fourth probably help us to continue to add numbers into the funnel. So that’s the reason we have this minor increase on the funnel numbers.\nJoe Moore: Great. That’s helpful. Thank you. And there’s still an awful lot of growth over multiple years [indiscernible] 5 years. So how does that profile look versus a year ago? I know you’ve talked about a lot of success in China. Do you see more of a China skew to your numbers in the next – as you start to ramp the advanced CV features?\nFermi Wang: Right. So I think that first of all, this funnel – first of all, on the one portion, this is the first time we start seeing CV3 contribution there. In the pipeline, definitely CV3 continue to getting higher and high percentage of funnel number. One thing I can say that in addition to the first CV3 design win, we announced last 2x ago with Conti, we add extra non-Chinese commercial vehicle design wins with CV3 and in this pipeline. So we definitely continue to make progress on that. And the trigger for those design wins is after we demoed the working CV3-685 chip and also demoed software stack we talk about, our AI software stack that can integrate all from the fusion to the radar as well as all the past planning. So we successfully demoed those things to OEM Tier 1s. Those two factors help us to secure the design wins we just talked about.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel.\nJeremy Kwan: Yes. Good afternoon. This is Jeremy Kwan calling for Tore. I guess first, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the adjustments you made to the funnel. Can you talk about how maybe, on a broad level, how maybe did the overall market in terms of maybe SAR impacted? And how much that may have impacted the slight increase in the funnel? And then I’ve got a follow-up after that.\nFermi Wang: I think the global market definitely impacts two things. One is the forecast of the run-rate of the project [indiscernible]. But also, I think you can read a lot of articles talking about for the Level 2+ or Level 3 cars, a lot of the new project the decision got pushed out because people are having different thoughts about their software stack, what’s the function features and particularly how to compete with China with their aggressive product line. So, I think all of those contribute to the first and second factor I just mentioned.\nJeremy Kwan: Great. And then moving to the AI inference accelerator business that you have successfully demonstrated, are we right to read into it that it sounds like this is something that you are moving forward with? And can you talk about maybe your competitive positioning relative to whether it’s the current incumbents, the number of private companies that are in the space and maybe other large competitors that might start to move in. Can you just talk a little bit about…?\nFermi Wang: Yes. I think you are referring to the ARM. So, I think first of all, this time a little bit different than the last time. Last time, we talked about global, a lot of different applications because we haven’t spent enough time on the marketing side. This time, we are kind of zooming to say while we understand our strength is Edge devices, particularly because we are in the market and we know a lot of customers in there. And we have also done enough demos and also talking to customers to understand our strengths against our competitor, both for large companies, also start-up companies. And our strength is, first of all, we have a working silicon that we can give demo at a very good performance, at very low power consumption. I think that’s the key. The second thing is, for us, it’s not just silicon. In fact, we also have bundled software. We are going to show a development environment that we already introduced our customer, we will publicly introduce to the CES about how we are using a software environment bundled with our current solution that enable Edge device or Edge servers quickly moving to AI model to help Edge applications. So, I think that’s where we are focusing on right now. And it’s not that we don’t want to focus on bigger cloud or hyper – much bigger application is really that I think with our current silicon and our current resources we would like to focus on areas that we know, that we are familiar with, and we want to know that we can win. So, I think that’s where we are sitting on with the current plan. Of course, we are not – we definitely need to build a roadmap. But however, like we said last time, our current commitment to ARM is using our current engineering resource, which is enough to do [indiscernible] system, developing the application, developing software for Edge applications, those are – those applications are using current resources. Had we decided to extend our roadmap or doing other applications, we probably need to talk about different engineering resource, which we haven’t committed to that yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna.\nMatt Myers: Hi guys. This is Matt Myers on for Chris. So, you guys talked about first quarter potentially growing low to mid-single digits. Maybe it’s a little bit slower than we were thinking about. So, I was curious is this more end demand-driven or inventory-driven? And how should we think about inventory dynamics into the April quarter by auto or IoT with an enterprise or consumer in there? And then how are you thinking about the shape of end demand into the first quarter and then through next fiscal year?\nBrian White: Well, I think that the data points that we are looking at in support of the growth we talked about for fiscal Q1 is based on, number one, looking at our bookings and backlog trends, which have absolutely improved. So, our book-to-bill was much better in Q3 than what we have been experiencing for a number of quarters. And as we look at the backlog build into Q1, it’s tracking well above the prior quarter, and it’s supporting the growth range that we talked about. And so when we combine the data from bookings and billings and we compare that to the feedback that we are getting from our customers, as well as the requests that we are getting relative to push-outs versus pull-in of shipments, which have become much more balanced than they have been in the past. That gives us the confidence to talk about the beginning of growth in fiscal Q1 and then growth for the full fiscal ‘25. But certainly, we have ways to go. And so that recovery is certainly helped by the turnaround of the inventory situation. End markets also seem relatively healthy and in support of that growth. But I would say the primary driver at this point is getting to the bottom of that inventory cycle and getting through that excess material at customers.\nMatt Myers: Got it. Thanks Brian. That’s great. And then I also wanted a question on video processors. So, based off if you are talking about CV2 being about 60% of revenue, there is clearly a big drop-off in video processor revenue this year. And if CV2 is going to continue increasing next year, what’s your outlook here, particularly for video processors? And are you still investing a lot in this business or getting new wins here? And how should we just think about this particularly in the next year?\nFermi Wang: Right. So, first of all, I want to point out, although we haven’t really paid down [ph] on a video processing only chips, but video processing technology continued to be a very important part of offering in our AI chip. So CV2, all the CV family chip has a big portion of the AI – sorry, the image processing or video processing technology in there. So, I just want to clarify that. So, the – this year, our CV total revenue approached to 60%. Obviously, it was what I just said and also, if you look at the design win momentum, we have majority of that is CV. So, I think the potential continue to go to the favor of CV. But however, I think the decline of a video processor will slowdown because that we have a big jump reduction in the last 2 years, but we still have a long tail of a video processor chip that sell into different markets, including the enterprise security camera as well as automotive. So, I think that we should expect much less reduction on the video processor and with a very long tail.\nOperator: Thank you. For our next question, which comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities.\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. This quarter, Hokuto, the Japanese auto distributor, came up as a 12% customer at the first time in a year or more. Is there anything happening there or is it just because the overall revenue is down, or is there some new designs happening in Japanese automotive?\nFermi Wang: Well, I think it’s really that if you compare to the previous quarter, our other business dropped quickly. And Japan automotive, usually, they just take at a fixed rate and is starting to change the forecast. So, it’s not particularly anything happening in Japan, but it’s really that outside Japan, the drop is significant.\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Thanks. And just as you are going forward with the consumer, and even as we – consumer surveillance cameras and with large language models being used, is there a time when the input for the consumer will be just their voice, they can program their device? Is that something you are working towards?\nFermi Wang: We are working. Now, just the language, we are working on multi-modality. I think in fact, we think that the ARM for us, for our customers’ application, most important thing is processing text that, also speech as well as image all of them together. That adds the biggest advantage to our customer and also that’s probably one unique function that we can really differentiate against other ARM suppliers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company.\nNeil Young: Hi guys. This is actually Neil Young on for Quinn. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask, so it’s been about a year since you announced the partnerships with Continental and Bosch, when do you believe we will start to hear about design wins from these partnerships?\nFermi Wang: Well, we already announced a design win with Conti. We couldn’t mention the OEM name, but I think we did that. And you should – in fact, I would say that our relationship with Conti continued to improve and we are bidding on projects with OEMs together. In fact, that we cannot announce OEM design win with our customer’s approval. But one thing I can say is that activity with Conti is heavy. And also we continue to believe that the engagement between Conti and us are getting tighter and tighter, both on the hardware design as well as the software design.\nNeil Young: Okay, great. Thanks. And just another follow-up. So, there has been some press reports suggesting that Continental is considering divesting its automotive assets, including its autonomous mobility business. How would a divestiture of this business affect your guys’ partnership? Thanks.\nFermi Wang: Well, yes, we heard similar reports. I think one thing I can say is based on our conversation with Conti, we continue to believe this division that we are working with is – continue to be strategically important for both Ambarella and also Conti. And like I have said and with the close development that we continue to have, we didn’t see any signs of slowdown on the Conti side. So, we continue to believe this relationship is important and also the product that we are working on is continually important for both Ambarella and Conti.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line Martin Yang of Oppenheimer & Company.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just one question, can you maybe comment on the progress for customer design engagement regarding your CV72 products in automotive markets?\nFermi Wang: Yes. CV72 automotive product is designed for Chinese market because it’s not ASO, so that only Chinese – only applicable to the Chinese market. And also last time we talked about, we have multiple Tier 1 design wins, and also, at that time, the last time we talked about multiple – all of the Tier 1s are working on building a demo system to show to OEMs. In fact, one of our Tier 1, just yesterday, demoed live, the broadcast live demo driving a car based on CV72 ECU from the Shanghai Airport to the Downtown Shanghai autonomous driving. So, I think that we continue to make huge progress and we are ready to – in fact, we only start demo to OEMs. And also, like I have said before, I think CV72 position in a very favorable price performance for the middle end of Level 2+ solution in China. And we continue to believe that we have a competitive solution for that particular market. And we are working closely with the Tier 1 to talk to OEMs. Hopefully, we can announce some design wins soon.\nMartin Yang: Thank you, Fermi. A quick follow-up on the CV72 activity, can you maybe remind us on the expected timeframe of design win and shipments?\nFermi Wang: All the projects we are bidding on is production the end of 2025 and the revenue coming from 2026. So, the design win has to be maybe first half of next year and spending 18 months development cycle to get it done.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dr. Fermi Wang for closing remarks. Sir?\nFermi Wang: Thank you and thank you everybody for joining us today. And I am looking forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Our fiscal Q2 revenue was approximately flat sequentially and consistent with our guidance. Our AI business grew sequentially and year-over-year, while our Video Processor business was down sequentially and down about 50% from a year ago. Our blended ASP in Q2 was above $12 and is on track to grow about 20% year-over-year. Thanks to the reach and mix of AI SoCs, highlighting the value of our emerging AI Inference Processor (ph) business. Our mid-to-long-term growth outlook for the AI Inference Processor business remains positive. However, the near-term environment is very challenging for our overall business. Customers are now more aggressively reducing their inventory and we are now seeing some pockets of weak end-market demand, which complicates our customers' ongoing inventory reduction efforts. Given this, we have reduced our second half outlook. We are not expecting a recovery in calendar 2023, but we do anticipate our customers' inventory will normalize by the end of the year and set us up for a return to growth in calendar 2024. We continue to expand our position in the rapidly evolving AI inference processor market. Cumulatively, we have shipped more than 17 million AI inference processors into device and end point for IoT and automotive applications, and we are now expanding our AI inference processor reach into vehicle autonomy. As announced on the last earnings call, we continue to evaluate the AI inference accelerator market opportunity. I will now summarize the status of our three major SoC product families, Video Processors, CV2, and CV3. First, Video Processors are human viewing, I expect it to be about 40% of total revenue this year, down from 55% last year and they typically come in a single-digit ASP. For several years, we've been prioritizing our limited resource on AI technology and products and for this reason we anticipate our video processor revenue to continue to contract. However, the revenue impact from the video processor contraction in fiscal year 2025 is anticipated to be significantly lower than what we are experiencing this year. Second, our CV2 family of SoCs establish Ambarella’s in the AI inference market and this SoC are expected to approach 60% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024, up from 45% last year. This family of AI inference SoC commences and ASP close to $20 and serves computer vision applications for auto and IoT. CV2 remains an important growth market for Ambarella in mid-to-long term. Third, our CV3 family SoC first began to assemble a year ago. Based on our third-generation AI inference technology, this SoC target more challenging AI inference workload such as partial or complete mobile system autonomy. The CV3 family SoC range from $50 to more than $400 per SoC and autonomous driving software stack optimized to run on CV3 can add hundreds of dollars per unit of incremental software value. The AI inference processor embedding our CV3 SoC is a starting point for our evaluation of the Gen AI acceleration market. In the last quarter, we began to port Meta's Llama 2 to the CV3 ADI and we expect to have chatbot demos available later this year. We will provide updates on our continuing evaluation and encourage to see Generative AI opportunities emerging on both the server and the device side of the market. I will now summarize representative customer activity in the quarter. Design activity in the enterprise security camera market remains robust at medium customer worldwide. Motorola introduced its H5A multi-sensor camera based on our CV2 AI SoC. The camera offers up to 360-degree view utilizing through four image sensors with upto 32 mega pixel resolution and AI analytics. Axis, a unit of Canon announced the 2 megapixel M4215 cameras and the 4K M4218 cameras both based on our CV25 AI inference -- SoCs, targeting indoor surveillance applications. Japanese market leader, i-PRO, announced the expansion of its Rapid PTZ X-Series and S Series with 16 new models based on our CV25 and CV22 AI inference processors. DynaColor introduces Smarter Q next-generation multi-directional camera using our CV5 AI processor to support four 5-megapixel sensors. And in South Korea, Hanwha launched three new bi-spectrum AI cameras based on our CV2 AI SoC. These cameras provide 4K video and thermal view simultaneously for the rapid detection and the classification of vehicles or insurers. I will now talk about representative customer activity in Automotive market. In our May 30 earnings call, I mentioned the positive feedback we received at the Shanghai Auto Show for our CV72AQ AI inference processor, a derivative over the CV3 family of SoCs. During Q2, this is a Tier 1 in China and I am pleased to report multiple Tier 1 wins for Level 2+ applications. We expect some of this Tier 1 projects to commence production in the second half of the calendar year 2025. We are pleased to announce our first CV5 win in passenger vehicle. We expect this win to enter production in the next 12 months. In this application, the CV5 will support AI inference processing for multiple cameras. Additionally, in July, GAC Motor in China unveils its hyper GT intelligence coupe, including an L2+ ADAS intelligent driver assistance system based on our CV22AQ. And recently, the Chinese government has a new policy allowing camera monitoring system, CMS to replace conventional left and the right side mirrors. The policy also covers interior rear mirrors with a CMS enabled the models being legal, beginning in July 2023. This CMS system represent a significant opportunity for Ambarella's CV2 family of AI inference processors. During the quarter, BAIC, one of the largest automotive OEMs in China began selling SUVs equipped with the CMS system based on our CV22AQ. In the automotive aftermarket, Toyota introduced its wireless backup camera system for trailers based on our H32AQ video processor. The camera will be an option for Toyota's model year 2024 Sequoia and Tundra trucks. Canopy, the startup resulting from Ford and ADT's 2022 joint venture introduced its first product, the Canopy Pickup Cam based on our CV25 AI inference processor. The camera provides a full HD recording, 180 degree field of view, person detection, and Reach-in detection for the back of a pickup. And in June, action camera maker, Insta360 announced its GO 3 camera, a lightweight, but powerful 2K camera that utilizes our H22 video processor. These representative engagements indicate a healthy pace while continuing customer design activity for AI inference processors. Our investment strategy is aligned with the anticipated market demand for more sophisticated software intensive AI influence applications. In the last three years, thanks to the CV2 family, we have demonstrated the ability to capture more value per win with customer demand migrate to AI from video processors. Looking forward, we believe our newer products such as the CV5, CV72 and CV3 are well-positioned to support the increasingly sophisticated AI inference workload our customers are anticipating. This new product ramp and as we also capture more software value, we anticipate our blended ASP will continue to rise. While actively managing expenses through the current market turmoil, we will continue to drive our strategic R&D investments to fully realize the AI inference market opportunities we have discussed today. With that, Brian will now discuss the Q2 results and outlook in more detail.\nBrian White: Thanks, Fermi. I'll review the financial highlights for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and provide a financial outlook for third quarter ending October 31, 2023. I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and ask that you refer to today's press release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For non-GAAP reporting, we have eliminated stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related costs adjusted for the impact of taxes. For fiscal Q2, revenue was $62.1 million, in line with the midpoint of our prior guidance range, flat to the prior quarter and down 23% year-over-year. Sequentially, IoT revenue was up slightly, while automotive revenue was down slightly. Non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal Q2 was 64.6% at the high end of our prior guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expense was $46 million below our prior guidance range of $48 million to $50 million, driven by continued expense management and the timing of spending between quarters. We remain on track to our internal product development milestones. Q2 net interest and other income was $700,000 and our non-GAAP tax provision was $800,000. We reported a non-GAAP net loss of $6 million or $0.15 loss per diluted share, equal to the prior quarter. Now I'll turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. Fiscal Q2 cash and marketable securities decreased $10.9 million to $216.5 million. DSO was relatively flat at 45 days, while inventory declined from 151 to 147 days, down $6.5 million from the prior quarter. Cash used in operations was $6.8 million and capital expenditures for tangible and intangible assets were $5.4 million. Free cash flow defined as cash from operations less CapEx was minus 20% of revenue for the quarter and positive 4% on a trailing 12 month basis. We had two logistics and ODM companies represent 10% or more of our revenue in Q2. WT Microelectronics, a fulfillment partner in Taiwan that ships to multiple customers in Asia came in at 54% of revenue. Chicony and ODM, who manufactures for multiple IoT customers was 14% of revenue. I'll now discuss the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The near-term revenue outlook is challenging. Customer inventory management actions have accelerated and pockets of end demand softening have appeared. Considering these factors, we estimate that our fiscal Q3 revenue will decline to approximately $50 million plus or minus 4% driven by our IoT end market. At this time, we anticipate that this revenue range could continue into our fiscal Q4 with sequential revenue growth resuming in our fiscal Q1. We expect fiscal Q3 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. We expect non-GAAP OpEx in the third quarter to be in the range of $46 million to $49 million with the increase compared to Q2 driven by higher R&D tied to new product development activities. We estimate net interest income to be approximately $1 million. Our non-GAAP tax expense to be approximately $700,000 and our diluted share count to be approximately 40.1 million shares. Ambarella will be participating in Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6, the Asia Investor Conference on September 12 hosted by NASDAQ, the Morgan Stanley Bank of America future car series on September 28 and the Mobility Conference hosted by UBS on October 2, please contact us for more details. Thank you for joining our call today. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question, please.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. So if you guys could highlight a little bit more pockets of weaker end demand that you're seeing there. And then, maybe you can put this in terms of under-shipment by end market. Last quarter, you talked about as an example, a customer that was under shipping by 30%, has that under shipment changed at that customer, and have new customers joined that kind of level of under shipment as well? Thanks.\nFermi Wang: Right. So first of all, in terms of the pockets of weak end market demand, I think there are two areas, one is on the -- of course, in China, we generally think that the China market is weaker than the other market, but I think more specifically there is our whole IoT business, we do see some weakness and we were expecting some demands for the year-end sales, but we don't see that. So we expect to see -- we are expecting a weaker market in consumer IoT. Those are two areas that cause our allowance. In terms of the, you said that from that particular customer last quarter, we quote about the under shipments. In fact, that customer come back with even further push-out demand and so that our shipment to them will be even lower than the 30% we talked about last quarter. And I don't think there are people adding to the list, but it's just really a lot of customers already on the list and we see a new wave of push-out and cancellation coming to the end of quarter and come to the -- and all the way go into August, that's where we talk about.\nChristopher Rolland: Understood. Perhaps also the revision for next quarter was pretty significant. Can you talk about what kind of backlog coverage you have going into each of these quarters? What kind of visibility you have? What kind of turns you typically need in each of these quarters? And then, just kind of broader picture, I think you guys kind of thought maybe July would be the last of all of this and now looks like the weakness is going to continue through January. I couldn't quite sense it, it didn't -- I don't know was January going to be flat, was it going to be up a little, down a little, any of your thoughts there? And why -- do we have confidence that that is indeed going to be the bottom and will bounce from there? Thank you.\nBrian White: Hey, Chris. This is Brian. In terms of backlog coverage coming into any quarter for the company, we typically come in with the quarter in backlog and don't really rely on turns to make the forecast that we provide and that remains the case. So as we give guidance for Q3, Q3 is covered with backlog. And as we look forward into Q4, you asked about kind of whether that's flat or up or down. In the prepared remarks, we talked about an expectation that our range of revenue in fiscal Q4 will likely remain in a similar range as Q3, and again that's based on additional clarity that we've obtained as we've moved through this cyclical correction. Certainly, we're much farther through that correction at this point. We've seen some new information. We've incorporated that into our current outlooks. We think, it's -- we think we have greater confidence enable to -- in our ability to get our heads around how this is shaping up at this point. We think that there is an opportunity for sequential revenue growth as we move into our fiscal Q1 for '25, but that's what we see at this point in time.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks, Brian. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham and Company. Your question, please.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, Fermi, you mentioned some of the opportunities for the CV72S in China, where I think you mentioned having secured several Level 2+ ADAS wins that ramp, I think you said towards the end of 2025, but just wondering if you could give us any more color, what's the magnitude potentially of the lifetime revenue of those wins? Are they significant or are they sort of smaller projects? And then, I've got a follow-up. Thank you.\nFermi Wang: Right. So, we -- I talked about the several design wins with Chinese Tier 1 for this Level 2+ application and the application is very specific, which is Smart ADAS plus parking for the Chinese market. And we believe this is going to be the next high volume opportunity in China to replace current single camera ADAS market. I think that -- I think the price is right and feature is right and we also have major OEMs looking at and evaluating the product at this point. So I think -- we think this could be as big as current ADAS market given time. Of course, that we are ramping up the revenue in early -- in the second half of 2025. The value will be just ramping up, but I think on that peak, I think it can be a significant value for the Chinese market point of view.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thank you, Fermi. And then second question, it sounds like you guys continue to make progress on the data center or enterprise AI inferencing application, I think you mentioned -- you reported the Meta Llama model to the CV3 chip. Wondering, as you look out kind of what are the next steps to -- for that project, where are you on the software and platform development? And are you still sort of thinking of this is probably an 18 month to 24-month time to revenue, is that the right timeframe to be thinking about potentially for revenue from this opportunity?\nFermi Wang: Yes. So, first of all, we start porting Llama to us as soon as it becomes available and I think we've made great progress on that. We are in the plan to demo this Llama in a chatbot demo to our customer sometime in the coming quarter. And also, I think that we continue to believe that we -- our current CV3 represent now only cost-effective and power-efficient but also performance wise is capable to compete with A100. So from that point of view, we continue to develop, but I think you hit one important task is could continue to build out the softer infrastructure to support customer that's definitely another area we are ramping up the resource. We talk about -- we already carve out resource from the current employee pool to support that effort. But as we move forward, when we start engaging customers and provide customer support, we probably need to increase headcount, but that's a second phase after we start engaging customers with our chatbot demo. In terms of revenue, last quarter we talked about, this is more like a 24-month cycle, I continue to believe as a case.\nQuinn Bolton: Perfect. Thank you, Fermi.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Can you talk about how you're thinking about spending your OpEx at this point close to your revenue? I understand revenues were a temporary low point, just how are you thinking about that sort of the balance between the importance of the revenue pipeline versus that sort of near-term cash burn?\nFermi Wang: So, Joe, I think, well -- I think you'll notice that we are definitely trying to control expense, you can see that our Q2 OpEx came below the guidance and that's the direction we're going to continue to look at, where we can cut and where we can save, but however, we still want to continue to invest on our strategic directions, namely CV3 architecture, as well as for the auto and IoT -- our IoT auto, and ARR (ph), but those are the three big pieces of the investment area. But things before we align, we need to look at whether we have a resource to support it. So while we continue to managing carefully by expense, we do not want to sacrifice our strategic directions.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. And then in terms of the video processing market that you talked about, we've obviously recognized that there was going to be a replacement cycle from video processing to computer vision, but do you think you're losing share in this segment, this sort of legacy markets that aren't moving to CV, is that part of why the numbers are challenged here.\nFermi Wang: I think what I said in the consumer IP can, majority of the product today is really focused on low end and cost competitive solutions and that's where we don't spend a lot of money to invest. As you know, our investment strategy is always focused on the areas where we can continue to demand higher AI performance. And for the consumer IoT side that we have a focus on low-end SoC roadmap definitely hurt us. I think that's where we have the biggest risk in terms of losing market share.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Forgive me for this question, Fermi, but -- maybe I read a little bit too much into sort of the tone of your earnings release and some of your commentary, and with all that -- I mean, Joe asked the question just now about your investments and how you're going to focus on and what I'm trying to get at is maybe one step -- maybe one level abstraction above that is like the focus of the company like changed a lot now. I mean it seems like there's maybe a de-emphasis of your camera business and now a shift toward investments in hardware and probably more software to support inference inclusive of some data center application. So I guess should we be taking some of the tone here over the last tonight and maybe last quarter's call, as well as a big shift in direction of where you and your team are focused. And I guess the second part of the question is, has there been a change at all in the focus of the company on the automotive end market? Changes in expectation of revenue, timing of revenue, investment, et cetera., like I said, maybe you can, if I'm reading things that aren't there certainly tell me, but I think it's an important question to address.\nFermi Wang: Right. First of all, I think we continue to committed to the IoT market. I think that this is, when you say camera, I think you meant IoT market. I think that's one area we need to continue to focus and continue to provide solution. After we think that we have a differentiated technology, as well as a big customer base, we need to continue and we will continue to provide solutions to our customers. So I think that is one area I will never say we take our eyes off the ball. And given that, I think we want to continue to invest on auto, but when you see change in auto strategy, one thing that I would say, what's happening in the last six months is, we believe that the China market will give us earlier and shorter-term revenue and then the other market. We definitely more focus our resources to the Chinese market for the CV72 and CV3, and I think that's an area we believe is -- can give us faster to the revenue, but that doesn't mean we don't focus on our USA, Europe, or other markets that we can get our CV3 design, but obviously, those design will take longer time to go to revenue. So I think it's really a focus on the short-term revenue versus our longer-term opportunities. But I will say for LLM (ph), one thing is it's become very clear even our current market like even security camera, when we talk to our professional security camera customers, they all start thinking about how and what impact their business, how to use LLM (ph) to integrate multiple cameras into the services for the service they provide to their customers. And also that automotive guys also start thinking bigger, bigger transformer model, which kept the performance getting higher and leverage, while we investment in AI model. So I rethink that although that LLM (ph) start with, on the server side, which is definitely an interesting area for us, but just in the last three months, when we started talking to our existing customers, it became very clear that LLM (ph) is also on the roadmap for all our existing customer. So LLM (Ph) became a roadmap for us is not just an opportunity we can choose to invest on that. I hope this clarifies your question.\nMatt Ramsay: No. Thank you, Fermi, for all the color there. I appreciate it. I guess as my follow-up question you mentioned there's going to be different phases of your new investment around inference and LLM, have you guys thought about sizing some of those investment areas, I mean, how -- what number of people or number of dollars that you're shifting internal resources? And then, if it goes well, like, what kind of the magnitude of investment are you guys considering given where the P&L is right now? Thanks.\nFermi Wang: Right now, so for the current phase, we talk about we only carve-out a team that we using our current resources, which is under our payroll already to do that, but obviously, when we start ramping up, we probably need to duplicate a similar size of team to support the LLM. So we're talking about anywhere from 60 to 80 people total to support or limit engagement for the customer like our goal is not going to hold the possible customer that we said last time, we need to prove the concept, and with several customers that really want to have a second source for LLM on the server side. Also several customer in our current customer base that can use LLM for their roadmap, So I think with the size and limit to the scope and we think that we can fund this activity with our P&Ls.\nMatt Ramsay: Got it. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys, Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask a near-term question and then I'll have a follow-up. On the near-term side, I guess there's kind of two parts, so forgive me for that, but for the guide for the third quarter, Fermi or Brian, you mentioned that I think you said the majority of the weakness should be in the IoT side not auto, I just wanted to get some color on that. And then the second part of the first question here is going to be the fiscal year basis, I think Joe kind of asked it earlier, but it looks to me like your non-CV revenues are going to be down about 50% year-over-year, how much of that, if you can guess, do you think is share that's just gone and it's the low-end stuff you mentioned, first is, just a cyclical dynamic of inventory burn and some of that will snap back.\nFermi Wang: Right. So, first of all, I think that for the short-term side, we definitely believe that, it’s -- I think the question is related to…\nBrian White: I think the first part of your question, Ross, was confirmation that the weakness that we see in revenue for fiscal Q3 is driven by the IoT side of the equation and that is correct. We're seeing obviously some significant rebalancing of inventory and orders across our businesses. But in terms of what's driving this leg down in revenue between Q2 and Q3, it appears to essentially be all IoT at this point.\nFermi Wang: Right. On the second part is really whether that video processor side, I think that the video processor side is definitely part of the weakness we talk about in the consumer IP cam side, and so that really depends on the inventory situation, whether they, well -- how fast they can rebound to it, but I don't think we can snap back to the original level. We believe that some of our video processor business will be replaced by our low-end CV chip too. So I think that we talk about next year, our video processor business will continue to go down, but not in the same scale that we sold this year.\nRoss Seymore: And then I guess my follow-up, and forgive me, I guess it's kind of three here kind. If we look at the growth for fiscal year '25, you said the video processors will still go down. What do you think are the key growth drivers in your CV business that we should look forward to either when design wins kick in, and inventories burn, so cyclically or secularly just roughly speaking, what do you see as the biggest tailwind to offset that video processor headwind.\nFermi Wang: So for the for CV side, I definitely believe that both when the inventory burns through as well as our new projects like CV5 and CV72 production will help us to get tailwinds to boost our IoT business. But even on auto side, we believe that new design wins can help us to get more revenue growth for next year. So I think that professional -- from the professional IP Cam side, it's become very clear that we think that our market is still -- we hold our market share very well and as soon as we get the inventory cleaned, we should be able to see a rebound on the current design wins and plus with the CV5 and CV72 design when we talk about that should help.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your question, please.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi. This is Thera (ph) for Tristan Thanks for taking the questions. Just, you touched on the IoT side of the business, but maybe on the auto side, have you seen any step downs in order patterns from automotive OEMs as they take inventory control measures in the past few months, and do you expect any further order reductions before year-end in auto?\nFermi Wang: Right. So we did some small customer that trying to -- that reducing their inventory, but it's not as bad as IoT side. I think most of the time, I think our automotive customers continue to take the parts of the plant. Although we see some weakness but it's not like I said, IoT is really the main problem we're dealing with right now.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay. Great. And then for my follow-up, how different are the potential engagements for CV3 given the long-term nature and software platform cost of developing ADAS solutions versus the traditional segments that you play, including delivery orders?\nFermi Wang: Right. So obviously, the CV3 design win take much longer than our recorder in the past. Recall that in the past, it was like 18 months, even in auto, 18 months design cycles. Here in the outside channel, we're talking about four years. That's the reason we decided to really focus on our CV72 and CV3 opportunity in China first and so that we can address the revenue time to market -- time to revenue was the issue. So for that, we talk about CV72, most likely will have a revenue second half 2025 calendar year. And I even think the CV3, we have a design win with a Tier 1 that we might generate revenue in fiscal -- sorry, calendar year 2026 and that is definitely shorter than any other areas that we're seeing.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question, please.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Fermi just back to sort of the resources and the opportunities and specifically thinking about the CV3, the leverage of the software because, we're talking about auto, right, which is an edge device, but we're also talking about AI accelerators at the core, so just trying to understand how much portability you have with your current investments so that you don't have to go through a completely new investment cycle if you will?\nFermi Wang: Right. So, we don't plan to have a brand new investment cycle. With our current resources, we already build up our software stack in a way, we are ready to demo a brand new software stack that's 100% AI-based very soon. That's what we talk about in the past, right? We talk about that we are working with Conti software stack, but in parallel, we're doing our own software development. With our current resource, with the two acquisitions, both Oculii as well as Parma VisLab. We are at a stage ready to demo our next generation of software stack. So from the development point of view, software side, I think we definitely not only prove that we have enough resources but we finished the work to some extent. So now the issue is with LLM, also we funded our phase -- first phase of LLM investment based on our current resource, and leveraging a lot of investment we're putting into CV3 software already. But for the second phase, we are waiting to see the result of first phase of our engagement with customers, even that ramping up is not going to be a lot more than what we have today. We definitely will be ready to talk to investors when we are talking about ramping up. From that point of view, you can think that even for the silicon side for LLM, like I said, this is going to be our next phase of CV3 roadmap. So we have to build a next-generation roadmap for the silicon side, and this will leverage 100% existing VLSI team (ph). So any new development or new investment cycle for LLM is a software team to support customer. I hope that for clarifies the question.\nTore Svanberg: Yeah. Absolutely. And I also wanted to follow up on, I think it was a previous question about LLM or AI accelerator milestones, so what kind of milestones as investors should we be looking at here? I obviously understand the timing part of it, but what are some of the more specific milestones that we should be keeping an eye on?\nFermi Wang: I think the first important milestone is that we demo -- our chatbot demos to our customers and it will happen sometime in the coming quarter. So I think that's important because with the demo it also shows the performance of how we compete -- compare to our competitors and all those information will become open to our customers. I think that's probably the biggest near-term milestone.\nTore Svanberg: Very helpful. Thank you, Fermi.\nFermi Wang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Rosenblatt. Your question, please.\nKevin Cassidy: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. My question is also along the lines of the software stack, with the CV72 in China, how much of the software stack you developed, is there a component of that and can you sell that software stack too?\nFermi Wang: Yeah. So there are two, I think our strategy -- software strategy inside China and outside are different. Inside China, we're counting on our software partners because to really collect data and trend the data in China is problematic for us. So we are counting on working with our Chinese software partners to deal with CV72. Last quarter, we talked about -- we already identified multiple, our software partners and they are porting aggressively their software to our CV72 platform and ready to demo to OEMs in this quarter. So I think from the China side is pretty -- we know exactly what to do with CV72. With outside China, with CV3, we talked about our collaboration with Conti, but more importantly, we want to demo our own software stack, which we don't plan to bundle 100%, but we definitely think this is important software, important technology that we can help our customer to leverage while we have developed. This software stack will top more next time, but however is really we think one of the very few software stack is 100% AI based, and we can show the performance and the functions that were close to B and C level, and I think this is definitely one thing we need to talk about not only technology but also our business -- our business model, we are ready sometime in the near future.\nBrian White: Yeah, Kevin. I'll just add next week September 5 to 8 Continental will be demonstrating our joint software stack on CV3 at the IAA shown, so public demonstration if anyone's in there to check it out.\nKevin Cassidy: [Technical Difficulty] We'll look for that. And maybe along those lines of demos and your work with Conti, is there any update on how many OEMs you're talking to and any progress at all?\nFermi Wang: We announced -- yeah, we announced one design win last time and at this time, we will continue to engage multiple OEMs with potential collaboration with Conti, but also independent that we also told you OEM directly. So we continue to have engagement -- multiple engagements with OEMs at this point.\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of Suji Desilva from ROTH. Your question, please.\nSuji Desilva: Hi, Fermi. Hi, Brian. So thanks for giving us the mix of revenue for the year, roughly between the products, Video, CV2, CV3. Can you give us a sense of what the mix is currently or kind of when it normalizes between auto and IoT, because it sounds like those two categories having different trends right now and I think it'd be helpful to understand kind of where each of the revenue today and maybe in a year or so when things normalize.\nBrian White: Yeah. Sure, Suji. So if you go back to last year, automotive was about a quarter and IoT was about three quarters, given the relative stability of automotive this year versus IoT which is much more volatile to the downside that mix is looking more like 70% IoT and 30% automotive for the current year. Obviously, we said that the size of our SAM (ph) that pursuing over a multiyear time period is much more lever to automotive where we'd be the inverse of that relationship or long term we would expect automotive to be up 70% and IoT about 30% as we move out several years in the future as we get traction with CV3 and some of the other automotive.\nSuji Desilva: Okay. Thanks, Brian. That's very helpful. And then just trying to reconcile guys, the large pipeline number you've been giving for the last several quarters versus the inventory correction here, is there a timeframe in which some of that pipeline starts to convert meaningfully contribute, I imagine that that process will be independent of the inventory abbreviations (ph) that are happening right now, just correct me if that's wrong, but I heard that's not pushed out or pulled in any way because of what's going on right now. Thanks.\nFermi Wang: So I think that talking about the funnel we talked about, so for the very near term, for example, if you talk about funnel for this year, definitely there is some impact from the inventory, but in general, I don't think there's the current inventory correction should have an impact to the funnel because it's really based on design wins and also that probability ended the value of the design win. So we'll be ready to talk about this number in November this year.\nSuji Desilva: And Fermi, just give us an idea of what years does start to kind of come in the elbow of those, like how many years away that is?\nBrian White: Well, our funnel, Suji, at six years, and given the time it takes to land some of these wins, in particular with CV3 it was back end loaded and definitely in the latter half of those six years.\nSuji Desilva: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you, One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nGary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If I'm not mistaken, there's about 20 customers that really move the needle for your overall business, have you had an opportunity to review those top 20 customers and where they stand with respect to inventory balances, whether healthier or not and to give us a sense [indiscernible] of the 20% sequential revenue decline expected for the third quarter. How many customers you are driving that down or is it isolate in just one or two?\nFermi Wang: I think that in general for IoT all of the top 20 customers are having inventory correction problems, but auto might not be as bad. Some of the auto customers have inventory problems, but our top auto guys -- some of them may not. So if you look at -- if you really separate application looking at IoT, any customer -- any top -- any of our top customers, all of them have inventory problems, maybe at a different degree, yeah.\nGary Mobley: I'm sorry, go ahead, Fermi.\nFermi Wang: I was just saying that maybe they will have different degrees of inventory, but all of them have some significant inventories.\nGary Mobley: Okay. Thank you. So a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your relationships with Bosch and some other China Tier 1 partners for CV3, where do those stand relative to how Continental is moving along?\nFermi Wang: So I think in China, we focused on working with Chinese Tier ones as the first priority, and also with Conti and Bosch. So I think that those are the priorities that we have. And we definitely have continue to have appeal Sung RFQ OEMs through those Tier 1, CV72 because this is really the silica is not ASO policies is SoC solution. This is definitely Chinese Tier 1 play for Porsche and Conti will focus on the CV3 levels a solution to Chinese market right now. And we definitely have a multiple discussion with Bosch and Conti on this.\nGary Mobley: Thanks, Fermi. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dr. Fermi Wang for any further remarks.\nFermi Wang: Thank you everybody for joining us today and looking forward to talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

Fermi will first provide a business update for the quarter, Brian will review the financial results and outlook, and then we will all be available for your questions. Fermi?\nFermi Wang: Thank you, Louis, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. Our Q1 results were slightly ahead of our expectations. Despite the significant headwinds from the ongoing semiconductor industry cyclical downturn, we are not allowing this difficult environment to distract us from further developing our AI business. Before I talk about the details of the quarter, with all the cross currents in the market together with the all the exciting developments in the AI market, I thought this would be a good time to review our strategic vision. Simply put, our transformation into an AI company is well underway, with AI already representing 45% of our total revenue last year and an estimated 60% this year. Now with our CV3 platform, we are expanding into a new phase of AI market development. The AI market is at a very early stage, it is also dynamic with many technologies and applications emerging. With all the excitement about AI, the key to our continued success will be our focus and the degree to which we can leverage our unique core competencies. Even with our focus, our current serviceable available market, or SAM, is sizable, exceeding $4 billion this year and approaching $10 billion in fiscal year 2028. So, what are we focused on? Ambarella is focused on deep learning AI processors and software, which are replacing the legacy and less powerful traditional machine learning approaches. Within the deep learning market, the AI processor market has been dominated by training processors used in servers typically for the cloud, data center or enterprise. Our focus is on AI inference, which is where AI models get deployed and are practically utilized by end users. As the AI market begins to mature, most third-party research firms forecast the size of inference AI to surpass training AI. We have already demonstrated how we can leverage our rich heritage in human perception, also known as video processors, into AI. Our CV2 family was our first move into AI, and it targets inference AI perception processing at the edge where cameras are the principal sensing modality. We continue to expect the CV2 family to be approximately 60% of total revenue in fiscal year '24, and represent a material portion of our operating profit dollars. The CV2 SoC integrates our camera perception expertise with our proprietary second-generation CVflow AI architecture. The incremental processing to enable AI causes our CV2 blended average selling price, ASP, to be greater than two times a video processor. This contributed to an over 20% increase in our firmwide ASP in fiscal year '23. This year, the CV2 family is expected to become the dominant driver of our revenue and remain the key driver for several years. The solid stream of operating profit from video processors and the CV2 family of edge AI processors is now being reinvested into the significantly more powerful CV3 platform targeting mobility applications. The CV3 platform builds upon our CV2 family experience and utilizes our proprietary third-generation AI inference processor. For the typical Level 2 Plus application, the CV3 SoC provides the perception processing for all the camera and radar sensors, as well as the processing required in the fusion and planning layers. The significant amount of incremental processing is expected to facilitate a CV3 SoC ASP to be five to 20 times higher than a CV2 SoC. It is also very important to understand CV3 is a platform, as the SoCs in the CV3 family can capture incremental value by running our own autonomous driving, AD, software stack IP and/or radar perception software IP. We aim to bundle this software IP with our CV3 SoCs in a platform approach, providing our customers with the flexibility to pick and choose exactly what they need. Regarding our Autonomous Mobility partnership with Continental, I am pleased to share that we extended our partnership to Level 4 system development and confirm the first business award of our jointly developed stack as a complete Level 4 Fallback System. The system will be supplied to Continental for a customer in the commercial vehicle industry. To be clear, the CV3 platform is a major leap forward in term of our value proposition and it brings a new list of targeted customers; automotive OEMs. We are still in the early stages of building out the CV3 SoC portfolio and developing the market. However, we are not doing this alone, with leading Tier 1s like Bosch and Continental porting their software to CV3, validating our superior efficiency, jointly marketing to auto OEMs, using their scale and bringing more credibility to our CV3 market development efforts. Additionally, for the AI server inference market, we have already evaluated running large language models, LLM, on CV3-AD High, which has been sampled for nine months, and we believe the LLM performance on this existing SoC to be as good as the Nvidia A100 with much lower power consumption and a superior total system cost. We are now establishing a software development effort as well as a business development program to engage with customers. Turning to new products and customer engagement in the quarter. In March, at the ISC West security show, we announced our CV72S for mainstream enterprise and public class security cameras. CV72 utilizes the same third-generation CVflow deep learning AI accelerator architecture utilized in the CV3 SoCs. This CV3 derivative SoC bring to the IoT market the highest AI performance per watt, the fusion of radar and camera data and it includes support for the latest transformer neural networks. Furthermore, CV72S offers six times the AI performance of CV2 family, enabling it to run Ambarella's groundbreaking neural network-based image signal processing software for 4K color, night vision and HDR with plenty of headroom for additional concurrent neural networks. CV72S is now sampling to leading IoT camera companies. In IoT, there were a number of new enterprise and public security cameras introduced, including: Motorola, who introduced the H6SL camera line based on CV25, as well as the V700 body camera based on our S6LM SoC; and Verkada introduced its TD52 video intercom featuring a five mega-pixel camera based on our CV25; iPro, formerly Panasonic and Japan's largest security camera supplier, introduced multiple new product families based on our CV2, CV22 and CV25, including dual and quad multi-imager models; and European market leader Axis, part of Canon, introduced its 3905 rugged dome models designed for surveillance on board vehicles, such as buses based on our S6LM; also in Europe, Dallmeier introduced Domera E series cameras which use our CV22 AI SoCs to enable imaging in total darkness utilizing adaptive IR illumination; in the home monitoring market, Alarm.com introduced its ADC-780 battery powered doorbell based on our S5LM. I'll now talk about progress in the automotive market. As mentioned earlier, our new CV72S SoC is an important CV3 derivative for the IoT market. However, it is expected to also be an important derivative product for the automotive market, and in April at the Shanghai Auto Show, we announced and demonstrated CV72AQ. This SoC targets multiple automotive applications including Level 2 Plus and other applications with up to six cameras and five radars running on the same SoC. CV72AQ demonstrations at the show included an ADAS plus parking system with a five camera configuration including an eight megapixel front camera and multiple three megapixel fish eye cameras running YOLO v7 neural networks on each camera. We also demonstrated, versus the leading GPU solution, superior performance and lower power consumption of CV72AQ running transformer networks. We received very positive feedback on CV72AQ from Tier 1s and OEMs in China. Also at the Shanghai Auto Show, a number of other Tier 1s demonstrated CV3-based systems. This included Continental which showed a 10-camera live demo with multiple neural networks running on each video stream. And Hyperview demonstrated its GT-HyperMax platform featuring a sensor suite of 11 cameras plus one lidar and three radar in a car, providing City Navigate on Pilot advanced functions and leveraging the latest transformer networks. In March, China's GAC introduced its electric AION Y Younger L2 Plus ADAS SUV with an intelligent 1V1R driving assistance system based on our CV22AQ AI SoC. And in April, Geely Zeekr introduced its Zeekr X electric SUV with a face recognition access control system based on CV28AX AI SoC. In summary, a majority of our new customer engagement activity continues to be for our AI products. AI is expected to be a majority of our revenue, for the first time, in F2024, and AI should continue to grow as a proportion of our mix. To bring our AI strategic vision together, first with CV2 and now again with the even more significant CV3 platform, we have leveraged our core competencies, cumulative knowledge and unique approach to establish a strong presence in the AI deep learning domain. Our investments yield differentiated products that are very different -- very efficient, and on open platforms that are scalable and flexible. The CV2 family is already very profitable and we are well into the development phase with the CV3 platform. In summary, there is still a lot of work left to execute to our strategy and the ongoing semiconductor industry cyclical downturn pressures our near-term financials. However, we are confident in the long-term secular growth opportunity for edge inference AI, we do not intend to stray from our strategic vision, and we are continuing to invest in our differentiated AI strategy. I will now turn it over to Brian to discuss the Q1 results and the Q2 outlook in more detail.\nBrian White: Thanks, Fermi. I'll review the financial highlights for the first quarter fiscal year 2024. I'll also provide a financial outlook for our second quarter ending July 31, 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results and ask that you refer to today's press release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For non-GAAP reporting, we have eliminated stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related costs, adjusted for the impact of taxes. For fiscal Q1, revenue was $62.1 million, in line with the mid-point of our prior guidance range, down 25% from the prior quarter and down 31% year-over-year. As expected, total Automotive revenue was approximately flat sequentially, while IoT revenue was down sharply driven by customer inventory reduction actions. Non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal Q1 was 63.1%, in line with the mid-point of our prior guidance range of 62% to 64%. Non-GAAP operating expense for the first quarter was $46.2 million, up $200,000 from the prior quarter and below our prior guidance range of $47 million to $49 million. The lower operating expense was driven by continued expense management and the timing of spending between quarters. We remain on track to our internal product development milestones. Q1 net interest and other income was $1.3 million. This was higher than our original forecast driven by a higher cash balance and returns on cash invested. Our non-GAAP tax provision was $300,000, or minus 5.5% of pre-tax income. This was slightly lower than our original forecast, driven by the mix of pre-tax income across tax jurisdictions. We reported a non-GAAP net loss of $6 million or a $0.15 loss per diluted share. Now, I'll turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. Fiscal Q1 cash and marketable securities increased $20.5 million to $227.4 million. DSO improved significantly from 57 days to 43 days as the timing of shipments throughout the quarter normalized, after being back-end loaded in the prior quarter. Ending inventory increased slightly, up 1.8%. However, days of inventory increased more significantly, from 116 to 151, due to the sequential reduction in cost of goods sold on lower revenue. Cash from operations was strong at $22 million, driven by the decrease in accounts receivable, and capital expenditures for tangible and intangible assets were $2.3 million. Free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less CapEx, was 31.7% of revenue for the quarter and 6.4% on a trailing 12-month basis. We had two logistics and ODM companies represent 10% or more of our revenue in Q1. WT Microelectronics, a fulfillment partner in Taiwan that ships to multiple customers in Asia, came in at 49% of revenue. Chicony, an ODM who manufactures for multiple IoT customers, was 16% of revenue. I will now discuss the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024: Customer feedback on end-demand remains generally healthy. However, at the same time, customers also continue to aggressively manage down their inventory levels. Considering these factors, we estimate that our fiscal Q2 revenue will be flat to Q1 and in the same range of $60 million to $64 million that we guided for the prior quarter. By end market, we expect that both automotive and IoT revenue will be approximately flat sequentially as well. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% to 64.5%, up slightly from Q1. We expect non-GAAP OpEx in the second quarter to be in the range of $48 million to $50 million, with the increase compared to Q1 driven by higher R&D tied to new product development activities. We estimate net interest income to be approximately $1 million, our non-GAAP tax expense to be approximately $700,000, and our diluted share count to be approximately 39.7 million shares. Ambarella will be participating in TD Cowen's Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on May 31st and June 1st, Bank of America's Global Technology Conference on June 6th and Rosenblatt's Age of AI conference on June 7th. Please contact us for more details. Thank you for joining our call today. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nGary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about inventory drawdown with customers. You mentioned that customer and demand appears to be healthy, but obviously, your [undershipping in] (ph) demand. Could you give us a sense of by how much and -- by how much or how close we are to inventories being back down to a normal level? And then, maybe you can comment as well specific to China-related demand?\nFermi Wang: Yes, this is Fermi. I think like Brian said, we haven't seen a huge change from the customer side. For example, last quarter, we talked about customer that has healthy growth based on our silicon, but our silicon revenue from them is strong 15%, 20% year-over-year. And that situation continues. And I think the customer continue to confirm that their growth and we continue to forecast lower revenue this year. So, I think from that point of view, I think the situation is very similar to last quarter and we have not seen anything -- any indication that this inventory correction will end. So, I think what we are looking for is really that the ramping up of new orders consistently from different customers, that will probably give us indication that it's recovered. We haven't seen that yet.\nGary Mobley: And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your win that you captured in conjunction with Continental. Is that automotive-grade win? And maybe if you can give us a sense of where automotive -- other automotive-grade wins may stand?\nFermi Wang: Right. So that's automotive-grade win. And like I said, it's a Level 4 car and it's going to be auto-grade chip. And it's going to be -- its first design win that we work with -- after the announcement, working with Continental. And in this design, we involve not only our CV3 SoC, but also our software IP, the software stack that we -- Continental and us are co-developing. So, I think it's combination of software and SoC win. If we do -- we are working on other design wins. For example, we talk about, first of all, we'll continue to work with Tier 1s like Conti and Bosch on any potential design wins. At the same time, we also mentioned that in China, I think we start seeing that a lot of opportunity in Level 2 Plus cars, especially at the Shanghai Auto Show, we introduced CV72AQ. It make us believe that we have plenty of opportunity there and we are optimistic that we're going to close on design win this year there. And also, the time to revenue is much faster with those potential design win in China.\nGary Mobley: Thanks, Fermi.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Fermi, you mentioned that you haven't seen any signs of end of the inventory digestion that's going on and that growth would really resume when some of the new products kick in. Can you, I guess, dive a little bit deeper into that? And so, the two-part question would be, where do you believe the revenue level would be for your company versus the $60 million to $64 million if you are shipping to true-end demand? And to the extent it's dependent upon new products kicking in, when do you believe that occurs?\nFermi Wang: Right. So, first of all, I think that we are now waiting for new product to kick in. We believe the current inventory correction, when they finish, the existing product line will come back to live and it will go back to original level. So, we are now counting on new product design win to fix this inventory correction problem. And for your first question in terms of level, last quarter, when we look at just one example of a customer, we think that we're probably like a 25%, 30% below the realistic level. So, I think we still hope believe that's a level the differences we're looking at. And hopefully, when the inventory correction finished and all the customers went back to normal, I think that should give you indication where we think the normal level of revenue is.\nRoss Seymore: Got it. And I guess for my follow-up on the automotive side specifically, it's good to see the design win with Conti turned into products, et cetera. That business has been basically flat sequentially, I think, for four quarters now; three quarters you've reported and it looks like you're guiding it relatively flat. When is the timing where we should start to see that business picking up? You guys have talked about this investment. I know it's a longer-term strategy for the company, but it seems like one that should yield some pretty strong tailwinds off the size of company you're currently running at. So, just wondered on the timing that we should look for and what the drivers of that growth should be.\nFermi Wang: Well, I definitely think that's flat. If you look at few quarters before the inventory correction and now you're comparing to the inventory corrections period. So, I think the last two quarters definitely been impacted by inventory correction in the automotive sector. So, I also believe that as soon as inventory correction finish, auto should show some revenue growth from that point of view. But like you said, the really big auto growth should come with the ADAS market and also at Level 2 Plus market when they go into production.\nRoss Seymore: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Guerra from Baird. Your question, please.\nTristan Guerra: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to have a follow-up on the inventory correction and also try to tie this with market share shift. So, it's no secret that some Chinese companies have tried to diversify away from U.S. supply, either because there is push from that -- for that -- from the Chinese government or because they're concerned about potential future sanctions. And I know you very much derisked your surveillance camera exposure to China in the past, but you still have exposure in automotive. So, I wanted to know if there is any signs that perhaps the ramp in China is not expected at the pace that you thought will happen a year ago? Are you getting any feedback? And also just to the extent that the inventory correction that you're describing seems to be a bit more pronounced than some of the other companies where it's been really more smartphone and PC centric for other companies. So, any elaboration around that would be great.\nFermi Wang: Right. So, in terms of the geopolitical situation, I think for automotive market, it's much less severe than security, right? Security is really being viewed as the safety of the country so that -- that's why I think people trying to avoid U.S. components. But in automotive, in fact, if you look at the middle and high end auto components in Chinese market today, all of them are U.S. components. So, I think that's because in automotive processing, I think that our solution among other U.S. components still have better performance efficiency and we haven't seen a similar impact on Chinese government on mandating the Chinese automotive OEM use exclusively the Chinese component. So, I think that the two things add together, I think, I still believe that we won't see a severe downturn on the Chinese automotive business.\nTristan Guerra: Okay, great. And then, as my follow-up question. Obviously, you've made that software acquisition, you have the sensor fusion chip. So, do you think you have all the pieces you need to move into L2 Plus and L3 application? Are you getting any feedback about customers looking at your company size versus, say, larger supplier, or is it purely based on chip performance where obviously you excel? Is there any other consideration that -- and how you -- in terms of getting design wins and how you'll address that? And that question will also tie to the product roadmap and whether customers are kind of wondering where will you be five years out in terms of product roadmap?\nFermi Wang: Right. So, I think, from a product roadmap point of view, I think for Level 2 Plus, Level 3 car, I think we have all the contents that we need to go after this market. Because from the hardware and software point of view, I think we can offer a complete solution. But from the strategy point of view, as we said before, we are not bundling hardware and software together. We are trying to offer a software platform that customer can pick and choose and we can help our customer to build their own software stack and working with Conti is probably the best example. And in terms of scale, it's always a problem, right? Trying to compete with a bigger company is always a disadvantage for us. But I think that's the reason we continue to try to work with a bigger Tier 1s. And using -- with their scale and expertise, that will help us partially further to address this problem.\nTristan Guerra: Great. And clearly, the Conti and Bosch design win speak to that effect. Thank you very much. Very useful.\nFermi Wang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question, please.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. My first question, Fermi, could you just talk a little bit about the main difference between the CV3-AD and the CV3-AQ? Whether it's functionality or ASPs or any other color you can share with us?\nFermi Wang: Right. So, CV3-AD and CV72AQ, first of all, they are all based on the same architecture, CV3 architecture. All of them using the third-generation AI inference -- AI processor. The difference -- main difference in the CV3-AD is designed for the auto-grade chip level [ASIL] (ph), and CV72AQ is designed for the system-level auto grade. So, I think that's a main difference. So, I think the -- for example, CV72AQ platform is target for Chinese market where people willing to accept system-level ASIL system versus chip-level ASIL system. That's the main difference.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. Thanks for clarifying that. And my follow-up question, you announced the design win for the software IP modules. Again, I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on that. And it's surprising to me when I hear software IP module, right, because I think hardware and software. So, it's like how exactly is the accounting for this particular design?\nFermi Wang: So, interesting -- I think I see as we announced this is software partner with Conti, so basically the idea is that we are contributing a portion of software solution and we work with the Conti software team to integrate those modules into a complete software stack, leveraging the strength of both sides. For example, Ambarella's more -- strength is on the perception side, particularly today is video perception and radar perception, but Conti definitely has a lot more system-level solution and famous for their auto-grade system software. So, I think that's where we see that we can leverage both sides of our strength and build a software stack based on leveraging the both side of strength. So I think that's an approach that we're different than the customer. And also for OEMs that if there are anybody who want to do similar business model, we are open to that too.\nTore Svanberg: And on the sort of revenue accounting for -- I mean is this a module sale or IP revenue?\nFermi Wang: Yes, I see. That's basically a software revenue split. We need to decide how to share the software revenue together.\nTore Svanberg: Understood. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Rosenblatt Securities. Your question, please.\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a similar question to what Tristan had about automotive, but in the AI server, as you move to the adjacent market, AI server inference, and you said you have about the same performance as NVIDIA A100, but much less power. Can you say like you have all the tools you need to move into the server market or into the cloud inference market?\nFermi Wang: Right. So, obviously, the similarity between our current automotive market and the new AI server market is, they are really running a new network on our chip. So, from tools point of view, that we always develop many, many software to help our customer to port a neural network onto our chip. But obviously, LLM is different beast, because they are much larger than the typical neural network that we are working with. So, definitely there is optimization cycle needs to work on. But the reason we decide and we think we have a great opportunity here is, first of all, we have a working silicon in demo; two, we have a bunch of expertise and the software tools available that we build for other market; three, we just need to fine tune and optimize the current software for this LLM to achieve the best possible performance that we can get. So, I think from that point of view, the effort for us is well -- is limited and also I think that we also believe that in the market, very few people can claim what I just said that we have a working silicon, can show real performance and real low power consumption and also demo to the customer. So, I think that's our advantage. And also believe that the extra resource we need to put on is something that we can handle.\nKevin Cassidy: Great. And what would be the go-to-market strategy? Are you looking for a few maybe flagship customers to lead the way, or are you going broad with lots of different customers?\nFermi Wang: No, I think we have to be focused. I think we need to identify the sweet spot. I think, we should talk about strategy later because we are in the process of talking to customers, but I think we need to focus on where our strength and also focusing on companies that has -- can leverage our chip and our software immediately. And so -- I think that one thing we learned is to work with a customer who has really -- they feel the most painful experience with current solution who are most likely to work with us and that's where we're going to focus on.\nKevin Cassidy: Okay, great. Very interesting.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. Your question, please.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Fermi and Brian, maybe just your best guess. I mean, we've been working down this inventory now for a few quarters. Certainly doesn't sound like it's -- you haven't seen any green shoots yet in terms of the orders. What's your best guess as to how many more quarters you think it will take to work down this inventory? Do you think we'll be pretty clear by the end of your fiscal year or the end of the calendar year? Do you think it could take longer?\nBrian White: Yes, Quinn, this is Brian. A quarter ago, we said that our guidance for fiscal Q1, which was $62 million at the midpoint. We thought that, that would represent the bottom as it related to impacts associated with inventory adjustments and then it would likely not get worse from that point. And we're kind of sitting in the same place we were 90 days ago from the standpoint that we still believe that's the case. What becomes challenging is forecasting when this thing lifts off again and at what slope. We certainly have visibility to backlog. But that backlog has been shifting, right? We've had re-schedules, cancellations that we've had to deal with. So, while in normal times, we can look at that backlog and have a lot of confidence as to how revenue might shape up, say, in fiscal Q3. Because of the movements that we've seen, our confidence in providing a forecast would be lower in this cycle than kind of a normal time. So, we don't see it getting worse, but the visibility to the second half and just how that recovery plays out, I think it's hard for us to talk to at this point.\nQuinn Bolton: I understand you're not guiding to the fiscal second half. Historically, you've seen some stronger seasonal trends in the second half. I mean, can you just provide any framework how we might be thinking about it? If the inventory doesn't get any worse and you see normal seasonality, that would imply a lift? Obviously, if you start to see the inventory correction and that would imply a lift? I mean, are you sort of suggesting, \"Hey, keep it in the $60 million to $64 million range until you see inventory clear,\" or do you think you can see some seasonal upticks in the second half?\nBrian White: Well, normally, we would see some uptick in the fiscal third quarter in particular. And we would hope that we do again. But we're just at a point where we don't have the visibility and the confidence to put a number out there and try to give you some magnitude of directional increase at this point in time.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Understood. Thanks, Brian. And then, I guess, for Fermi, I guess, I was a little surprised to see your first win with Continental being a Level 4 win. I think the initial partnership you'd announced back late last year, I think was for Level 2 Plus. And so, can you just sort of maybe talk about how the Level 4 win came together? I know you had expanded the relationship with CES and so maybe that was on the fast track. But when -- were you surprised that the Level 4 came before Level 2 Plus with Continental?\nFermi Wang: Well, I think that the engagement definitely after we announced this software collaboration between Conti and us, which happened at CES, and things goes really fast after that. So, I think definitely, I'm also surprised how fast this developed. And also -- and I need to thank Conti that putting this whole thing together because the one important thing is that to sell that joint software stack and get a confidence with customer is important for us, and I think that's a great win for us. But at the same time, I want to say again on a Level 2 Plus, I think that with -- we look at two things. One is the momentum with the Conti and Bosch still -- that we're still working on and still there. But more importantly, I rethink now with Shanghai Auto Show and with our CV72AQ announcement, and the sampling the component and the software to a customer recently, that gives a confidence that we're going to see CV72AQ Level 2 Plus design win this year and maybe quick revenue returns. And in China, you know that the design cycle is not four years; usually, it's less than two years. So, we are hopeful to see a really quick revenue return from the CV72AQ. And also that we have a roadmap continue to address this market. So, I think -- overall I think Level 2 Plus design win is -- will continue to be our focus and we think we'll continue to deliver what we think that we can do.\nQuinn Bolton: Perfect. Thank you, Fermi.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur from Imperial Capital. Your question, please.\nBrian Ruttenbur: Yes, thank you. Can you give me, first of all, housekeeping D&A and material [depreciation and] (ph) amortization?\nBrian White: Depreciation and amortization, is that the question?\nBrian Ruttenbur: Yes, that's affirmative.\nBrian White: Yes. For fiscal Q1, I believe it was $5.8 million.\nBrian Ruttenbur: Okay. $5.8 million for the first quarter. Also, in terms of DSOs, do you anticipate DSOs stabilizing here? So in other words, trying to understand your cash situation probably will just go down, you probably won't have stair step event again, or do you anticipate DSOs continuing to go down?\nBrian White: No. I mean, what we saw in fiscal Q1 was a normalization of the timing of shipments throughout the quarter versus, say, fiscal Q4, where shipments were very back-end loaded. So, we had a couple of quarters; fiscal Q3, Q4 were both very back-end loaded quarters. Q1, normalized, DSOs came down. That provided about a $22 million benefit to cash flow in the quarter. As we move forward, we would expect DSOs to remain at similar levels. Thus, we would not expect to get a large benefit in a future quarter from another stair step down, for example. So, as we move into Q2, obviously, at the revenue level and the other metrics that we gave you, that would be a forecast for a non-GAAP loss. And so, you'll have lower free cash flow in fiscal Q2 versus Q1. And as we go through the year, cash flow is just going to be highly dependent upon the revenue levels. We've talked about the fact that we just -- we don't have great visibility at this point in time to the second half revenue.\nBrian Ruttenbur: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Suji DeSilva from ROTH Capital. Your question, please.\nSuji DeSilva: Hi, Fermi. Hi, Brian. Good to see the Continental win. I don't know if I missed this, but did you say the L4 commercial vehicle customer, what geography that was?\nFermi Wang: We didn't. And we -- our customer doesn't want us to disclose that yet.\nSuji DeSilva: Okay. Fair enough. And then, I think when we talked about a range of ASPs, five to 20 times, can you just talk about what drives the delta there? Is that more compute hodge -- horsepower in the chip, or is that compute plus software? Any color there would be helpful.\nFermi Wang: I think that comment is purely for silicon, not -- does not include software. So, the difference is really from the low end to the high end. So, for example, the lower end -- for the high-end chip, we talk about $400 plus. And the lower end, for example, our 655 chips that we're talking about are probably in the $100 range. So it's really that level of the different performance of price range that we're talking about. I also believe that for automotive roadmap, you need to have a family of chip to address different performance level for Level 4, Level 3, Level 2 Plus. Even multiple layers of Level 2 Plus require different ships. So, I think that's what we're actually talking about.\nSuji DeSilva: Okay. Thanks, Fermi.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of David O'Connor from BNP Paribas. Your question, please.\nDavid O'Connor: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question guys. Maybe Fermi, just going back to the question on the AI inference opportunity. Can you just give us a bit more detail there on what type of customers are potentially kind of you could engage with on the AI inference side? Is that [data price] (ph) or enterprise, or any particular vertical that you think may be open to you? And I know it's early days, but as you mentioned, you have a working chip and you need to rework the software, but what kind of timeframe do you think you could potentially get to revenue there? Is that kind of three to five years now? Is it kind of before that? And anything around kind of content opportunity there would be helpful. Thank you.\nFermi Wang: Yes. So, it's a lot of question. So, I think like I said, the target market is really where is -- I think our first target is really on the edge server side, which -- where you can focus on the enterprise and the people who are running their own neural network. For people running open AI or other very large model, that might not be the best customer at this point for us. But there are plenty of other different software [SVs] (ph) and that use -- driving different neural net model either for the own code or they are running the enterprise level. Those are the probably sweet spot for our chip because we know that, just like I said, the scale is -- definitely matters in this market too, and we need to pick the best market we go after. And we are still in the process to figure out, but I definitely think that's, what I just said, it's along our current thinking. But I think in terms of the content, I think is obviously even better than our automotive ASPs, because the competition out there is starting at a much higher level. And also, we have great advantage on both. On the power consumption side, we are not talking about 5%, 10%, we're talking about significant difference in terms of power consumption, therefore -- as well as the total system cost. So, I think from that point of view, it will help us to get a healthy content there. I think there is another question, I forgot.\nBrian White: Time to revenue.\nFermi Wang: Time to revenue. So, we -- I think we need to get [indiscernible] running, then our software too running, so that a customer can port, and then we can talk about design win, then we talk about revenue. So, I think if you ask me today, I would say that's a 24-month process totally. That's a wild guess, yes.\nDavid O'Connor: It's quite helpful to frame that. Thank you, Fermi. And maybe just a follow-up on that for Brian. Just on the ramping that software development team, just to clarify, that fits in with the current OpEx envelope? Are we going to see some kind of step up there to fund that new team? Thank you.\nFermi Wang: Yes, our plan is to use our current expertise and team to facilitate this activity. The idea is simple because we have -- our internal team is -- has helping many other customers to port their neural network onto CV3. And we understand [LLM] (ph), because it's so large and it takes an extra effort, so that -- the best way to do this is fund it and put internal resource on this project. Obviously, it will take a trade-off, right? We don't plan to add much of the resource into the company, so I think that we need to really focus on the area where we think it's important. I think it's very important for us is definitely security camera to provide cash for us, maintaining our CV3 momentum with the current design wins like Bosch and Conti, and try to secure a CV3 design win with OEMs and also try to find a resource to fund this LLM, and everything else is a trade-off that we need to consider.\nDavid O'Connor: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. Just first, on the cash side. Just curious, I know you mentioned talking about increased R&D investments over the next few quarters. Just with -- at your current cash flow, are you comfortable there? Or do you see any need to raise incremental cash in the future?\nBrian White: No, we don't see any need to raise incremental cash. We have a strong cash balance, no debt, and we've got a history of being positive from a free cash flow perspective. So, no need to raise additional cash.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then quickly as a follow up. Just given the current revenue levels, we've seen a relatively substantial [indiscernible] kind of split between IoT and auto is now roughly 65%, 35%. Gross margins are still kind of held up relatively okay and above this the long-term range of 59% to 62%. So, just kind of curious if you can give us the puts and takes on to the gross margin side and maybe beyond Q2 [indiscernible] level?\nBrian White: Yes. I think, we'd stick with that long-term model that we provided previously. In the recent history, we've been delivering higher gross margins than that, and we would expect that that would continue until we get into the impacts of potentially very large automotive opportunities, and that's why that long-term model provides for a slightly lower gross margin if we need to get there to secure those design wins. But for now, in the foreseeable future, we should be at recent gross margin levels and probably a little bit higher once we get through this inventory correction and get back to slightly higher gross margins that we were posting last fiscal year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Martin Yang from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. [indiscernible].\nFermi Wang: I'm sorry, I cannot hear you well.\nMartin Yang: Can you hear me better now?\nFermi Wang: Yes.\nMartin Yang: [indiscernible]\nLouis Gerhardy: Hey, Jonathan, let's go to the next question, and then we'll give Martin another chance after this question.\nOperator: Okay. Understood. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\nJosh Buchalter: Hi. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for squeezing me in. It is great to see that the CV3 win with Continental for commercial applications. I was wondering if you could provide some initial feedback on how it's going on the consumer passenger vehicle side? I recognize it's only been a few months since the partnerships have been announced, but you're going against some entrenched and large competitors in the central ADAS domain. And I was wondering how Conti and Bosch are positioning your CV3-based solutions to win in that market. Thank you.\nFermi Wang: Yes, I think first of all, we have a strong relationship with both Bosch and Conti, and the Conti has even further collaboration because of software relationship, and you can see that software relationship already starting paying off, not only on the Level 4, but also we start getting our engineers in collaboration on that. So, I think that activity definitely is very helpful. And also on the business development side, both sides are working with the Conti and Bosch definitely help us to address the scale problem partially. And also, we believe that working with Conti -- we continue to believe that working with Conti and Bosch is the right thing for us to do to get design wins in the U.S. and Europe. I think that said, that I also believe that our first Level 2 Plus design will come from China, like I said, because the momentum we see after the Shanghai Auto Show is real and that we not only demoed a powerful chip, but also we demoed something that very few people can do, which is running transformer neural network in a lower-end chip that just nobody out there can demo. Like, the company you mentioned, none of them, the low-end chip can demo transformer efficiently. And the transformer becomes such an important neural network and being used as benchmark everywhere, so particularly in China where AI and neural network performance is very much appreciated. So I think that's a momentum where we definitely enjoyed. And I think -- I hope we can get several design wins in China this year.\nJosh Buchalter: Appreciate the color. That's actually a nice segue to my follow-up. Can you talk about -- I think this is the first time you've mentioned auto being a source of inventory correction despite the results coming in in line with your expectations. Did that get any appreciably worse during the quarter? I know we've all heard about weakness in the China EV market. It would be helpful if you could help us understand your exposure there? And if that worsened and drove, I guess, some incremental weakness during the quarter? Thank you.\nFermi Wang: No. What we said before is we think that our inventory control in auto is much less than the inventory control in IoT. That's what we said. We didn't say auto was not impacted. We definitely see a few -- several customers got impacted, but not as bad as IoT space. So, from that point of view, I think we still think that -- I still expect that when the inventory correction finished, auto should go back to growth.\nJosh Buchalter: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Mr. Yang, your line is now open.\nMartin Yang: Yes. Sorry about my technical issue. Can you hear me now?\nFermi Wang: Yes.\nMartin Yang: I have a question on CV72. So, do you expect your automotive and IoT customers to -- most of them to opt and adopt the Oculii integration that comes with CV72?\nFermi Wang: That's a good question. So, I think, for the IoT, the adoption of radar system will be slower because the core market, the IoT market is moving towards radar, but not as fast as auto. Radar in auto space is basically everywhere. Everybody realizes that they need to have a radar solution in any Level 2 Plus systems. So, I think in terms of adoption that the radar will go to auto space first. For CV72AQ, I think that the radar integration will come later because right now, we're focusing on winning the video side. But however, at the second phase of software development, auto -- radar integration will come also.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you, Fermi.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dr. Fermi Wang for any further remarks.\nFermi Wang: Thank you very much for you to joining us today. Looking forward to talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."
