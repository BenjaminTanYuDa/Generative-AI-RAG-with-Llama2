        "content": "Margherita Della Valle: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our half year results conference call. I’m pleased to be joined today by Luka, our new CFO. Welcome, Luka.\nLuka Mucic: Thanks a lot, Margherita, and great to be with all of you this morning.\nMargherita Della Valle: Now since I have been CEO, I have said that Vodafone must change, and we are changing. Vodafone must change, and we are changing. As you know, my priorities are to focus on our customers, become a simpler business and accelerate growth. To set us on this path, we have taken significant actions over the last six-months. First of all, on customers. We have reprioritized our focus and resources on customer experience and start to see some results. In [ALF 1] (Ph), our NPS position relative to competitors improved in almost all markets. Second, simplicity. We have just completed an end-to-end review of our shared operations and the services they provide to the markets. We will now transition to a commercial model with clear MSAs, volume-based pricing for all services. And yesterday, we announced an agreement with Accenture that will allow us to accelerate this transformation. Last, but not least, growth. We returned to service revenue growth in Germany this quarter, supported by our commercial model reengineering and our broader broadband price actions. Beyond Germany, we have delivered a broad-based improvement in service revenue in Q2 with 14 of 17 markets growing, and we have reiterated our financial guidance for the year. In May, I said we would focus our investments on markets where we see the right combination of sustainable market structures and sufficient scale to grow and to deliver returns above our cost of capital and take actions where these conditions are not met. As a result, we have announced our exit from Spain. In the U.K., we are progressing with approvals for our merger with Three, and we are continuing to explore a range of options in Italy. Overall, we are making progress on our priorities, but of course, we have significantly more work still to do to improve the experience for our customers, cut complexity and operate in a simpler way. We are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Margherita. Our first question is from Maurice Patrick of Barclays. [Operator Instructions]\nMaurice Patrick: Thanks for taking the question. If I could ask a bit about capital allocation priorities for the group, please. At the full-year results, you made a comment around the shape of shareholder returns changing as the perimeter of Vodafone changes. And it doesn’t look as to the perimeter is now changing. After the U.K. deal, you have announced a €5 billion proposed sale, does it go When you announced that deal, you did say you would review the optimal use of proceeds in the context of a broader capital allocation review at closing. So even though maybe today is it premature to sell exactly what you are thinking. It would be great to understand a bit more about your thinking around optimal leverage, what happens in rates they have for longer? How do you think about buyback, dividends, those sort of priorities, I think would be very helpful?\nMargherita Della Valle: Maurice, you are right, back in May when we were talking about capital allocation, I said that we would reevaluate our capital allocation if the shape of the group was to change. We have just chosen to exit Spain because it is a very challenged market. And it is really important for me that in Vodafone, we focus our time pension resources to markets where we have good opportunities to grow markets with sustainable structures, markets where we have sufficient scale to drive returns ahead of cost of capital. In that context, we will do our capital allocation review at the point in time in which the Spanish deal will close. We expect this to be in the first half of calendar 2024. And at that point, we will review the allocation of the €4.1 billion of proceeds that we have from the sale of Spain. In terms of logic that we will follow, the sort of guiding principle will not change. We have three capital allocation priorities around investment, balance sheet and returns. But perhaps as we now have Luka, our new CFO, Luka, how do you see this?\nLuka Mucic: yes, perhaps for me, it is just important to take a step back because before capital allocation comes capital generation. And my first priority actually will be to ensure that the company overall is able to return sustainable growth and cash flow. That is very important, and there is no shortcut there. This will only come through the focus on operational excellence. You have set the right priorities around customer simplicity and growth, and we will drive them hard across all of our markets. And in those markets where this operational excellence focus will not be sufficient as we have just now seen in Spain because of the market structure, then we will not shy away from taking decisive action, either through market consolidation or through an exit. That is important as a baseline. Now my thoughts around the capital allocation priorities are as follows: First of all, on the investment side of the house. I am actually comfortable with the levels of capital intensity and capital investment that we are showing to date across our markets. And so I don’t think that you will need to see a departure from that. I also must say that I’m very pleased with the strength of the balance sheet of Vodafone. Actually, as I have been diving deep into it, it is actually quite remarkable. Yes, we have, of course, significant net debt but it is having a very long maturity on average, 11.7 years. It has a very decent low interest rate attached to it, on average, 2.5%. Actually, in the next 18-months, we have very limited repayments that are coming up. And over the next five-years, it is actually in total, only €13 billion-or-so. So I’m, based on that, also comfortable with around about 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio that we are currently showing. When you then take a look at returns to shareholders, as Margherita has said, we will take our time to look at the optimal use of proceeds and the overall capital allocation framework when the sale of Spain has closed. However, based on what I can see is, obviously, we are around about looking now for €3.3 billion in free cash flow for FY 2024, we are on a positive track towards achieving that. The sale of Spain will, of course, reduce this cash flow a bit. But on the other hand, we are also focused on operational excellence. As I said at the beginning, and we will have a much better way at judging the effect of all of these parameters as we approach the closing. So we will update you on that. And since you have asked that question, of course, buybacks could be part of that mix as well.\nOperator: Next question is from Polo Tang of UBS.\nPolo Tang: It was just about German commercial trends. So with the bulk of the repricing in the broadband base done, how confident are you that broadband declines in Germany can improve going forward? Also, what are your latest thoughts in terms of how much basic cable TV revenues you will lose and how much of an impact will we see in January 2024?\nMargherita Della Valle: Thank you, Polo. On broadband, we will definitely see an improvement on the volume trends. The disconnections of the past two quarters have been driven by our repricing. It was admittedly a very low level of disconnection. We are talking about low single digits. And I think our customers now appreciate the quality of our products in Germany. We probably mentioned this before, but we continue to be rated as the best fixed broadband product in the market, thanks to our network performance and our speed performance and it is competitively priced. As we look into [ALF 2] (Ph), we will still have some disconnections because we have now overcome with price increases 60% of the base. We have one last 10% to go through during Q3. So there will be some disconnection also coming from that in the second half. Beyond that, we look forward to take our fair share of the German fixed broadband market going forward. On MDUs, the second part of your question. This is something where we will start to see movement from the first quarter of calendar 2024. So our Q4, we have had very small volumes of movement throughout the summer. We have completed the three tests one of which was ongoing last time we spoke and we have seen that the redemption rates, the conversion rates towards the new billing, have been between 35% and 65%. As a reminder, 65% is, I would say, the top-end also because it corresponds to the level of customers actually using the service. Our teams in Germany are now busy to prepare for January, when we will start the first volume, and we expect the transition to happen, gradually between, January and July. We have focused on testing all our processes internally in terms of migrations across all channels, online, retail, telesales to make sure that everything runs smoothly from a process perspective. But most importantly, we have been calibrating our commercial approach, our communication, the marketing side of things to ensure that we get the maximum possible results in terms of penetration. It is really a very, very strong focus from our organization in Germany right now. In summary, a first impact on service revenue growth in the last quarter this year. You know that our trend of growth in Germany is actually improving and will continue to improve, if you set aside the MDU transition. To allow you to see this underlying acceleration trend, we will actually report from Q4 the MDU impact separately so that you can work out the two components. And then we expect FY 2025 to have the largest impact from that.\nOperator: Next up, we have James Ratzer from New Street research.\nJames Ratzer: I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about the EBITDA growth phasing going ahead? You have just reported flat organic EBITDA growth, but I think you are saying there is about a five-point drag in there from energy headwinds. So could you give us some thoughts maybe over the next or half yearly blocks, how that energy headwind might unwind and kind of become a potential tailwind on your growth and then to what extent that might be offset by some of the German cable TV losses? Do the two offset each other and do we actually see overall organic EBITDA growth rates improve from here?\nLuka Mucic: Yes, perhaps I will take this question because I have already heard some questions whether our EBITDA outlook confirmation is a sign of German conservatism. So if that is the case, I take that as a compliment. But to outline what we are seeing here. You are absolutely right in half year one energy was a €300 million drag on EBITDA. It was actually outperformed slightly on the organic side through the strong revenue performance and also through continued focus on OpEx savings. We added another €100 million under our OpEx program. However, that is something that we are also looking to reinvest in our customer experience initiatives, but it has helped to offset those investments, which is very important. When I take a look in the second half year, we are actually, by now almost entirely hedged, 94%. So what is remaining is actually in certain markets that we don’t have mechanisms to hedge further. So I can be relatively precise in the sense that we will see actually half year two versus half year one a relief of €200 million roughly in terms of energy headwind that we will not face. Now in terms of the puts and takes on top of that energy topic. There are a couple of important ones. On the positive side, half year one results in the U.K. were negatively influenced by the roll-off an MVNO agreement with Virgin Media that is now lapping and therefore, will also not affect the U.K. numbers any longer. So we would expect the U.K. actually to return to EBITDA growth. In Germany in turn, first of all, we will face the initial impact MDU transition, how much it will be a little bit hard to assess. Margherita has covered on the trial, results, and it will certainly take some time before this is fully transpiring. But on top of this, we also are investing, from a program OpEx perspective, of course, into all of the processes to now go after the retention of our MDU customers, and this is requiring investments from a marketing perspective, from a operational door-to-door and other retention measures perspective. So we have planned around about €100 million of investment under this notion. Not all of that will actually happen in half year two, but a significant portion of it will happen in H2. So when I take a look at that in combination, I see us actually well on track towards our full-year ambition, and we will see where we end up for next year, we are actually already around about 70% hedged from an energy cost perspective and we will see this ratio going up fairly soon to round about 80% already. So I would expect energy to become a tailwind in FY 2025 even though will likely not yet fully return to the levels of FY 2023. In FY 2026, I then fully expect us to be back to levels, let’s say, perhaps slightly above what we saw in FY 2022. And then, of course, the underlying growth that we are seeing in the business should translate into stronger EBITDA growth than what you have seen in H1.\nMargherita Della Valle: Perhaps bringing it altogether, James. We have been very clear when we issued our guidance for FY 2024, that the number we are achieving this year is going to be a base to grow from. And we are intending to grow in FY 2025. As we have just highlighted, we will have the MDU transition impact, but on the offset, we will have the energy unwind, plus all the other typical business puts and takes, net of this, it will be growth.\nOperator: Next up, we have David Wright of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDavid Wright: Okay. I hope you guys can hear me. I guess just on the whole capital allocation issue, we haven’t talked for some time about German fiber. You have obviously got an allocation and an agreement with Altice to co-build around seven million lines-or-so in Germany, but that leaves a lot of cable lines to be invested over time. You obviously have decisions to make with the proceeds of Spain coming up. I’m just wondering to what extent fiber build is something that you could look into owning a little more or whether you are going to continue to pursue the joint venture structure? And if I might just segue that a little into Holland, where there is a broadly similar situation with a full cable network that needs overbuild. Just any plans there because that business looks very unlikely to pay dividend next year, given its leverage and poor operational performance. What is the future for Vodafone do we think?\nMargherita Della Valle: Thank you, David. Starting from German fiber. I think that Luka has been clear earlier in saying that we are comfortable with the level of capital investment we have in the business now. And this does include continuing to invest in the evolution of the cable network in Germany. Our plan is to build fiber on the seven million households through the JV, as you mentioned, but also continue to evolve our cable network. And in that respect, on top of being now well invested and delivering very strong performance, it is worth noting that we have just put into our live network, high split DOCSIS in Germany, which, as you know, allows us to achieve multi-gigabit speeds. So cable itself has its own strong technology road map. And by the way, in the Netherlands, we have also trialed commercially DOCSIS 4 already. So we will keep evolving, and we are happy with where we stand in that respect. Back to the Netherlands, I would say that we are actually competing effectively there. It is not the only market. There are more that have cable and fiber side by side. And you may have noticed that in the last quarter in the Netherlands, we have been growing in consumer fixed. We are focusing really on the areas which do matter most to the customer at the moment. If you look at what’s on offer today. From cable, it is satisfied entirely all the consumer use cases for fixed broadband. What people mostly care about is their experience in the house, the experience in WiFi, that is what makes the biggest day-to-day differences. And this is an area where VodafoneZiggo has been particularly active. And as I said, service revenue is growing again in fixed in the Netherlands. - other dynamics that you see in markets like the Netherlands between cable and fiber are frankly driven by pricing, by promotions. It is not linked to the actual service.\nDavid Wright: Okay. I’m not sure that is entirely what KPN is saying. But at the same time, we have just had a benchmark data point from Telefonica with 2026 domestic CapEx sales guidance of 10%. And that is a function of full fiber build-out, but more importantly, full copper decommissioning. So fiber networks of the incumbents are moving to new levels of capital efficiency and OpEx efficiency over the coming years, which I think will massively outstrip the ability of cable. So is cable to fiber a when not if, and it is the when you are currently debating or you actually do you think cable has a future as a competitive technology, not just for the consumer, but economically to you as a group?\nMargherita Della Valle: The cable networks themselves continuously fiberized. When I was talking about segmentation, it means more firework gradually over time. Then at what pace you go, how do you move also depends very much on market conditions. And as you know, the conditions of Spain are completely different, for example, for the condition of Germany. So what actually makes sense is very different for different operators in different markets.\nOperator: Next up, we have Ottavio Adorisio from Societe Generale. Perfect. A couple of questions on my side. The first, I would start is from Spain. You announced the transactions, whereby, effectively, you will be selling the asset to a company where you were holding 75% of the equity, nonvoting equity, but still 75%. Therefore, you will be participating in any potential downside if the turnaround is not successful. So clearly, you believe the turnaround to be successful. Therefore, my question would be why didn’t do the turnaround yourself? There is an issue that you don’t have or the management of Vodafone doesn’t have the skill set? Do you believe that your investments are not patient enough? So why you would leave the upside to a third-party? And considering that also if the turnaround will not be successful, you don’t have a new recourse on the asset of Zegona. So therefore, you will be left participate in the downside. So therefore, the said question is that why did you leave the stake into the asset? So at least you got your €900 million back on tangible assets rather than a pledge from Zegona? The second one, it is basically related to your leases. And we have Luka, so welcome to the call. The question is on the leases is trying to understand how you capitalize your lease liabilities? Because whenever I do ratio between how much you pay on leases and how much you capitalize, Vodafone comes really at the bottom. Now credit agents like S&P do make their own adjustments because they feel that the lease are too low. So therefore, if you can share with us the assumptions you use to NPV the future leasing payments, that would be great.\nMargherita Della Valle: Ottavio, I would say probably on the second question that you raised, it is best followed through with IR later. I’m sure we will be able to share all the details with you. I will take the Spanish question instead. Let’s be clear. What we have done in Spain is a clean exit for the market. We have €4.1 billion of cash upfront and we have €0.9 billion of deferred compensation. Then the deferred compensation is supported by a financial mechanism, which is the one that you had described, but essentially in a nutshell, we will get up to €0.9 billion whenever there will be liquidity events for the company. We are not exposed to downsize - and we will not be part of any decision-making. It is a clean exit. We have sold 100% of Vodafone Spain. Why did we sell Spain? I go back to what I was saying in the beginning. The Spanish market is incredibly fragmented. Over 70 retail brands, five fiber infrastructures competing, to the point we were touching on earlier with David, in the same cities in the same regions. It is a market that will require more than one round of consolidation. And I really want us to focus on the market where we can drive the best growth and the best returns. That is our mission. The Zegona mission will be for themselves to deliver as much value as they possibly can. We are focused on spending our time and attention on markets where we have greater growth opportunities.\nOttavio Adorisio: If leases questions will be asked a different way. Can I ask a different question? This is one on the working capital. So when we look at H1 result in free cash from Vodafone, it is always deep red. And of course, we always attribute this working capital. This working capital swings are becoming bigger and bigger. So we just wonder if you can give us a bit of the elements and what Luka is going to do going forward to avoid these big swings from one year to another?\nLuka Mucic: Yes. That is perhaps the one that I can cover. As I said, I mean, I will be really strongly focused on sustainable cash flow generation. And that covers all of the aspects, not only working capital management, but also how to improve the general cash conversion across the business. Significant part of that mix should also be in the future the accelerating growth in Vodafone business because that has a much lower capital intensity and actually, therefore, a higher potential also in the short-term to improve the cash flow generation. You are right, when I take a look at the historical evolution of the half year one versus half year two swings, they are becoming bigger. We are confident because we have anticipated what we are looking at now in H1 at our full-year cash flow generation. It is also partially a result of the significant buildup that we have seen towards the end of the last fiscal year, which has resulted in the significant unwind here. So that is fully anticipated. From a go-forward perspective, clearly, there are some levers, like, for example, taking a look at the way how we build up or build down the amount of trade receivables that we have that is mainly driven by handset receivables financing that could be structured differently. We will take a look at those options, but it is one of the strategic priority programs that I’m driving within the finance organization to derisk our profile in this respect for the future. But having said all of that, actually, where we are right now in half year one is exactly in line with where we thought we would be. And hence, we were also able to confirm our guidance for the full-year.\nOperator: Next, we have Georgios Ierodiaconou of Citigroup.\nGeorgios Ierodiaconou: Luka, the main one is around Italy? And in your opening remarks, Margherita, you mentioned that Italy is under review. Just wanted maybe to touch on a couple of things. Firstly, the developments we are seeing in Spain, whether these encourage you or discourage you in pursuing in market consolidation? I guess that is subjective in it in carbon competitive markets like Italy? And that may also apply, perhaps, through many other markets, but curious to hear from you if you believe based on what we hear, whether the options are still available for you? And if you could also perhaps touch a bit on the legislation changes around the win back promotions that Vodafone and the incumbent are having in the market and whether that could be a meaningful impact to your business? And I hope you don’t mind. I will also ask one clarification given few of my peers have gone beyond the first question, which is around, common functions. There is been a significant reduction in losses this quarter. Curious if it is cost cutting or charging the subsidiaries more, and also, if you can give us some indications on how the Spanish deal will affect this division in the next couple of years?\nMargherita Della Valle: So perhaps Luka, I will hand over to you the common functions question, and I will start from Italy. The changes which are being discussed on buybacks for everybody’s benefit, it is whether buybacks can be customized by the different provenance of the customers or not is what is being debated in Italy at the moment. I think the jury is out on the type of impact this is going to have. I have been reflecting that it can go either way in a sense because it can potentially lower the offers in general, but it could also drive more discipline in the approach that people take to the so-called below-the-line win back offers that are so prevalent in the market. Either way, I don’t think that will change the substance of Italy being a very competitive market. But I think the incremental impact could grow in either direction. We will see. Reflecting on Italy more broadly, where do we stand there? My focus remains on the 3 markets I called out in May, as I said at the beginning. So U.K., Spain and Italy, I said in May would all benefit from portfolio actions. And therefore, in Italy, we will continue to explore consolidation opportunities. Our position in Italy is very different from our position in Spain. We have a very strong company in Italy. As you know, you will have seen from the latest results that also this quarter, as we do consistently quarter in, quarter out for years, we have been outperforming all the other established players in terms of service revenue growth. We have a strong brand, a strong network. We are outperforming also because we are very strong on the business side of things. Over 35% of our revenues are B2B in Italy now, and you will have seen as we have started reporting more granularity on B2B that we have effectively high single-digit growth in B2B in Italy now. And we are competing effectively in consumer overall relative to the other players. That doesn’t change the fact that it remains a very challenging market. None of the players in Italy delivers returns in excess of cost of capital. Prices are below cost. So no matter how many efficiency we drive, as we have done more recently with the latest 1,000 road restructuring, the market itself needs action which is why we will continue to review a range of options. As always, in this case, it is not possible to set deadlines or comment any further, but the market does require action.\nLuka Mucic: Yes, and perhaps just to add against your question around common functions, you are absolutely right. Last year, we had a significantly higher amount of costs in common functions that was then charged out in the second half of the year compared to this year. I think what you see this year is a combination, a, of slightly more even spreading and phasing, but also savings. As we have said, we continue to focus on lean corporate services and having our OpEx savings program. So that is partially contributing to the lower cost. So it will be a more even distribution than what you will see last year with also some net savings that will flow through to the year-end.\nMargherita Della Valle: You also raised the question of what happens with the sale of Spain to our common functions. I think this links to what you may have seen an announcement on this also yesterday to the transformation we are doing in our shared operations. Our scale has been a great source of efficiencies for Vodafone. And we will be keen to make sure we continue to develop those efficiencies. So we are making our shared operations fully commercial with effectively MSAs in place between the group center and the countries to drive more efficiencies there and also to be more effective in selling to third parties, which could be JVs, which could be other partners in the industry so that we continue to benefit from our scaled strength.\nOperator: Next question is going to be from Akhil Dattani of JPMorgan.\nAkhil Dattani: Great. Margherita, can I maybe ask a question on your NPS comments from earlier in your presentation obviously, you have outlined on Slide 16 the trends that you are seeing at the moment. But I guess I was trying to understand better exactly how we should interpret this? And I guess what I’m trying to understand is that, firstly, when I look at your major European markets, you are not a market leader in any of these regions. And whilst you are highlighting some select gap reductions, we still don’t know how big the gaps are. So how do we really try and interpret this data? Is it an improvement, but there is still a very wide gap? Do you think you are really structurally closing that gap and you can start to become a market leader? So maybe if you can just comment on that. And I guess similar to the last one, I just had a quick clarification, which was just that you have announced on consolidation a Spanish merger despite the fact we don’t yet know what the remedy situation will be from the Orange, MASMOVIL deal. And you are also now saying you are looking at potential options in Italy despite the fact we don’t know that. So how do we interpret that? Is that to say you don’t think this matters or could we even interpret that you are maybe concerned about how this might play out and you prefer to move ahead of that?\nMargherita Della Valle: Maybe I will pick up the second first. It is very simple. As I was mentioning earlier, I think the situation of the Spanish market will remain challenging, whether or with or without a merger between Orange and MASMOVIL because of the position it is in, which is why at the end of the strategic review, having examined all options and discussed with a range of counterparties, we have taken the decision we have taken, and we have chosen the deal that was giving us the best combination between value creation and transaction certainty. If I think instead about NPS, this for me is really, really important. You have not seen absolute NPS numbers in our reporting because as you can imagine, this is truly commercially sensitive, but we have started reporting on trends now, and we will continue to do so in the future. This is the first instance of the scorecard announced in May, and it is the same data points that we will be looking at inside the company. If you were walking into Vodafone now across the group, the focus on customers is the biggest change that you will notice. We are really single-mindedly obsessed with winning customers trust every day. That is our mantra. And in order to get there, you know that we are reallocating more money to customer experience, €150 million in the budget of this year, but we have also a wide range of initiatives. In every market, there are weekly, monthly reviews, all focused on how do we make our customer life simpler? And I think this is a real opportunity, by the way, for all Telcos. We see it in operational results. We have not done big starts, but we see simple things like waiting times in our core centers dropping and the like. On the big numbers, we look at two things primarily. We look at the mix of detractors and promoters within our own customer base, and we have also included that in our incentive plans from this year, and we look at our Net Promoter Score position relative to competitors. As you were noticing, I think it was good to see. And clearly, there are no quick fixes on customer satisfaction. So we are talking about a long journey ahead. But it was good to see that despite, for example, the inflationary environment we have been leaving in, in the last six-months, we are starting to see the numbers hedging in the right direction, both in terms of absolute and in terms of relative position, which is why we are reporting on the gap to competitors. So a long journey, but I think it is one which is really important for us. That is what Vodafone is about serving customers and it was heartwarming to see that we are starting to see the KPIs etching in the right direction.\nAkhil Dattani: Margherita, just to clarify, I mean, that is very helpful, firstly. How should we try and think about - I understand not wanting to give absolutes, and I think that obviously makes sense. But how do we think about the gap? Like if you are trying to conceptualize for us like how big the gap is versus your peers in your major European markets? How do you think about that?\nMargherita Della Valle: It varies enormously, and the gap we measure as well, Akhil, is the gap versus the best player and the best player can be a very different type of player to say, we have published that we have reduced that gap by 20% in the last year. That gives you a sense of progress, and we will continue, as I said, to report against that.\nOperator: Next up, we have Jakob Bluestone from Exane.\nMargherita Della Valle: Welcome back, Jakob.\nJakob Bluestone: Exciting to be back. I had a question on free cash flow, just following on from James’ question earlier. Your free cash flow for the year, you are guiding for it to be down by about €1.5 billion from 48 to 33 who is down about €1 billion in H1. So implicitly, you are guiding for a substantially better free cash flow development in the second half than in the first half. In your response to James’ question, you said it is not coming through from better EBITDA growth. So can you maybe just help us understand what is it that is going to get better in the second half to drive what looks like a much better implied H2 free cash flow performance year-on-year adjusting for seasonality?\nLuka Mucic: Yes. Sure, I mean, at the end of the day, it is, of course, the focus on reversing all of the trends that you have seen at play in H2, you typically have a much better positive impact on trade receivables and from a working capital perspective, that is what we will certainly look to drive and to achieve the corresponding outcomes. On the EBITDA side, you are right. We are kind of looking prudently at roughly similar performance than what we have seen in H1. So it is essentially the usual written of the seasonality of cash flows that will fully come to fruition. And then we are looking for next year forward for a more even spread as we look at the focus on change measures.\nMargherita Della Valle: Just a point we may have covered in the past, Jakob, and I’m just trying to remember if we did. There are two technical drivers of a working capital swing between ALF 1 and ALF 2 in Vodafone. One is the phasing of CapEx. You have typically a sort of 40-60 split between ALF 1 and ALF 2 CapEx. So obviously, you end up paying more of the CapEx in half 1. And second, which is something that we may reconsider and Luka is working on now, is historically, we have done all our handset receivable sales in ALF 2. And this is why you accumulate in ALF 1 and then it swings back in ALF 2. And these two effects together are driving a very, very significant swing. I think we have opportunities going forward to rephase the receivable technical execution during the year so that you can follow smoother trend.\nLuka Mucic: Yes, at the end of the day, the growth in the business overall, then of course, results in the fact that the material that we have available for the swing and to drive it is actually getting bigger. But again, we are looking for ways to smoothen this going forward. Operator And we just have time for one last question this morning, and that is going to be from Andrew Lee of Goldman Sachs.\nAndrew Lee: Okay. Yes. Welcome, Luka. I had two follow-ups, if that is all right. They are hopefully both relatively brief. The first one just follows on from what you were talking about to Jokob’s question around working capital swings. Just checking that in terms of smoothing things you are not planning on using factoring or vendor financing, given obviously, Telco investors and the market in general are hyperallergic to those approaches. I just wanted to check on that sort of things. And then I had a growth question follow-up on - and also follow-up to James’ question earlier in the call on the revenue growth versus EBITDA growth. I think his question is around the energy swings. I just wanted to ask kind of more structurally, we had a couple of Telcos talk to service revenue growth, but exhibiting limited operational gearing. And so I just wanted to ask your thoughts on the scope for operational gearing. Let’s take Germany, just as your core market. I think Germany, for its 1% service revenue growth delivered about 1% EBITDA decline out energy. But obviously, still, we are not seeing a translation of EBITDA growth. So is there something structural splitting out NRG and kind of volatile factors, is there anything structural that is stopping this operational gearing, be it revenue mix, deterioration or whatever?\nMargherita Della Valle: Just on the vendor financing because I know what you are thinking, Andrew, not the kind you are thinking about. And again, we can give you more comments on but the operational gearing.\nLuka Mucic: Yes. First of all, on the first one, no new fancy mechanisms. It is just a matter of are we wanting to really put everything to the far end of the business here. or perhaps come to a more even application of the programs that we have already in place. So on the EBITDA and the gearing side of the house, I think what you need to take into account is that we have not only the EBITDA challenge by energy at the moment. We are also consciously using this year, the savings that we are having under our OpEx program to reinvest very consciously in additional initiatives around customer experience. And that is the right investment to make from a long-term perspective because it will, at the end of the day, result in better retention, lower churn, and that will drive profitability. So no, I don’t think that there is something structural in the business and how it evolves that will kind of dilute the potential of us to provide operating leverage. If anything, I would say I’m very confident that based on the cost leadership that Vodafone has always exhibited, we will continue to drive successfully for the €1 billion in OpEx savings and going forward, thinking about the next business year and further on, as we have righted the ship and focused appropriately on a customer experience, you will also see more of that translating then into further EBITDA growth.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A from this morning. Thank you for joining, and we will see you again next time.\nLuka Mucic: Yes. See you all.\nMargherita Della Valle: Thank you. Bye."

        "content": "Margherita Della Valle: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining me for our First Quarter Update. Before discussing our trading, I'd like to highlight some other news from this morning. You may have seen that we have announced the appointment of Luka Mucic as our new CFO. Luka joins us from SAP, where he was most recently the COO and CFO. I really look forward to welcoming him in September and, of course, having him with us for half 1 in November. Turning to our Q1 trading update. When I took over, I was clear that Vodafone needed to change to reduce complexity, get back to basics in consumer, reengineer our commercial model in Germany and scale up our business segment. As we progress our plans to transform Vodafone, I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a better service revenue performance across almost all of our markets in Q1, and we have also reiterated our EBITDAaL and cash flow guidance for the year. We have delivered organic service revenue growth of 3.7% or 1.8%, excluding Turkey. We are back to service revenue growth in Europe, and our performance in Vodafone Business has been particularly strong with service revenue up 4.5% this quarter, supported by strong digital services growth. In our largest market, Germany, service revenue trends have started to improve, supported by successful price actions in fixed, and we have taken action to drive a better commercial performance in mobile. More broadly, across the company, we have taken the first steps of our action plan focused on customers, simplicity and growth. But of course, with 3 major markets still in negative territory, we know that we have much more still to do.\nOperator: Thank you, Margherita. We now go to the Q&A. And our first questioner this morning is Andrew Lee from Goldman Sachs. Andrew, if would like to unmute yourself. Thank you, please go ahead.\nAndrew Lee: I just had a question around Germany. So as you mentioned, your service revenue growth trends have improved, still negative improved and that's on the back of price take, which I think you've been pretty clear, we should see further benefits from price take through the next couple of quarters. So my question is around the KPIs. I wonder if you could just articulate where you think German broadband KPIs go from here, and your plans for price take versus volume balance from here with maybe mention on the competitive intensity and how that feeds into things.\nMargherita Della Valle: Sure. Andrew, let me say, on the volume versus value balance, I think it's really important beyond Germany that we keep in mind, give overall value accretion beyond the sort of last 10,000 or 20,000 of net-adds. Our focus really over the last couple of quarters has been on executing price actions, which was really important, considering the inflationary environment we are in. So looking forward, you will see a gradual reacceleration on the net-adds front. But the most important point for me was really making sure that we drive the overall top line performance. Coming on to Germany, specifically, we were pleased to see mobile back into positive territory. And importantly, all driven by our own brands, so a really good step-up there that will continue in the coming quarters and is the result of the commercial model engineering that the team is executing. We, for example, have launched recently in June, new family cards in the market. You know that we have a big proposition agenda there. In broadband then, the numbers of the quarter clearly are impacted by the execution of the segmented price increase on the base and you will see another quarter coming up in Q2 of, if you want, similar negative territory. Maybe a quick update on that before we move to the forecasting of net-adds in broadband. First of all, we're saying we have done a price increase of EUR 5 against a very significant improvement of the quality of our products. And I think this has been now underscored, if you look at the last few weeks, including actually this morning, by 4 independent tests in Germany, all calling out our leading position in terms of fixed broadband product and networks in the country, which is good to see and support the price repositioning. Customers' bills have been impacted by this EUR 5 starting from May, and this will continue all the way to September. We are now 50% through the extraordinary notice period. So 50% of the base we were targeting has completed the notice period. And although you have seen significant negative net adds in the quarter, this is really driven by the churn of these customers, which is very, very low and better than our business case. So definitely value accretive and will continue, together with the mobile improvement, to support a gradual improvement of our service revenue performance in Germany in the coming quarters. Moving to net-adds then. As I said, Q2 still affected by the extraordinary disconnections and then significant improvement into the second half as we will return, I would say, also in acquisition to the normal commercial intensity that, as you would expect, you don't have as you execute the price increases. So for that, type of step up. You will have to wait for a little bit longer. But overall, an accretive trend for our service revenues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Ratzer at New Street. James, if you would like to unmute yourself.\nJames Ratzer: So my question on from what you were commenting on there about really kind of value versus volume. I mean you've had a quite a clear strategy over the last 12 to 18 months to move more towards [Indiscernible] price increases coming through now across all your markets. But yet service revenue growth in Europe is still around just kind of 1% at the moment. So what I'd love to kind of think about and hear from is how does the story kind of develop from here, because even though we have substantial headline front book price increases coming through, it seems like there's still a little bit of a drag on the back book. So how do you think about your business developing over the next, say, 12, 24 months to try to improve the overall blended back book ARPU from here, and can we therefore see a further acceleration in service revenue growth?\nMargherita Della Valle: Thank you, James. And I think it's a fair challenge in terms of where we are in European service revenue growth. Although I think it's important to call out the fact that our major market is a drag on European service revenue growth for more than 1% at the moment. So clearly, this has an influence on the overall results. If I look to the midterm but sort of 12, 24 months, I think it's probably a bit early to call out growth rates for FY '25, but I see a number of as usual puts and takes. We will have material one-off negative on service revenue growth starting from Q4, but mainly in FY '25 with the housing association transition in Germany and that's a negative, but at the other end of the spectrum, we have a number of accelerating factors that will play out. Vodafone Business, you have seen it reaching 4.5% this quarter, driven by digital services, strong demand across the board. We expect continued very good growth there in the coming quarters. From a commercial perspective, the point I was making to Andrew earlier, we expect increasing support from the commercial model changes that we are making in Germany and in Spain and better net-adds performance that over time will also support better revenue growth. And finally, we will continue to have, obviously, our CPI mechanism in play also in the midterm that will support growth acceleration. In terms of back book and front book, you know that we are very keen in Vodafone to maintain alignment between those wherever possible. Which is why, once again, I was calling out earlier, the fact that sometimes there are trade-offs to be made, but they are the right trade-offs, and we shouldn't obsess about relatively small KPIs movements, which are temporary. Maybe the area where there has been the most significant evolution at the moment, but it's an area that keeps evolving, as you know, so I can't make big prediction, is the U.K. You know that in the U.K., we always go out, align front book, back book. We had very strong success in making sure this was the case in fixed, where the market reaction has been rational last year and also this year. So that's a good development on mobile. Last year in the U.K., there was a sort of unwinding happening on the front book, which is why we are seeing dilution in our U.K. numbers at the moment. This year was a bit more mixed with also some positive moves on the front book. So we will have to see how these develop in every market during the year. There isn't a standard recipe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ottavio Adorisio from Societe Generale, who is joining us by phone this morning. Ottavio, if you would like to unmute yourself, you are [Indiscernible] \nOttavio Adorisio: Basically just a follow-up from previous two. And just to try to understand how the progress will look into revenues or we would expect for revenues and EBITDA over the next few quarters in Europe and particularly in markets where you've been recording net-add losses a bit everywhere in fixed and significant net-add flats in the U.K. in mobile and Italy? So pricing, if I understand well, pricing takes effect immediately, while customer losses crystallize over time, also because some of your customers are locked into contracts. So if you can just tell us how much of the price increase today, the impact was on the back book vis-a-vis the front book? And how much of the customers had the time to react to these prices and what will be the outlook for the second part of the year when you believe that a number of these customers to have the ability to look around and see if there are any alternatives? And second, did you see within your tariffs, any optimization from your customers? I see that in the U.K., despite you had a 14.4% increase in prices from the 1st of April, the growth was only a fraction of that. So I'm just wondering how -- if you can just tell us a bit about the bridge how you go from such pretty staggering increase in prices to put more modest increase on revenues?\nMargherita Della Valle: I hope I have taken notes of all the elements of, I would call it, the multipart question, but if I start on service revenue maybe and the EBITDA evolution and then we'll move to the example of the U.K. in terms of dynamics of front book and back book. So if I go back to what do we expect in the coming quarters from service revenue as a result of all these trends, I would say, first, let me reiterate that it was good to see a first step on revenues in the right direction with this broad-based improvement across the group, although, of course, with three major markets in negative, more remains to be done. But what certainly I can say is that we now target positive service revenue growth in Europe for the remainder of the year and, of course, good growth for the group overall. As I was mentioning earlier, we expect incremental support through the coming quarters coming from Germany as a result of both the fixed broadband price action and the mobile commercial reengineering. Against that, of course, we always need to keep in mind that we play in some very challenging markets, particularly in Southern Europe, but a good outlook ahead on the service revenue performance from an EBITDA perspective. Clearly, as we get into the first half of the year, we will have the big impact of energy price increases because of the timing of our hedging last year. The second half of the year in '23 was already impacted by energy costs, but not the first half. So almost all of the energy impact this year is going to be in half 1 with a negative impact on EBITDA, but we will then rebound in the second half. And I can confirm today that we are tracking to our guidance of broadly stable EUR 13.3 billion of EBITDA for the year. And then as you know, beyond FY '24, we've been really clear that this number is, for us, a new base to grow from as we move into FY '25 and beyond. I hope that this overview sort of brings together all the elements of your points in terms of what we expect to see coming from the actions we are taking now and it is a positive outlook. In terms of more specifically front book and back book, each market has its own dynamics and absolutely our numbers bring in some back book -- sorry, front book dilution impact. And this is the story, for example, that you are seeing in the U.K. In the U.K., we have very good growth at 5.7%, includes double-digit growth in consumer. Within this double-digit growth, you have the back book repricing as well as a gradual dilution when back book and front book have not been realigned, which is why I was answering to James earlier that it's really important, wherever possible, to keep those aligned. But even when they are not, as you can see, we get positive results. Maybe actually one more point, but I think I mentioned this to Andrew earlier, you are wondering what, sort of, customers think, et cetera. Really important for us to have seen the positive accretion of the main price action we have taken this quarter, which has been the fixed broadband segmented repricing in Germany. We have very good results with now 50% of the customer base beyond the extraordinary notice period, very low churn, and very good net impact looking forward for us. So just wanted to maybe reiterate that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Polo Tang at UBS. Polo, please go ahead.\nPolo Tang: Just have a question around the appointment of Luka Mucic as the new CFO. Can you maybe comment on what qualities led you and the Board to choose him? And will this appointment lead to a change in the way the company operates?\nMargherita Della Valle: I was actually smiling when I was doing my introduction when I was talking about our priorities in growth focused around Germany turnaround and B2B. And as you can see, Luka brings this multiyear experience. He has been CFO for almost 10 years in a very large multinational in B2B and, of course, with a strong presence in Germany. So I really look forward to him joining the team and bringing all his experience. Also the experience of technology. It's not something we talk about in these calls for good reasons. But as you can imagine, a lot of focus is happening in Vodafone around AI, and I think bringing someone in who has had a more direct experience of these developments for us is going to be good. So I look forward to have someone not just next to me in these calls, but also supporting me in driving value creation for Vodafone with the wealth of experience he is bringing. Maybe I should also add that I've been knowing Luka for many years, because, well, we were a customer for SAP. And I also managed, at some point in my career, to make SAP a customer of Vodafone in Germany. So we have been knowing each other sometime.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Carl Murdock-Smith at Berenberg. Carl, please unmute yourself. Your line is open.\nCarl Murdock-Smith: I just wanted to ask about the strength in business that you've achieved today. You talked about it being largely driven by digital services. I was wondering if you could provide some commentary by kind of country and also by customer size as well? Are you seeing it more from large customers or smaller customers? And to what extent is the European recovery fund assisting that acceleration? And then also, in terms of the 3.3% revenue growth in business in Q1, can you confirm whether on the back of an envelope, I think that means that the consumer business in Europe declined by about 1%. So I was just wondering if you could confirm that math as well.\nMargherita Della Valle: Sure. Vodafone Business acceleration is quite broad-based. You have seen service revenue growth in Europe at 3.3%. We are growing in all markets with one exception of Spain. When we report business, by the way, Carl, we include SoHo in the mix, which sometimes can be linked to the consumer dynamics, which is why I think actually I was reflecting on your last part of your question, maybe we need to think about how we make it up in the future. But it's really strong growth, if you want, the SME plus segment all the way to public sector. In terms of segments, actually I would really call out public sector as one that is driving really strong acceleration at the moment. And it's both on the digital services front as well as the connectivity front. If I look at the quarter-on-quarter acceleration we have had, digital service has been strong all along. If you look at the numbers, connectivity, particularly fixed connectivity has been a significant step up, led by the public sector, and in some cases, the SME segment, which is the other one where we are particularly strong. European recovery funds, it's a mixed picture, I'd say, not much would be the answer. There is still a lot that is stuck in a bottleneck at the moment. So very limited impact in our results so far. We still hope for and unblocking of these bottlenecks going forward. But it's material only in 1 country at the moment. It's Italy where there are some connectivity vouchers being distributed, and we are getting a good share of that. But not yet materially in Spain or elsewhere in the numbers. Again, the funding is still there, but we need to see how it develops in the coming quarters. By products then, I would call out the usual software. So cloud and IoT are very, very strong with the added benefit now becoming material in our numbers of security. And we are seeing really good results across the board. I would like to call out, not just in terms of service revenue top line, but also in terms of margin, which is very important to me, we see good growth in Vodafone Business margin overall. It's clearly different depending on which of these products you call out, but it's a very strong dynamic that we are seeing in business, and we want to build further on it in the coming quarters. Consumer, sorry, I was thinking to the last part of your question, I don't have the precise data point at hand, but certainly still affected in Spain and Italy by negative results there.\nOperator: The next question this morning comes from John Karidis at Numis. John, please unmute yourself. You are in the line.\nJohn Karidis: I wonder if we can talk a little bit about the change of the German TV law next year. In May, you identified that the revenue at risk is about EUR 800 million. And related to this, I just sort of wondered, first of all, the profitability of that EUR 800 million? And secondly, what is the risk that with that basic TV revenue you also lose the related telecom, I guess, predominantly broadband revenue. And what is the quantum of that, please?\nMargherita Della Valle: Sure. So starting from maybe the easy bits. The margin is high because there is no real content cost associated to these basic TV products. So we are talking about 80% to 90% margin on the EUR 800 million, which are in play for the MDU transition. And in terms of the broadband aspect, there isn't an immediate read across in terms of losing a TV customer and losing the broadband customers because we are talking about two completely separate situations. In one case, at the moment, the TV is built, if you want, on the rental cost, so the customer doesn't see directly the relationship to Vodafone, whilst these customers have completely separate deals with the relationship to Vodafone in broadband. So there is no direct connection, except for the fact that, obviously, there will be a lot of marketing going on in Germany around these customers, but we see this also as an opportunity for Vodafone to increase its penetration and take advantage of the marketing effort we need to do to manage the transition to actually increase our market share on broadband. So you could have some loss and some wins, but dependent on marketing efforts, don't see this as being particularly material. On then what we see in terms of evolution on this. You may remember that I shared some data from the first two trials we had executed on the transition in Q4 in May. I should remind that the big volumes of housing associations tend to move in January because these are annual contracts made on calendar years. And therefore, we will only get big volumes again in January '24. So between May and now, we couldn't play with big volumes of customer movements. What we have seen is, just as a reminder, we had two trials and one was still open. So there was a small trial in which we had achieved 65% penetration in the transition with plenty of resources dedicated to it, and we had a second trial on a bigger scale, which was still running and was at a lower rate of penetration. Since then, the trial has continued and the penetration has increased, but it has not reached the 60%, 65% of the first trial. We have then one more piece of news, but it's on relatively small numbers because of what I was just describing. We have been working on refining our techniques in terms of how we communicate with the customers and how we manage the process. And we have then done another, let's call it, third small trial, which has delivered, with slightly different techniques, another 60% redemption levels. What we are going to do going forward between now and January, when the big volumes will move, is to continue to refine these approaches, both from a commercial and the technology perspective, to make sure that we maximize our opportunities.\nJohn Karidis: If I may, Margherita, regarding this particular issue, so the housing associations, it's essentially your revenue to lose if it happens. Therefore, when you talk about broadband and marketing campaigns, it's not clear to me how you can actually gain given that you have those already, I'm guessing. So is it at all possible to say what the sort of broadband revenue is attached to this EUR 800 million revenue, please?\nMargherita Della Valle: It's actually a very different set of circumstances, John, if I may, because our penetration in the MDUs involved is actually still in the low 30s. So we have our cable network in the low 30s with plenty of opportunity to grow penetration against DSL in the housing association. So as we have to contact our customers -- sorry, we have to contact our TV customers, our basic TV customers, to help them through the migration, it's a great opportunity for upselling DSL.\nOperator: Our next question this morning comes from Nick Delfas at Redburn.\nNick Delfas: Just a quick question on Net Promoter Scores. I don't know if you have any update on how those are tracking across the European business. And then going on to the German price increases. I was finding it difficult to know exactly what scale we should be applying. So is it possible to tell us what percentage of the revenue base the price increases apply to, so we can try and estimate what the net effect might be?\nMargherita Della Valle: Thanks, Nick. And yes, on the last point, certainly, I can add the color, but 2/3 of the base was our target roughly for this. Now it's fair to say having seen the results so far, we are also considering an extension now to maybe another 5% to 10%, but this is still something we are looking into and has not been decided yet. And then the price increase is quite uniform with EUR 5 applied to everyone. NPS, yes, we will have the chance to expand more broadly on NPS in half one and the full year when we will look at our strategic KPIs. But in terms of update for now, clearly a top priority, as you know, for me, and it's good news. We had a first step up in NPS in Europe in Q4, an early movement. And we are very pleased to have seen that we have fully maintained our position in Q1 despite the execution of the price increases. We knew seasonally, looking also at last year in some markets, when CPI came into play, that you can have a seasonal drop now in telcos and then you recover when this drop didn't happen. So we have sustained the improvement into Q1. And we are well on track to deliver our plans that my key target to make sure that really the full company is mobilized. And I need to say this is what's giving me the best progress so far is to reduce our detractors by 30% this year. And I have all markets focused on the goal. We are running in the markets weekly 6 Boards to address customers' issues. And it's also good to see how the new governance that we are running has made the market more agile in pursuing these goals. And of course, as you know, it's something that is also very much now tied into our own incentive plans for all CEOs, all exco members, the customer KPIs are almost double in incentive plans from what they were last year at 40%. So a big mobilization of the companies to give the customers the simple experience, seamless experience that they've come to expect. And it's good to see change happening. But I will expand more on this when we will show you all the numbers in the first half. Actually, one more point that we see as very important in our, obviously, main market in Germany is the impact on NPS that we are seeing coming from the improvement of the cable network. The quality has stepped up. We have seen it recognized externally as well, couldn't have been more broadly recognized, and we see it coming through in our customer data as well.\nOperator: The next question this morning comes from Robert Grindle at Deutsche Bank. Robert, please unmute yourself. Your line is open.\nRobert Grindle: You mentioned in the video the focus on commercializing shared operations. Where are you at on that initiative, please? I think you mentioned in the video that you've completed the headcount reduction in central functions. What are the next steps?\nMargherita Della Valle: Yes. I'd say, two initiatives here, not necessarily directly connected in the execution. So the first one is really a process change, which is this commercialization of shared operations. And there, we have done, in the last couple of months, a full blueprint of what we want the commercial model to be for each of the services that we provide within our shared operations, anything from data centers, finance operations, you name it. All the teams have been hard at work to establish the framework in terms of SLAs, P/Q pricing model, et cetera, et cetera. And we are doing all this to be ready to lock it in, in our next planning process, so that from the 1st of April, our shared operations relationship with the markets will be on a pure commercial basis. And I already look forward to us running the first planning cycle in the coming months and see how this can make us more efficient in creating what I would call a healthy tension around our services between the market demand and the group supply. In parallel, we have our simplification plans in both the HQ and markets, which are the basis of the 11,000 job reductions that I called out in May. Of those, we have now taken action over 1/3. As you saw on the video completing a second tranche now since the beginning of the year in our headquarter. And the other markets, which are very active on this front are Italy, where we have closed an agreement with the union on the 1,000 job reductions, and also Germany, which is still ongoing with the union discussions. So I would say good progress on achieving the simplification side and good progress also on the shared operations commercial model aspect.\nOperator: The next question this morning comes from David Wright at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. David, please go ahead.\nDavid Wright: My question was just around Spain. I understand you have taken or you have cut, is it around 15% of stores or so, I believe, is the data point. I wanted to understand, is that very Spain specific? Or is there a business model emerging there to maybe more aggressively rationalized stores? And just any updates on the Spanish business in general? You obviously committed to reviewing the operation back at the full year results. I mean, I guess we probably have to wait for the decision on the Spanish merger, as that will obviously affect the landscape of Spain. Is that a fair conclusion to make that we just need to see that really before you can sort of take any more significant actions around Spain?\nMargherita Della Valle: On your first point, David, yes, we are working on, if you want, gradually shifting distribution to more digital channels, that's true across the Board, but this particular initiative and this particular step change is really specific to Spain. So let me build on Spain's organic and inorganic. I called out a strategic review of Spain in May, and this means we are running Spain differently. I'll explain how in a minute. And we're also, of course, considering structural change because they are very much needed in the context of the market. On running Spain differently. I have asked Mario, the new CEO, and his team to do a complete review and revisit our commercial strategy in the market. And I need to say they've been very fast in doing so. And you will have seen effectively three main changes happening already in the last quarter for us in Spain. One is the one you are calling out, which is the restructuring of our retail channel, 15% of stores cut, but also some dealer networks eliminated in the process, clearly with some impact early in the quarter on our net-adds performance. Second and third actions were on the commercial front on high end, improving our position, strengthening our position on the high end of the market with the Vodafone brand with some Flex handset contracts associated to it. And at the low end, think about it low brand, we have been much more active above the line, and we have launched a new entry point in convergence. As a result of all these initiatives, the net adds performance in the quarter has also evolved in Spain. And if I look to June and now July, actually, our net-adds performance in Spain is now broadly stable. And it's one of the elements together with the evolution of Germany that I had in mind when I was calling out the progressive improvement you should expect to see in our commercial performance going forward. So I would say, good progress organically. Actually, let me say that also service revenue you should see gradually improving in Spain in the coming quarter. But I would say, in the context of the market, as we know, more needs to be done, which is where the inorganic aspects are also being taken into consideration. And we are considering, at the moment, a range of options on the inorganic front. Obviously, too early to comment on those today. We will share the news of the options we've decided to pursue when we will have more information to share.\nDavid Wright: But are they on the table sort of now? Or do we have to wait really to understand the decision on Orange-Mas?\nMargherita Della Valle: David, it depends is the only answer I can give.\nOperator: We have time for 1 last question this morning, which comes from Georgios Ierodiaconou from Citigroup. Georgios, please go ahead. \nGeorgios Ierodiaconou: I've got a question and a half, please. So my question is more of a follow-up around the theme of your traditional performance. You've been very clear about the churn drivers and how these will progress over the year. But I believe, in May, you also highlighted the reinvestment of the price increases commercially. I'm curious whether this has started already? Or is it back-end loaded? I'm guessing in certain countries like Germany, there's IT preparation before you launch certain things. But curious to hear whether commercially, there's a gross add story also coming later in the year. And then my half question is just a clarification around there's been a lot of news flow around your partner in the German fiber JV, whether you could give us some assurances and some color on how the deal was structured? Whether this news flow at all could affect you?\nMargherita Della Valle: Sure. Maybe I'll start with the German JV. We don't see implications from the fraud and the JV debt is fully funded for the next four years. The JV was completed in March, as you know, and we are ramping up the operations with the view of starting digging in Germany around September, so right after the summer, and it's progressing well. On the gross-adds element, let me try to bring together maybe slightly different aspects. First of all, on the reinvestment, the reinvestment is actually happening already. See it as focused on 2 main areas. One is customer experience. And again, back to NPS, focused on reducing detractors, giving our customers the service that they expect, and at which telcos, more broadly, I would argue, not just Vodafone, are not particularly strong at. And here, of course, we are already spending. And the 6 boards I was mentioning earlier, have allocated budgets for, if you want, eliminating any customers' arrears that they find along their ways to ensure we maximize customer satisfaction. In parallel with that, we are investing more in communication and advertising and being present above the line in our markets and also this has also started. And I see both elements, customer satisfaction and having allowed their voice as supportive of the commercial trends we were discussing earlier on. You mentioned proposition, and yes, a big part of the German turnaround is predicated in us being back in the market with stronger proposition in terms of product construct. You heard me mentioning in the past that we didn't have competitive family plans appropriately structured. We have now included this in our June drop, but there are many other propositions that we need to develop in Germany. And to give you, for example, a sense of 1 activity that is keeping us busy at the moment for after the summer is simplification of our tariff structure. In Germany, we still have multiple tariffs across our customer base. We have simplified our offers successfully in other markets. That hasn't happened yet in Germany. So we now have a list of at least 100 tariff products to simplify after the summer. So you're right, there are a number of activities which are IT dependent and will come into play, particularly in Germany, over the course of the coming quarters once we will be ready to execute.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A session for this morning. And I would like to hand back to Margherita for any closing remarks.\nMargherita Della Valle: Just to say thank you to everyone. Thank you for being with us today despite it being the end of July, and I wish you a pleasant summer. Thank you very much."
