Welcome to calendar 2024 and the second-half of our fiscal year. Open Text is more relevant than ever as we enter the new era of business AI. We have significant momentum as we transform into a cloud growth company, as we expand our mission in information management, and as we accelerate private and public cloud consumption. Artificial general intelligence is a once in a generational opportunity. And OpenText is in a very strong position to lead the way in information management. We continue to accelerate our investments in product, services, and go-to-market, and we are seeing the results. Q2 was a spectacular quarter and showcases our strategy and performance progress with the following. Record revenues of $1.3 billion or 71% year-over-year growth, strong organic growth, our 12 consecutive quarter of ARR growth in constant currency. Record enterprise cloud bookings of $236 million or 63% year-over-year growth, and we're just getting started. We are winning with cloud additions, our business clouds. We are winning with data security and trust requirements, SaaS and Micro Focus just coming online, as well as Business AI with OpenText Aviators. We had record adjusted EBITDA of $566 million, or 37%, and 66% year-over-year growth, and strong free cash flows of $305 million or 87% year-over-year growth. I'm so proud of our colleagues and partners. And this great success is enabled and powered by our innovation investments, strong customer momentum, and operational excellence. Let me highlight a few amazing customer partnerships. Carl Zeiss is leveraging the OpenText content cloud for a global information management platform and a single source of truth across the entire company, integrating business applications from SAP; Salesforce; and Microsoft into the OpenText cloud. Philips Healthcare is leveraging our OpenText Aviator platform; Vertica, for its mission-critical medical imaging system for high availability and proactive field maintenance to ensure patients receive optimal clinical performance. BMW has selected the OpenText cybersecurity cloud; Fusion, for what is called root of trust information management and data governance; FedEx Express, the world's largest cargo airline, has been a strategic partner with OpenText for over a decade and that partnership expands now by leveraging the OpenText IT operations Cloud or OpsBridge monitoring and autonomically responding to a very dynamic topology, ensuring the highest possible flexibility and resiliency and support of their mission. We had 48 cloud wins over 1 million in new contract value in Q2, with many impressive customer stories just like these. Today marks our first full-year of owning Microfocus. And our focus is on cloud growth, AI, customer success, and being number one in information management. Micro Focus contributed revenues of $601 million in Q2, and we should end the fiscal year with renewal rates in the high-80s. The amazing work from our colleagues and partners and with the trust of our customers, we were reshaped a shrinking business into a winning and growing innovator. We're doing exactly what we said we would do. Further, we're on track to complete the AMC divestiture by the end of the fiscal year, subject to standard regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, which will allow us to go even faster in AI in the cloud. We intend to use the proceeds to reduce net leverage to less than 3 times and ahead of schedule, providing us the flexibility to resume share buybacks and to pursue strategic M&A and to drive future cloud and AR organic growth. We have all the ingredients we need for a fantastic 2024 and to achieve our F26 aspirations of 7% to 9% cloud organic revenue growth. And with our strong cloud bookings growth of 63% this quarter, your visibility into our cloud growth increases. And as a reminder, and as we like to say, we're an annual business. So let me turn to our fiscal ‘24 outlook. We're maintaining a total cloud revenue outlook of $5.85 billion to $5.95 billion. We are raising our cloud bookings growth target to 25% to 30% growth, up from 15% plus. We're within our adjusted EBITDA range, but tightening the range to 36% to 37%, given our investments in cloud and security and AI. We have both medium and long-term opportunities to increase margin. But right now, our focus is driving bookings and cloud revenue growth. We're also raising the lower end of our free cash flow range. We now expect stronger full-year results of between $825 million to $900 million of free cash flow. And with our workforce optimization complete and the majority of the Micro Focus restructuring complete, our attention and energy are focused now on customer transformation, innovation and growth. Information automation plus AI will be an essential part of our competitive advantage. OpenText will completely embed AI in all our products. I've received very positive customer feedback on our Information Management Business Cloud, AKA Cloud Edition, and our Business AI, AKA Aviators. We are working with a major apparel company to apply AI's invoices, a major bank to detect fraud, a major manufacturer for complex compliance, and a major food company to consolidate billions of supply chain transactions and documents to create the next generation of sustainable foods. We are making strong and steady AI progress. We are differentiated in the market and we are winning business. Our differentiated advantages include managing active and large data sets. We believe in integrating automation and AI together, protecting data privacy, security and trust, focusing on AI assist and personas and being cost reasonable. We are clearly progressing from discussion to delivery and from vision to value. Aviators 23.4 and 24.1 are delivered and soon 24.2. We have 800 engineers working on AI, and we're delivering new capabilities now every 90-days. We have numerous customers in our Earn Your Wings program, and our bookings growth is benefiting from customers consolidating and preparing for AI. We built a powerhouse services organization, and we're ready to engage with customers for our talent to help them do AI transformations. And further, we're focused on enabling our engineers to go even faster with business AI. I'm announcing today that we've begun a significant internal AI transformation and how our engineers create open tech software. We're creating a new platform called Platform Athena that will be our trusted platform to generate software and to assist our engineers in creating our products. Athena will significantly accelerate our innovation, accelerate time to market, attract the next generation of talent, and raise our productivity and efficiency. Our first Athena-generated products are expected to be in the market with Cloud Editions 25.2, and we'll keep you updated along the way. Our Q2 results tell our story. Now let me conclude with saying how excited I am about the second-half of the fiscal year of our momentum in information management, cloud, AI, and information security and trust. There's so much runway ahead of OpenText for growth. Our investments are the fuel for that momentum. Our operational experience will help us realize higher profits and cash flows from those higher revenues, and our accelerated path to under 3 times leverage will create stronger capital allocation and capital return opportunities. The OpenText Cloud is an information cloud and great information management is a key ingredient to business AI. Trust is an essential element in automation and AI, and we're earning our customers' trust every day. This is why we were the first Canadian company to join Canada's voluntary code of conduct on the responsible development and management of advanced generative AI systems. And as I said last year, and you heard it here first, our customer's data is not our product. A big thank you to my OpenText colleagues, customers and partners for this momentum. I also want to thank our shareholders for their support of the Micro Focus acquisition. It is your capital, we manage that responsibility with the utmost care, and we are doing exactly what we said we would do, provide growth, cash flows, and returns. Our top core value OpenText is being deserving a trust and we look forward to your feedback and continued support. May the one that brings peace bring peace for all. Let me turn the call over to Madhu.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. So let me start with a few key points. In Q2, OpenText executed extremely well, with record Q2 revenues and cloud bookings at an all-time high, we have built an operations practice that strategically supports the foundation of a solid growing enterprise cloud business. During Q2, we also completed successfully our one-year commitments and delivery on Micro Focus to drive a creative integration. One-year anniversary of Micro Focus is today. Our outlook fully reflects the opportunity in front of OpenText and the rapid progress we have made in growing Micro Focus revenue profitability and free cash flows. Mark spoke to our Q2 results and let me share additional comments. Starting on page 23 of the investor presentation posted on our IR website for the slides titled Q2 fiscal ‘24 and trailing-12 months financial highlights, all references are in millions of USD and compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year and are on a reported basis unless stated otherwise. On a year-over-year basis, with Q2 cloud revenue of $450 million, up 10.1% and 9.2% in constant currency. Q2 ARR, annual recurring revenue of $1.15 billion, up 58% and 55.6% in constant currency, that represents approximately 75% of total revenue. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of enterprise cloud organic growth in constant currency and our 12th consecutive quarter of constant currency organic growth in ARR. Our license increased 168% year-over-year as reported and 163% in constant currency and this reflects the incremental contribution from Micro Focus and increase in the number of large deals and the granting of certain IP rights. And let me comment to the large deals. For cloud, we closed 48 deals greater than $1 million in the quarter versus ‘23 in the earlier period. For license, we closed 35 contracts greater than $1 million in the quarter versus ‘23 in the earlier period. For license, we closed 35 contracts greater than $1 million in the quarter versus 15 in the year earlier. The deal sizes reflect the strategic importance of OpenText and cloud booking strength as our customers prepare for AR. And moving to other financial metrics, GAAP net income of $38 million, primarily reflecting the increasing interest expense, amortization, and special charges related to the acquisition of Micro Focus, driving GAAP EPS of $0.14. GAAP gross margin of 73.6%, up from 70.8%, reflecting increased relative revenue contribution from a licensed business. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78.6%, up from 76%, also reflecting increased relative revenue contribution from licenses. Adjusted EBITDA of $566 million, an increase of 66.1% year-over-year and 61.2% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.9%. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Micro Focus to be on our adjusted EBITDA model by the end of the fiscal year. Adjusted EPS of $1.24 continues to reflect this progress. Our DSOs are 47 days, flat from Q2 of the prior year, and reflecting higher seasonal billings and consistent with our expectations. Our overall working capital performance remains strong, and Micro Focus continues to systematically perform higher on all working capital metrics. We generated a stellar $350.7 million in operating cash flows and $305.4 million in free cash flows during the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, please see page 25 of the investor presentation. We finished Q2 with $1 billion in cash. Our net leverage ratio was, as expected at 3.7 times for Q2. After the quarter closed, we made an additional January repayment of $175 million on our acquisition term loan. After this payment, our principal outstanding debt is $8.5 billion. On Micro Focus Integration, please refer to page 34 of our investor presentation, where we're delighted to share that OpenText is on or ahead of plan on every commitment relating to Micro Focus integration. I'm highlighting a few; accelerate Micro Focus cloud growth, which includes product and sales investment, as we saw strong cloud results in Q2. And return Micro Focus to organic growth. Another strong quarter with $601 million of revenues were able to accelerate return to organic growth in fiscal ’24; improving Micro Focus renewals is a key milestone for organic growth that on track for a high-80s renewal rate in fiscal ’24. Improving Micro Focus renewals is a key milestone for organic growth, but on track for high-80s renewal rate in fiscal ‘24. And lastly, Micro Focus will be on an operating model, both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flows during fiscal ‘24, making significant contributions. On page 35 of our investor presentation, we are providing a final one-year anniversary update to the financial integration framework. We have now actioned $370 million of our $400 million targeted savings initiatives. We're increasing our restructuring advisory and facility expense special charges by $20 million, but reducing expected technology, tax, and legal entity simplification costs by $100 million for a net reduction of $80 million. When combined with expected reduction interest expense following the AMC divest, there is increased visibility on the improvement in free cash flow we expect to see between now and our fiscal ‘26 aspirations. AMC update, let me spend a moment on application modernization and connectivity, AMC. The business continues to perform well and we're on track for a successful close in Q4 to divest AMC to rocket software. The net proceeds will reduce debt for a consolidated net leverage ratio of less than 3 times within 90-days of closing. Our dividend program, on February 1, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. The record date for the next quarterly dividend is March 1, 2024, and the payment date is March 20, 2024. So let me turn to our targets and aspirations, starting with our Q3 fiscal ‘24 quarterly factors on page 32 of our investor presentation. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. ARR, annual recurring revenue of $1.13 billion to $1.16 billion. We expect FX to be constant. Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year margin between 32% and 33% that reflects Micro Focus integration cost, and FX adjusted EBITDA to also be constant. Our fiscal ‘24 targets and constant currency are provided on page 33 of our investor relations presentation. As I build and Mark’s comments, I will also provide updates to the target model ranges to fully reflect our successful one-year integration of Micro Focus. Our cloud revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%. Customer support revenues are up 43% to 45% year-over-year, compared to our prior range of up 40% to 42%. ARR up 25% to 27% compared to our prior range of up 24% to 26%. Our license revenue up 68% to 70%, compared to our prior range of up 71% to 73%. And professional services revenue up 26% to 28%, compared to our prior range of about 29% to 31%. Total revenue growth of 30% plus with organic growth in the range of 1% to 2%. Total operating expenses of 42% to 44% of revenues. Non-GAAP gross margin range of 77% to 79%. We are tightening our adjusted EBITDA margin range to 36% to 37%, and that reflects higher investments in AI and cloud, sales and marketing, and expenses related to the AMC divestiture and Micro Focus integration expense. At current exchange rates, we expect FX to be $20 million to $40 million a tailwind. Net interest expense for the year to be $550 million to $570 million, and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 14%. As noted earlier, our enterprise cloud business is doing extremely well with solid revenue growth and 63% year-over-year bookings growth in the quarter, increasing our visibility. We are a key Microsoft partner, and as noted in their recent call, the SMB market is facing short-term challenges. This impacts our SMB business. We remain in a great position to continue to add products for SMB business and benefit as the environment improves. Turning to free cash flows, we expect free cash flow to grow year-over-year in both third quarter and fourth quarter. We're raising the lower end of our FCF range and now expect stronger, fuller results between $825 million to $900 million. Our fiscal ‘26 aspirations are included on page 36 of the investor presentation and remain unchanged from our materials we shared with you on November 28 when we announced the AMC divestiture. Our fiscal ‘26 aspirations show the highly predictable and growing business at scale led by cloud and ARR. So in summary, our OpenText team members have proudly delivered a solid Q2 and a strong first-half of the fiscal year, and we remain on track to meet our fiscal ‘24 targets and fiscal ‘26 aspirations. The Micro Focus integration is ahead of our commitments, and we expect Micro Focus to receive important milestones in fiscal ‘24, a return to organic growth and renewal rates to the high-80s and Micro Focus business to be on OpenText operating models for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flows. The AMC divestiture reinforces and sharpens our focus, sharpens our capital allocation, and over time will allow for more resources to be allocated to drive more growth. On behalf of OpenText, I would like to thank our shareholders, our loyal customers, and partners. I will now request the operator to open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Richard Tse With National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.\nRichard Tse: Yes, thank you. Madhu, I think you did talk about the SMB market. I'm not sure this is for Mark or Madhu, but wondering if you could sort of expand that and talk more broadly about the enterprise spending environment? It seems there's been some mixed messages out there as to whether it's kind of gone back to a normal pace or not?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, Richard, thanks for the question. Let me take a part of that. Look on the SMB part -- SMB is a massive part of the U.S. economy $370 billion in spend for companies with 1,000 employees or less. We believe information management is deeply relevant for this market. And as we know, Microsoft is a key partner in this space. Microsoft's recently discussed some of their short-term challenges in SMB, but they've also confirmed they're a long-term strategic driver for growth in SMB as well. So I think we're in a great position to benefit from SMB both in the medium and long-term and it will be a strong contributor to our 7% to 9% organic cloud growth aspirations. Now as it relates to maybe a little more on the macro side. Look, I'm going to combine any of the comments I had over to Madhu. I'll combine a little bit of macro and competitors. We are benefiting from customer demand as customers look to consolidate away from competitors that are stuck off cloud, they don't have a data security or trust platform, and have a weak AI vision and low capabilities to deliver. You know, we're in the right place today. You know, 60% of our business is in North America, public sector, energy, financial services, manufacturing, we're supporting CPG, apparel, retail. We got some fantastic ecosystem partners, Microsoft, SAP, Google, and Salesforce. So we're in the right places right now and it's about delivering value for customers. And so we see a reasonable economy out there to go execute.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, thank you, Mark. And Richard, I just wanted to highlight, specific to fiscal ‘24, again, you saw the enterprise cloud bookings growth rate of 63%. And we're also increasing the outlook for the year. For cloud revenues in fiscal ‘24, content revenue, analytics revenue, experience revenue, and business network, all doing very well. But we did want to call out the SMB as you look at the Q3 and the fiscal ‘24 targets for cloud revenue, per se.\nRichard Tse: Okay, great. And I just have a question on Aviator, no doubt that's probably one of your more exciting products right now. I don't know if it's too early still, but do you have any sort of sense at this point in time what a reasonable attach rate would be within your existing customer base and that sort of potential incremental revenue opportunity? And I guess on the same note, I think you had some sort of, I forgot what it was called, a trial at your annual user conference. Like, I’m wondering if you could sort of share any stats in terms of the uptake on that trial?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, sure, thanks. Thank you again, Richard. We're making strong and steady progress. And I'll just start with what differentiated in the market. And we have one business. Now, we're differentiated, as I noted in my prepared remarks, on the data sets that our automation create and we manage. We believe that our business cloud automation and AI are integrated. And I also said on my prepared remarks, we are embedding AI everywhere. It will be a capability, AI will live right next to automation in the long-term. You'll have your automation screen, but you'll have your AI assist right next to it. My best way to describe it is we're moving from vision to showing the value and discussion to delivery. We have numerous customers today in our Earn Your Wings program. I discussed a few in my remarks in food, in apparel, manufacturing. And if you look at our bookings growth of 63% year-over-year growth, we have AI wins in that. And also note that we raised our outlook on our bookings growth from 15% to 25% to 30%. So, you know, we're doing this the OpenText way. It is a strong vision backed up by product. We're delivering every 90-days. We're moving from that vision to showing value. We're moving from discussion to delivery. We have now progressed to just a fantastic bookings quarter and raising our outlook for the year on bookings. And we've moved to the next step, which is creating really a breakthrough idea on platform Athena on how we're going to transform how we write our own software using our own platform. So I'm pleased with our progress. We're going to keep making progress every 90-days. And I strongly believe that your visibility into our 7% to 9% cloud organic revenue growth significantly increases with this strong bookings outlook.\nRichard Tse: Okay, thank you, I'll pass the line.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Chan with TB Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Chan: Hi, thanks. Casual conversion really took a step up in the quarter. Q2 seems to be seemingly stronger for conversion anyway, but considering the ongoing integration, this seemed pretty good. Is there anything to call out on that performance and should we expect that to continue?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes. Thank you, Dan. So what I would say is that, as I've shared before, the OpenText cash conversion has remained very steady and strong. If you think about the elevation that we made with OpenText, we set out to do that with Micro Focus. What I would say is that in Q2, we saw Micro Focus also respond very positively, and the cash conversion that you're seeing is sort of right in there. Keep in mind they had different year ends and different quarters, and we're actually very delighted how we were able to converge their operating performance to our quarters, et cetera. Do we expect it to continue? Yes, we absolutely expect it to continue.\nDaniel Chan: Thanks, Madhu. And then on the EBITDA margin guidance for the full-year, tightened it up. But next quarter, I think it looks like it's going to take us down to 32% to 33%. Just wondering what's driving that?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, so if you recall, Q3 for us is usually a seasonally lower EBITDA quarter. There are big factors, I'd say, for the remainder of the year, as Mark and I both called out, that includes investment in AI and cloud, just given the strong bookings we see, and we do have some AMC divestiture experience, I mean, expenses, and also some micro-profit integration expense. But Q3, if I could just highlight, from an employee perspective, it's in January 1, a new year, we have higher benefits expense, we have higher sort of vacation expense, et cetera. So that is more seasonal to Q2, and that also weighs down a bit, the EBITDA margin. But for the year that 36% to 37% Q4 will remain a seasonally strong quarter.\nMark Barrenechea: And Dan, I think it's fair to say, as Madhu noted, that Q3 is a seasonally low quarter and Q4 is a seasonally stronger quarter.\nDaniel Chan: Okay, I appreciate that. The investments that you're making into cloud AI, where are the areas of focus for this added investment? Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, thank you, Dan. Well, you noted some of them. The -- we continue to build out our private cloud infrastructure, particularly around industry of compliance, data security, trust, privacy. It's an investment in our SaaS offerings. As we talk about how to unlock our future value, we have established our private cloud platform as a standard globally. The next step is more public cloud staff consumption across our products. And of course, aviator, our AI. So those areas where we're applying that investment. And doing that within the range we talked at the beginning of the year, even though we tightened it a little bit, we're still within the range we presented.\nDaniel Chan: Sounds good, thank you.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSteve Enders: Sure. Thanks for taking the question here. Maybe to start on the cloud booking experience in the core, I mean, pretty impressive results there. I guess what in particular kind of drove the upside there? Was it customers converting over, new use cases, how big of a contributor was this AI? And then I guess secondarily, do you think about the growth outlook and cloud bookings for the year, what kind of AI contribution that you're kind of embedding in that?\nMark Barrenechea: Steve, thanks for that question. As I said in my prepared remarks on the cloud side, clearly a very strong quarter, 63% year-over-year growth. And with our forward visibility, we see continued strength. And we raised our outlook from 15% cloud bookings growth to 25% to 30% cloud bookings growth for the year. What's driving that? First is we see a lot of customers continuing to move to our cloud and consolidating away from competitors, who can't get to the cloud, can't provide the data security and trust, don't have a credible AI vision, let alone first products in the market. So just continuous strength of our private cloud, customers consolidating, compliance, data security, trust, privacy remain top of the list for the global 10,000, that's the driver for us. And AI, we've won AI business. And it's showing up in our bookings. We're not breaking out AI or security and trust or content or BN of bookings at this point. We don't get down to that level. But AI was a clear contributor in that 63% cloud bookings growth and a factor in us raising our growth outlook for the year.\nSteve Enders: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe taking some of the puts and takes of the growth outlook, you know, like it’s good to see customer support step up and maybe just a little more I guess color on the license stepping down a little bit in the per services stepping down a little bit from the expectations from last quarter?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, so Steve, I'll take that. License in the quarter actually was significantly higher from a year-over-year basis. And the contribution there really is bringing Micro Focus into the play. As you recall, Micro Focus cloud momentum is strong, but they're still smaller from a cloud perspective in terms of bookings and revenue relative to, of course, OpenText. And PS revenues also grew in the quarter comparatively. I want to make sure I heard your question right. Both license and PS did grow in the quarter.\nSteve Enders: Yes, I guess I want to, yes, just clarify just on the outlook, because I think you said that both of those were down from the prior expectations from last quarter. So, just trying to understand for the annual outlook, why those two lows came down a little bit?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Sure, sure, I missed that part in your earlier comment. So the adjustment of the ranges really reflects the strength of, again, Micro Focus from a customer support perspective, right, and we've adjusted that to the range. And keeping the overall fiscal ‘24 target the same from a license perspective, just consider that we have our Q3 seasonality and license, and that applies to Micro Focus as well. But it's really the contributor there, I would say, is the better renewals for Micro Focus customer support. So we wanted to increase the range of the customer support and obviously account for some inherent volatility in the license business.\nSteve Enders: Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the questions there.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Sure. Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Krishnaratne with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Hey there just a couple of clarifications for me. So just on the cloud growth 6% to 8%, that was maintained. So I just want to read, is it just the fact that you've had the strong enterprise bookings, but they're still offset from SMB. Is that sort of the reason why that range was maintained?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, I'll take it first and turn it over to Mark. Thanks for the question. So think about the cloud bookings, as Mark mentioned, really increasing our visibility to the future, which would be fiscal ‘25 and fiscal ‘26. Our cloud contracts are long and we talked about that before and the time to deployment and to revenue are also long. But we're very delighted at the performance in the quarter just giving us that future forward visibility. So take India for fiscal ‘24, we're keeping it at 6% to 8% and within that, enterprise cloud revenue, analytics, experience, DN, all doing well. And as we called out SMB, it's weighing down a bit. So we want to kind of balance that and keep the revenues at 6% to 8%. And that revenue is really benefiting from our cloud bookings from our prior quarters, right? And the cloud renewal rates, et cetera. So I just want to separate the strength of the cloud bookings here, which is really going to be positively impacting ‘25 and ‘26, and just the factors outlining significant ‘24.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Got it, thanks for that. Just final other question here, just on the bookings. I know sometimes you've announced the bookings and there can be a little bit of a delay, I guess, in the translation to revenue. Is the AI-related bookings, do those look any different? Do you think that those are going to be translated from bookings to revenue at a faster pace, just given the sort of strong demand that your customers are seeing for the AI products?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, Kevin, thanks for that question. No, the bookings related to AI are following the same characteristics as an enterprise booking. And so in the SMB space, we tend to see one-year contracts. In the enterprise space, we tend to see two to four year contracts. And so AI is following that enterprise pattern, if you will. And as we do notice, that bookings number will have a clear impact, a positive impact, in ‘25 and ‘26. But right now it looks like our AI wins will follow our traditional enterprise pattern.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Got it. Great, thanks a lot, I'll pass the line.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Adhir Kadve with Eight Capital. Please go ahead.\nAdhir Kadve: Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to talk a little bit about, you know, last quarter you saw some initial bookings in AI, this quarter you called out some strengths there as well? I just want to ask how have customers really progressed in AI? Mark, you kind of mentioned that a lot of customers are still dipping their feet with the Get Your Wings program, but are some of those early customers, are they progressing faster to maybe more larger scale deployments or are they kind of still in the Get Your Wings program, get their feet wet type of deployment phase?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, Adhir. Thanks for the question. It's progressing and a couple why statements here. We're going to embed AI in all our products. It's clear that there's a path where you have your automation and you have the learning from data. And our approach is to provide AI assist. If we automate a healthcare professional, there should be an AI persona right next to that. We automate a tech support specialist, there should be an AI assist next to it. We automate a contract specialist or a loan specialist, there should be an AI assist next to it. So we're going to embed AI everywhere. It's a discussion in every RFP. In every RFP and some customers are in early stages of exploring. Some are medium, a handful are more advanced. But it's in every single discussion. So it is certainly sort of separating out in the market those competitors, who have not necessarily even moved to the cloud or let alone have the resources to deliver a robust AI platform. So we're seeing benefit from our very strong first waiver products and our vision, our skills now to be able to deploy a data management platform and to be able to vectorize and install a language model to be able to get customers in Earn Your Wings to actually be able to experiment either in the small or at scale, very differentiated in the markets, right? I called out our services organization that we've been investing in for a decade in building that service organization. So we're making steady progress. We've gone from a vision to a first set of beta products, to our first version, through our first delivery, first customers using and getting value, bringing our services organization to higher capability, to a very strong bookings growth, raising our booking outlook, and seeing now how we can apply it internally on what we think is a breakthrough platform called platform Athena. So I really like the progress that we're making.\nAdhir Kadve: Okay, excellent. And then I just wanted to touch on one comment you made that the customers are getting value. What are some early learnings from that value that customers are getting? How is it helping their organization using these AI products?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, I've given a few shout-outs in the script. One is particularly using our business network invoicing transactions and some of the wider network metadata to understand next generation of food and sustainability, going deep into contracts and understanding revenue opportunities and liabilities. But some of the early learnings are, one, you have to prepare, and you may need to consolidate systems. You may need to prepare your data a little bit. So preparation is important. Customers know what they want to do. There's not a lot of vagueness out there on what customers want to do, but they've got to prepare. Second is do not separate your automation and your AI. You take data out of your automation, it immediately rocks like a cabbage, because it gets dated. So I think that's another big learning. And customers want to do it economically. And with more open source language models, more skills, we're still staying on traditional processors, if you will, to manage cost, the customers want to do it reasonably. And this is just going to keep building on itself for Open Tech. So those are some of our learnings.\nAdhir Kadve: Excellent, thanks a lot [Indiscernible]. Pass the line.\nOperator: The next question is from Thanos Moschopoulos with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nThanos Moschopoulos: Hi, good afternoon. Regarding the AMC business, are you seeing any kind of impact in that business, stemming from the fact that you've publicly announced your plans to dispose of it, or? I think you're going to call out in that regard?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, Thanos, thanks for the question. No, steady as you go. These are products and customers who have been benefiting from decades of investment and understand the long-term nature of the platform and it's steady as we go.\nThanos Moschopoulos: Great and then just going back to the question regarding the slightly more conservative license outlook. Obviously, license is more volatile, it's hard to forecast, but is there anything else you would point to? Is it a function maybe of clients preferring a cloud deployment model to a greater extent than you were initially expecting, or anything else you would call out in that regard?\nMadhu Ranganathan: And, I mean, I'll take the first part, Thanos, in terms of the customer trends. We'll turn it over to Mark. Again, on the license, keep in mind Q3 has also been seasonally lower from a licensed standpoint, and that pattern also applies to Micro Focus in a licensed business, while the Micro Focus is doing very well, as I said, we are returning them to organic growth this year. So that's really the Q3 seasonality that we are actually calling out. And also we're seeing, you know, Micro Focus do very well with the renewal rates, et cetera. So really we wanted to expand the customer support line, those ranges there, and keeping our annual revenue, you know, within the range and accounting for more the license volatility is really what you see in the ranges. I'll also share that in my commentaries, we shared the number of over a million dollar deals both in the cloud side, as well as on the license side and both remain very strong, right? It's more the Q3 seasonality that you're seeing into the annual ranges. Does any of the comments Mark want to share?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, sure. License has a role. And we work in very secure environments. We work in deeply regulated environments and environments that have very high bar on compliance. We want a fantastic nuclear platform that requires license in a private cloud. We want many customer security, DoD, and other community platforms that require licenses as well. But what's clear through time is that license has a role and it's going to have a role in certain types of regulatory and deeply compliant environments, environments that require the utmost trust and security has a role in the private cloud as well. We've sort of found our natural level in our licensed business. So, Thanos, it has a role. And it's also a place where we can integrate to our hybrid cloud strategy. And a hybrid cloud strategy also means SaaS and private cloud. So we're in the licensed business. It's got a role. But the role is clearer today than it was five years ago.\nThanos Moschopoulos: [Indiscernible] thanks.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes. Thank you, Thanos.\nOperator: The next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. This is Jeremy on Raimo. So just on Micro Focus, maybe focusing on the product side, can you speak a bit to which areas of the business are seeing most interest at the moment, whether it be idle, Vertica, or maybe some of the security products? Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, we happy too. Thank you, Jeremy. So, look, it's been a great year one, and we're on to year two. Today marks the first year anniversary. And if you'll just allow me, we were shaped a shrinking business and formed it into an innovative, growing one. And it was a first, it was a fantastic first year. I want to thank everyone for their support. In terms of innovation and growth, let me provide a few shout outs. ITOM, our IT operations management, it's all about the next generation of products around observability and extending service management outside of the IT environment to corporate-wide service management. That's our priority. In terms of security, it's about bringing it into SaaS, identity management, and to edge computing. It's about ADM and having that end-to-end life cycle. And our platform, Athena, has many components from ADM. So getting -- bringing AI -- business AI and Aviators into the developer experience. We introduced a new IoT platform based on core Vertica and something called the GPAC modules. You can find it on our website. And we're very excited to bring in higher scale machine transaction data into our information cloud. And then of course all things cloud. Private cloud, SaaS, and AI embedded across ITOM, security, ADM, IoT. I'll also note in my comments of our 63% cloud bookings growth, and I raised outlook for the year to 25% to 30% cloud bookings growth. Microsoft, I keep calling them Microsoft, so we didn't buy Microsoft, we bought Micro Focus. I noted that Micro Focus cloud bookings contributed to that 63% growth as well and will begin to contribute more over time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Thank you, I did not announce our acquisition of Microsoft today, so just to be clear. Yes, thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephanie Price with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Price: Good afternoon, Mark. You mentioned M&A, so some people will go there. Not Microsoft, but you did mention strategic M&A in your prepared remarks. So how should we think about the balance between M&A and organic investments and insurer-holder capital return here post the AMC divestiture?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, sounds great. Thank you, Stephanie. Well, look, we're excited to complete the divestiture. And as I noted, we're on track, you know, subject to closing additions and regulatory approvals. And we expect to close by the end of our fiscal year. And when we do so, our intent is to de-lever and bring our leverage under 3 times and to return to a full-stack capital allocator. As you'll see in the investor materials, we're looking to return 30% of our, approximately 30% of our free cash flow via dividends and buyback. And that allows 70% of our available capital available for other purposes including M&A. And you should expect us to return to M&A. So that M&A will be strategic. It will be focused on ARR and cloud assets that drive future organic growth.\nStephanie Price: Okay, thank you. And then I also want to circle back on the investments in AI cloud and security. Should we think, assume these investments continue post fiscal ‘24, and how should we think about R&D as a percentage of revenue going forward from here?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, absolutely, I'll take that Stephanie. So today we're actually looking at, we actually called out R&D as a percentage of revenue at 14% to 16%. So at the larger scale, expect that to continue. In terms of AI investments, it's both, it's R&D and sales and marketing. And for fiscal ‘24, it is 18% to 20%. So I would say expect us to keep in that range, obviously, at the scale the dollars will be higher as well. And also the deployment of R&D, as Mark mentioned, 800 engineers deployed towards AI and related activities. So the teams are spending a lot of time not just on the investments, but where the investments are going.\nStephanie Price: Great. Thank you very much.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes. And thank you, Stephanie, and just to amplify a point from Madhu, platform Athena, so it's going to significantly raise our productivity and output. And this is, I look through two decades, three decades of leading engineering organizations and how they've evolved over time and how organizations like OpenText have looked to balance our incredible talent globally and through automation and through systems, through open source wave, through better tools. There's another wave coming, which is called AI. And some companies will use it, while some may stumble along the way. For us, we have a very clear vision and we're going to be building our proprietary platform internally to manage roughly a billion lines of software and how to auto-generate cases, how to auto-generate interfaces to APIs, how to accelerate learning. I think the talent we hire in the future in engineering is going to be radically different and radically elevated. Athena will be able to take descriptions and generate code. So that next wave of efficiency, and we'll talk more about that when we get to our F ‘25 plan, that in the R&D expense percent, the nature of this in large scale tech companies are going to change, because there's a very interesting wave of AI coming and how we're going to be building software.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, and Stephanie, if I could just add one more, R&D is a very broad category, just given our spectacular cloud bookings growth, and we talked about visibility into ‘25 and ‘26. We are also investing in what we call information security, the CECL organization. We are also investing in cloud operations and cloud infrastructure and sort of hyperscale a cost. So I did want to mention in terms of investments, it's going sort of above the line and below the line as well.\nStephanie Price: Great, thank you for the color.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you.\nOperator: The Next question is from Paul Treiber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Your recent comments on Athena were very helpful to understanding what it is, and using AI to improve the productivity of your R&D teams, do you expect or do you see improving productivity across the entire organization through AI over the next several years. Is that something that we could expect going forward?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, Paul, good to hear your voice and thanks for being on the call, absolutely. And as I noted, we have room to improve our margin right now. We're focused on bookings and revenue growth. And I only decided on the call today to go into one area, very large area for us, a transformative area for us, which is the core of the company. We're an engineering firm, right? And we create IP and products. But when we look across the entire company, we have other projects that we're working on and that will come to fruition in the coming years in increased productivity in the support organization, in the pre-sales organization, in the renewals organization. So we can talk more about where we look to deploy them, but I wanted to be very grounded in kind of the first transformative area that we have our concrete plans are. And it's sort of a multiply, it's a force multiplier to be able to get our engineering team more productive, next generation of talent, accelerating product to market. We think that's the area that will have the nearest term and highest impact.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks. And then just a second question, just more specifically on the outlook for ‘24. And when you look at Q4, you can back into what it implies for Q4 EBITDA margins. I think the midpoint is at about 41.5% EBITDA margins, which is quite high and it's close to an all-time high for the company. What is driving that seasonality to the upside? We talked a lot about Q3, but how do we think about Q4, the drivers there?\nMadhu Ranganathan: No, Paul. Thank you, it's Madhu here. It's a very important question. So a couple of things, one I spoke about the Q3 seasonality, which is actually very typical. So again, at the Uber level, we are making investments, but Q3 has its own seasonality in terms of people spend, payroll spend, benefit, et cetera. So Q4 is our seasonally strong quarter from a revenue perspective, and you will see that benefit the EBITDA margin as well. And some of the integration expenses we have for Micro Focus for this fiscal year, some of the spend is focused in Q3, we look to optimize some of those in Q4. So I would say the big contributor to Q4 EBITDA margin is going to be our seasonally strong revenue quarter and tapering off of some of the expenses. And you're absolutely right for the second-half of the year, Q4 EBITDA margin will be much stronger than Q3 to get to our annual range.\nPaul Treiber: All right, thanks for taking the questions.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, thanks Paul.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you.\nOperator: I'll now hand the call back over to Mr. Barrenechea for closing remarks.\nMark Barrenechea: Very good. Thank you, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We're just delighted with our progress and our momentum. You heard us, we're investing for growth. We're expanding our competitive advantage, strong financial update, and we're focused on capital return. In the room today as well is Greg Secord, and we'd like to wish him a happy birthday, yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining. And Madhu, myself, Harry, and Greg, we look forward to engaging in the coming days and weeks. That ends today's call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day."

And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to Mark.\nMark Barrenechea: Harry, thank you. Thank you for joining us today. It's an exciting start to our new fiscal year 2024. We had record Q1 revenues of $1.43 billion, double-digit cloud revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA of 34.7%. It was another quarter of cloud organic growth, ARR organic growth and strong renewal rates in the mid-90s. Customers showed tremendous trust and confidence in OpenText during the quarter. Bombardier chose OpenText for their legal tech AI platform. CNP chose OpenText for large contract AI analysis. And Infosys chose OpenText for developer testing, automation, and generation. Great information management is a prerequisite for great AI, and we intend to compete in and win both information management, automation, and AI. The OpenText business is best analyzed and measured on annual performance. We manage the business to longer cycles than 90 days, thus our quarters do vary. Based on our strong Q1, our strong product cycle and forward visibility, we have confidence in our F24 constant currency targets, $5.85 billion to $5.95 billion in revenues, 36% to 38% adjusted EBITDA, $800 million to $900 million in free cash flows, including total revenue organic growth, 15% plus enterprise cloud bookings growth and returning micro focus to organic growth. We are shifting from growth primarily driven by M&A to growth driven by product innovation and go-to-market execution. You can see our new total growth model with our F26 aspirations on Slide 21 of our investor relations deck. It includes 15% plus enterprise cloud bookings growth, 7% to 9% cloud revenue growth, 2% to 4% ARR growth, plus any future M&A and margin expansion, plus dividends and buybacks. And when all combined, yields return to shareholders. We are focused on the fundamentals that drive shareholder value. Slide 13 of our investor deck highlights our new shareholder value approach and how we intend to create value through six fundamentals. First, expand our competitive differentiation and information management, expand customer consumption, unlock new value areas such as SaaS and AI, expand our go-to-market, realize higher profit and cash flows from those higher revenues and continue to return capital to shareholders via our dividend programs and future share buybacks. Let me walk you through each one of the value drivers. Competitive advantage is everything. We offer the most comprehensive information management platform in the market, affording customers many paths to value, and paving the way for new value as the world embraces AI. And to accelerate these outcomes, we expect to invest up to 16% of revenues in R&D and we expect these investments to support our F26 growth aspirations of 7% to 9% organic cloud growth. Second, expanding our customer consumption is a threefold strategy. First, by being the market leader in each of our business clouds, and driving more consumption within each content, experience, business networks, applications, automation, IT operations, and security. Second, by embedding security and content across all of our business clouds. And third, by providing customers choice and continuing to provide them choice. Off cloud, private cloud, public cloud, API cloud. We provide the flexibility to prepare to pair the right workload with the right consumption approach. So our customers can focus on the right model for their business. Third value driver. We have new value areas to unlock, very focused in SaaS and AI. While we're executing well overall and we have many programs to enhance value, we are very focused on unlocking new value from SaaS and AI. Titanium was SaaS driven. Titanium X is both AI and micro focus cloud driven. Expect us to spend disproportional time in these areas. And for Q2, we expect to see 20% year-over-year growth in enterprise cloud bookings, another positive sign of unlocking new value. We will expand our go-to-market. We have one of the largest enterprise sales forces in software that we enter F24 with clear market lanes and resource across strategic accounts, enterprise accounts, corporate and business accounts, as well as the home. We are making it easier for customers to connect with our products to consume more. Over 500 partners attended OpenText World as we relaunched our partner network, focused on cloud and AI. And you can already see our progress within strategic accounts such as Microsoft and SMB. SAP, an enterprise business applications, Google with cloud infrastructure and AI, and AWS with mainframe modernization. A remarkable level of interest in our long-term strategy. We also intend to realize higher profits and higher free cash flows from higher revenues. With our expanded mission and information management and greater operational scale, this provides us greater opportunity to automate and to use AI to drive even greater operational synergies. Higher revenues and higher EBITDA translates to increased cash flows, which is reflected in our F'26 aspirations of adjusted EBITDA of 38% to 40% a $1.5 billion plus in free cash flows. And we anticipate the operating leverage in future years to only get stronger as well. And finally, capital allocation as a strategic value driver. Our capital allocation principle is to upturn approximately 20% of trailing 12 month free cash flows via dividends. Since fiscal '13, we have returned $2.2 billion via dividends and share buybacks. And we expect that as our free cash flows grows, so do our dividends. And as our net leverage decreases below 3x, we would expect to return to our share buyback program. This is our new growth model and our new value creation approach as we shift from growth primarily driven by M&A to growth driven by product innovation and go-to-market execution. Let me close on a few points. OpenText is in a great position to help our customers build the next generation of work, the next generation of experience, the next generation of service management, business fabrics, and supply chains. And to do this with highest levels of trust and security. And excited by our growth agenda helping customers modernize their businesses and their information platform, helping them consolidate customer data into our information cloud, providing cyber tools to create trust and security, consuming more SaaS applications. Helping developers be more productive and at the highest levels of quality and building AI platforms for humans. The promise of AI starts with great information management. Our Aviator AI software is built into our business clouds. Aviator platform embedded into our automation with pluggable language models. Aviator Thrust building smarter applications, Aviator Search, interacting with information in whole new ways, Aviator IoT embracing the next generation of device generated information in our individual Aviator Business Clouds. We are already working with customers to create exciting new AI personas via Aviator, such as the next generation tech supported system, a mortgage advisor, a claims adjuster, an HR business partner. As well, we're working with customers to simply get more efficient via AI. You can start to see us unlocking AI value with our expected Q2, 20% year-over-year growth in enterprise cloud bookings. Far shift to a new total growth model, driven by innovation with emphasis on high quality growth will enable us to deliver strong metrics for profitability and cash flows at scale. Our six fundamentals of new shareholder value will uniquely position us as a choice investment in the technology sector. My deepest appreciation to our 24,000 colleagues at OpenText who live our mission every day to make our customers widely successful. Our hearts pray for the hostages and innocent everywhere. And we joined the global community in the hope of a peaceful and prosperous future for the Middle East region. May the one that brings peace bring peace for all. Let me turn the call over to Paul Duggan, our Chief Customer Officer, who will speak to our renewal business, which grew organically in Q1. And Paul will hand the call over to Madhu, our CFO, who'll speak to our financials and outlook. Over to Paul.\nPaul Duggan: Great. Thank you, Mark. It's a privilege to be with all of you today to talk about our renewals business and a work for doing to unlock value for our customers and shareholders. Before I do, let me tell you about my team, the customer success organization were responsible for renewals of cloud and off cloud subscriptions, professional services and cloud delivery, and technical support. We brought these functions together following the Micro Focus acquisition, and took on an enhanced mission called OpenText, love, land together, operate, value, expand. OpenText love means focusing on customer outcomes. It's all about turning promises made into promises delivered. When it comes to renewals, we believe if you deliver on those promises, customers succeed. And when they succeed, they stay with you and those relationships will grow over time. Today, I'll speak to three areas, the strength of our renewals, an update on Micro Focus, and a few of the goals ahead for our team. First, OpenText has a strong record of maintaining exceptional and predictable renewal performance. Despite historic and disruptive world events, economic uncertainties and unprecedented strategies of the last decade, our renewal rates are unwavering. Q1 was no exception finishing at 94% for cloud and off cloud, excluding Micro Focus. Of course, renewal rates directly correlate to the value of products and services to our customers, but it's also a measure of operational excellence. From our renewal systems, processes, and controls to pricing and programs, to the automation simplifying the transactional elements. Collectively, these also create a lifting force on renewal rates and help us protect and grow ARR over time. It's not just renewal rates either. All of our primary indicators are trending positively on time renewals, past due contracts, cancellations, pricing at the point of sale, and our annual price adjustment at renewal. These trends are the hallmarks of customer confidence and a tightly run world class renewal function. Second, as we've shared before, raising the renewal rate on Micro Focus is a critical value unlocker. We started on day one of the acquisition, immediately bringing the business onto our internal standards. We also implemented a risk identification and mitigation playbook, growth programs like an extended support offering and deep engagement with our sales and engineering leadership to shape overall consumption and expansion strategies. By the end of Q2, all have touched roughly 75% of the Micro Focus Cloud and Off-Cloud subscriptions, we expect to touch 90% by Feb 1. As a result, we'll increasingly see the positive impacts of running the business in all the ways I described. And I'll give you two proof points on that impact. One, back in February, we took on a business operating in the low 80s on renewal rate. Q1 ended in the mid-80s, and it gives us now two consecutive quarters of improvement. We remain confident we'll end in the high 80s this year and expect to operate in the 90s in fiscal '25. Two, we did it for Documentum, taking renewals from the low 80s to the mid 90s where we are today. And now we are doing it for Micro Focus. And finally, looking to the future, it's all about growth. We already have a successful cloud renewal expansion motion in business networks and SMB. We're adding new offerings like a premium support upsell on our OpenText installed base, taking a very successful offering within the Micro Focus business, understanding the profile of customers that consume it, and extending that to similar OpenText customers. We also announced a new customer renewal portal last month, more than 90% of our Cloud Renewal business is auto renewed. And with this new portal, we'll bring an automated and self-service option to our off-cloud customers as well. As we do that, we plan to shift more renewal professionals to customer management versus renewal management and drive expansion across the entire customer base. Our overarching goal is to position renewals and the entire customer success organization to play a more prominent role in consumption, AI adoption, and public cloud expansion. Let me close by saying thank you to our customers. Success to the team support and a fantastic results we saw in Q1 ultimately represent your trust in OpenText. That trust is earned, not given, and we're committed delivering on the promises we make to you every day. And with that I'll hand the call over to Madhu.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you, Mark, and thank you, Paul. We appreciate all of you joining us today. So let me summarize the key points for today. In regarding Micro Focus, we expect to return Micro Focus to organic growth this fiscal year driven by successful integration. And in particular today, we all receive an excellent overview on renewals from Paul. In addition, we're delighted to share that we expect Micro Focus to be on our target operating model of 36% to 38% adjusted EBITDA this fiscal year as well. In Q1, OpenText executed extremely well in a volatile world with record Q1 revenues and year-over-year growth. Turning to our Outlook. Our outlook fully reflects the performance we expect bringing together two businesses with different seasonality trends and close cycles. With Q1 actuals and Q2 quarterly factors, we remain on target for our internal plan. We expect a stronger second half and a seasonally strong Q4 at the end of fiscal year, including a return to organic growth for Micro Focus. These are important factors for our quarterization and we encourage the analysts to better balance your quarterly models. We remain fully on track to meet our fiscal '24 targets and fiscal '26 aspirations. You are hearing today that we're shifting from growth primarily driven by M&A to growth driven by product innovation and go-to-market execution. This is our new total growth model with our fiscal '26 aspirations led by cloud and ARR. My final summary point will remain highly committed to shareholder value. And today, we're sharing with you our new shareholder value approach through six fundamentals that Mark outlined earlier. So moving to our Q1 results, please refer to the investor presentation as posted on our IR website. Starting on Page 24 of the presentation for the slide titled Q1 fiscal '24 and trailing 12 month financial highlights, all references I will be making are in millions of USD and compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year and are on a reported basis unless stated otherwise. On a year-over-year basis, enterprise cloud bookings of $121 million, up 8% year-over-year. We had record Q1 cloud revenue of $451 million, up 11.5%, and 10.9% in constant currency. Q1 ARR revenue of $1.15 billion up 59.1% and 57.5% in constant currency, and this represents over 81% of total revenue. This is 11th consecutive quarter of organic growth in constant currency for both cloud and ARR. It's record Q1 total revenue of $1.43 billion up 67.3% and 65.4% in constant currency with micro focus contributing $563 million in the quarter. And moving to other financial metrics, GAAP net income was $80.9 million and this reflects increased operating expenses, amortization, special charges, and interest expenses related to the acquisition of Micro Focus driving GAAP EPS of $0.30. GAAP gross margin of 71.4%, up from 69.7% and this reflects increased relative revenue contribution from customer support and license. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.3% up from 75.2%, also reflecting increased relative revenue contribution from license and customer support. Adjusted EBITDA of $495 million, an increase of 62.8% year-over-year and 58.2% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.7%. We expect Micro Focus on to our adjusted EBITDA model by the end of this fiscal year. Adjusted EPS of $1.01 continues to reflect this progress. Turning to DSO, our DSOs of 43 days down slightly by two days compared to Q4 given Q1 seasonal factors. Micro Focus continues to perform well and our overall working capital performance remains strong. As stated in our last call, we expected Q1 free cash flows to be neutral to slightly negative as a result of interest, special charges, and integration costs as with a seasonally lower working capital to start the fiscal year. We generated $47 million in operating cash flows and $10 million in positive free cash flows in the quarter. Starting from Q2, we expect free cash flows to grow on a year-over-year basis in each subsequent quarter. We remain on track to realize our fiscal '24 FCF targets of $800 million to $900 million and achieve our fiscal '26 aspirations. Now turning to the balance sheet, please refer to Page 26 of investor presentation. We finished Q1 with $920 million in cash, and $8.9 million of total long-term debt. Our net leverage ratio was 3.6x for the quarter. In Q3, and in our last call, We mentioned the net leverage ratio would fluctuate slightly over the next few quarters, while we remain on the path to a net leverage ratio of less than 3x by the end of fiscal 2025 or sooner. We have completed approximately $560 million of debt repayment since the close of Micro Focus transaction. Our revolver is now fully paid, and we have begun to make discretionary principal payments on the term loan. Turning to our dividend program on November 1st, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. The record date for the next quarterly dividend is December 1, 2023, and the payment date is December 20, 2022. And let's turn to our targets and aspirations. As Mark highlighted for Q2, we expect enterprise cloud bookings to grow 20% year-over-year. And let me comment on the SMB market. The SMB market has been the most impacted by the current macro environment. This trend has an impact on our cloud revenues, not on enterprise cloud bookings. During Q2, we expect to have $10 million to $15 million revenue headwind from SMB. Our enterprise cloud business remains strong and expected to grow revenues organically in Q2 and the rest of the fiscal year. As the SMB market gains more strength, we are well positioned to capture share and accelerate cloud revenue growth. Starting with our Q2 fiscal '24 quarterly factors of our investor presentation. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.50 billion, ARR of $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion. FX revenue tailwind of approximately $10 million to $15 million. Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, the margin between 36% and 37% and reflects Micro Focus integration costs. FX adjusted EBITDA tailwind of approximately $5 million to $10 million. Our fiscal '24 targets in constant currency are provided on page 30 of the Investor Relations presentation. Mark's [indiscernible] fiscal '24 target in his comments, and let me provide a full summary. Total revenues of $5.85 billion to $5.95 billion, enterprise cloud bookings growth of 15% plus, cloud revenues up 6% to 8%. Customer support revenues up 40% to 42%, ARR up 24% to 26%, total revenue growth of 30% plus with organic growth in the range of 1% to 2%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 77% to 79%, total operating expenses of 42% to 44% of revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% to 38%. Two changes to our fiscal '24 targets. At current exchange rates, we expect FX to be neutral, but also reducing our net interest expense for the year to be $550 million to $570 million and this reflects a 75 basis point reduction in the interest on our acquisition term loan. Our free cash flows are on track to achieve $800 million to $900 million which is our fiscal '24 target range. Our fiscal '26 aspirations remain unchanged. These are included in page 32 of our investor presentation materials. We are reaffirming fiscal 26 FCF aspirations of $1.5 billion plus. We expect to realize higher adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flows from higher revenues and let me put these in numbers for you. And relative to fiscal '23, our fiscal '26 aspirations show revenues to be 40% higher, adjusted EBITDA to be 67% higher and free cash flow to be 129% higher. Our fiscal '26 aspirations show a highly predictable and growing business at scale led by cloud and ARR. Acquisitions will remain additive to our future growth as we delever and capital flexibility returns. Lastly, please refer to our financial integration framework slide on page 31, we have updated to reflect timing on system integration and global entity simplification. So in summary, our Micro Focus integration is ahead of plan, and we expect to achieve important milestones in fiscal 2024. It's a return to organic growth, and renewal rate to the high 80s and Micro Focus business to be on the OpenText operating model of adjusted EBITDA of 36% to 38%. Also, as Mark mentioned, our shift to a new total growth model, driven by innovation, with emphasis on high quality growth will enable us to deliver strong metrics for profitability and cash flows at scale. Our six fundamentals of new shareholder value approach will uniquely position us as a choice investment in the technology sector. Our OpenText team members have proudly delivered a solid Q1 kicking off of fiscal 2024. On behalf of OpenText, I would like to thank our shareholders, our loyal customers and partners. I will now request the operator to open the call for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Pardon me. We're experiencing some technical difficulty. Please stand by. My apologies. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Richard Tse with National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.\nRichard Tse: Hi, yes, thank you. Can I ask Paul a question here?\nPaul Duggan: Richard, go right ahead.\nRichard Tse: Okay. Paul, so from your vantage point, you'll actually been in the role and been successful at, like, what do you think has been the biggest, I guess, most meaningful driver to increasing micro focuses renewal rate here?\nPaul Duggan: Hi, Richard. Great. Thank you for the question. Look, I think it's -- it comes down to three things. First, we move fast to get micro focus on our OpenText practices for Renewals, that discussed in my prepared remarks. Second, that also meant moving quickly to integrate the teams doing the work, getting renewals, doing renewals, and sales doing sales. And we believe that when those lines are not clear, renewal rates tend to underperform. And I'd say, third, as I speak to customers, I think that they also see our product roadmap and the other thing is we've unveiled in terms of our AI path, and they recognize that information management is becoming really a gating factor to fully embracing those step function. So I think all of those plays significant role in the decision to renew. And we can already empirically see that in the Renewal rates, in the improvement we've made since February.\nRichard Tse: Okay, great. Thanks. So, Mark, your recent OpenText world was a great event. Certainly, a ton of excitement around Aviator. What's sort of been the fall through, since the events last month and maybe kind of give us a sense of the momentum from a product perspective?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, thank you, Rich. And as I said in my notes, the -- continue -- the product cycle customer engagement clarity of our ability to provide a practical value. All fed into our comments today in the call of increasing our bookings outlook for the quarter of 20% year-over-year growth. So we're definitely getting to the next phase of engagement, to specific use cases. Product delivery in October. It's just November. It's November 2nd or 3rd. So it's somewhere early November. We have the next wave of product delivery in January. We've engaged with customers with fantastic feedback from OpenText World, including 500 partners who were -- who are with us in Vegas. And we're getting -- we're in engagements now, and we're going to win our first business. And, you're going to see it reflected first in bookings and thus our 20% year-over-year growth expectations for the quarter.\nRichard Tse: Okay. And then just a last one for me. Certainly appreciate the shift here to an organic growth focus, but I imagine you still have a fairly robust M&A team evaluating transactions. And so I'm just kind of curious, given the backdrop today. What's your sense of the acquisition landscape, perhaps from an evaluation standpoint? And if you came across like a great opportunity, would you be in a position you think to move on something within the next 12 to 18 months?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, thanks, Richard. I have the organization focused on a singular, powerful concept information management. It's a $200 billion market. We are transitioning from M&A driven growth to organic growth. And that starts with a rich product pipeline unlocking value in the cloud, new value areas of SaaS and AI. And that is a new -- that is an enhanced motion for us, with expectations of 20% year-over-year growth in our enterprise bookings. So that's what we'll focus on a singular, powerful concept, and we'll remain focused on a singular, powerful concept. For sure. If we find an opportunity like we did recently, we're climatic, that can enhance a specific aspect of our product, in the context of our strategy, we won't be bashful at all. But we're focused on the singular, powerful concept in our expanded mission and information management and being driven primarily by organic growth.\nRichard Tse: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMark Barrenechea: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thanos Moschopoulos with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nThanos Moschopoulos: Hi, good afternoon. Also a question for Paul. So just to be clear, what remains on maximizing the renewals of Micro Focus is a primarily question of going through, the annual renewal cycle with all the customers, or are there still some key steps that seem to be done internally to really drive that organization to its potential?\nPaul Duggan: Yes. Great question. It's a number of things. So, the -- you nailed the first one, right? We actually got to get to each of the renewals. And like I had said in my remarks, it'll be mostly there by February. And look, I think the step functions for us for there are really, kind of going to be value driven, the product roadmap, the conversations we're having around that. I think those are the things that really go into decision points on renewal. The things that we see today are really in large part decisions that were made 12 months ago. So you got to go rewind the clock back and look at the product roadmap at that time and look at what was out in front of the customers at that point. So there's going to be some run out here, I think of, we're going to get these initial improvements and benefits from all the systems and all the processes and those sorts of things. And then the longer end of this is going to be all about the intrinsic value of our offering. And you start with Documentum, like I've mentioned, we started a very similar place, low 80s. It the document benefit is running ahead of our average renewal rate. So we're in the mid 90s and we've been there for some time. So, it's -- there's confidence in our playbook. We've done it before. There's a scale with this, but it's still it comes down to these fundamentals.\nThanos Moschopoulos: Great. And then, Mark, just in terms of integrating the go-to-market, it sounds like you've done the heavy lifting for integrating your internal teams. But as far as integrating the Micro Focus and OpenText channels, where does that stand? How much opportunity it remains on that front and when do you start to start capitalizing some of that?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes. Thank you, Thanos. Thanks for the question. Yes, certainly our direct sales forces are fully integrated and fully aligned as we kicked off the fiscal year. We have -- in the investor deck, I think is Slide 18. Where we talked about that fact segmentation, really important. We really matured as we've scaled up to our current revenue letter levels are looking well beyond the near, in the full coverage out into the global 10,000. We now have very formal segmentation. And it's the segment, it very well aligned to how Oracle thinks in the world, SAP, Microsoft, we're now in that category, strategic accounts, enterprise accounts, corporate accounts, business accounts, and home accounts, very well defined stratification, very defined go-to-market. We are one sales organization, pursuing that those market areas. Where we have more work to do is on the partner network that we launched in July. We partner networks by definition, their network. So they got a lot of tentacles that go out over many, many years. We announced what -- where our landing zone, for all our partners, including Micro Focus partners of deal registration. We announced where they can engage on selling cloud. We began the AI discussion with them and where we want to be kicking off July 1 next year. Take systems, takes contracts, fixed execution, but we announced where we want to land come July 1. So there's a little work to do there between here in November and June, July -- June of next year. But on the direct enterprise side, we're fully aligned we're united. We're one organization. We have one organization on the new partner network, and we defined our landing zone of where we want to be July 1, announce different partners. We're working on all the details behind it. So that's the remaining work, Thanos.\nThanos Moschopoulos: Great. Thanks, Mark. I'll pass the line.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Treiber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Just the -- your outlook to achieve 20% cloud bookings growth this quarter is great. And it seems like an inflection from Q1, which is only 8%. Is that the right way to characterize it? Is that new AI products are likely to drive an inflection and growth for OpenText or is that reading too much into it? And there's maybe just quarterly dynamics between Q1 and Q2?\nMark Barrenechea: Paul, thanks for the question. Thanks for your first question to me. So I appreciate that. Just kidding. So, no our 20% bookings growth, we're going to see our first AI bookings, in that number. So AI is going to contribute. As we talked about two quarters ago, we announced our direction. We have a strong history over a decade of innovation in AI. We presented for customers how to get practical value. We announced our roadmap. Now we've delivered Wave 1. We're delivering Wave 2. And it's being very well understood where we can start to unlock value across our platform being built in, our trust services, search, IoT and each of the Aviator business clouds. And it's interesting, kind of a new language we're hearing from customers and we're helping them get there. Is that through our business clouds, we're helping them build these AI personas. So they have contract administrators today but now they're going to go the AI persona of the contract administrator, or mortgage advisor or technical support assistance. Now that 20% expected bookings growth year-over-year has AI contribution to it. And look, our Q1 is always seasonally light. And that's just it's our Q1. I know it's the world's Q3, but it's our Q1. And so our customers are trained that way. But that number reflects our next set of wins in AI. And I can't wait to present them to you.\nPaul Treiber: And you've had product releases and product cycles in the past. You sound quite enthusiastic about AI. Could you give us some context around, how customer interest and the sales pipeline for your new AI products compare versus previous product releases?\nMark Barrenechea: Well, sure. I think this is, I'd say two things. The first is I don't have to spend a dollar of marketing on AI. The whole world talked about it. So that's sort of an interesting new dynamic, right. So customers are proactively engaging. The world is very focused on generative AI. We, of course, think the landing zone is a general AI because there's a lot more to it than just the generative aspect. So Paul, dynamic number one that's different is, the world's talking about it, and it's got a big awareness aspect built in. Second is we have very relevant product sitting on top of very large datasets that we've helped to build for our customers over the last year. And we believe this is the inflection point. The singular, powerful concept that unlocks information management to its next level in the enterprise. There was inflection points for ERP, in CRM of integrated e-business suites. This is an inflection point for information management, to unlock the value of those datasets. So you got natural demand being driven by market, and breakthroughs in technology, the [indiscernible] and number two, we have very relevant and very timely technology on top of our platform. And as I said at OpenText World, It is okay to speak this way. We were late in SaaS. We are not late in AI. And we're going to capture the opportunity here for the company.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks for taking the questions.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Krishnaratne with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Hey there. Good evening. Just a couple of clarifications. You said Micro Focus contributed $563 million in the quarter. Is that correct. And if so, was that sort of within your expectations, or is it going better? And do we have a margin for Micro Focus in the quarter?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, Kevin, it's Madhu here. Thank you. So yes, $563 million in revenue. And as we mentioned, the integration is going very well. We are ahead of our internal plan. And from a margin perspective, I would point you to the fact that, being ahead of the plan, we are able to the projected Micro Focus will be on our 36% to 38% this fiscal year, which is really the first full fiscal year since the transaction.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Okay. And then a second clarification here, just on the SMB dynamic, I think you'd mentioned a $10 million to $15 million year-over-year revenue headwind. Is that correct? I'm just curious if you can dig into that a bit more and then remind us, if you can on how big SMB is in your base?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, I mean I'll comment and I'm sure Mark will chime in as well. So $10 million to $15 million revenue headwind is what we see in Q2. We pay attention to couple cycles. Obviously, the PC cycles and of course, all things associated with Microsoft as it intersects with our SMB business. Now having said that, I think Paul also mentioned in his note that we do have some products and innovation and new items to bring to market, and we've factored those into account for the second half of the fiscal year. And overall, we remain on target for our fiscal '24 revenues, including the cloud revenue. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, sure. Thank you, Madhu. This is not an OpenText challenge. This is a market challenge. And we all read the same headlines about the challenges in SMB. And SMB is less than 10% of our business. It's an important. It's a new area for us. We've only been in this area two to three years. We're never going to realize our full potential information management if we can't get to that mid-market. And we're much more interested in the mid-market than the S, the small part of the market. So as Micro Focus actually, Microsoft has recently said it's the most important sector for them. And as they do well, we will do well. As PC shipments rebound, we will do better. We're also bringing new product into this area, like our service management, mid-market, business network capabilities. So, it's really not our challenge. It's the market's challenge right now. And we're so well positioned that if the market picks up, we're going to be a beneficiary of it. But we wanted to call it out just to be clear on our cloud momentum, and help you model the business.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Good stuff. Yes, I appreciate the color. I'll pass the line. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Price with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Price: Hi, good evening. I just wanted to circle back on the focus on achieving organic growth at Micro Focus in fiscal '24. Just curious if you can share what organic growth at Micro Focus was this quarter. And how you expect to trend over the fiscal year. As you work towards organic growth at Micro, obviously maintenance is going to be the key driver, but I'll be curious if there's anything else we should be thinking about there as we think about organic growth in business by the end of fiscal '24?\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, Stephanie, it's Madhu here. So I'll take the first part, how to think about Micro Focus organic growth in the quarter. It's going to be a hard year-over-year compare. As we said, in the last couple of calls, our starting point is $2.3 billion of revenue. You take IFRS to GAAP, you take the digital safe, divestiture and we did decide to shed some contracts and not carry them forward. And $2.3 billion is in our baseline. And at $563 million, we've done well. It is our first quarter of this fiscal year and we do expect to grow organically in the entire year. And everything you heard so far on the Microsoft integration, the customers, the partners, all of that is going to play at all for us to exceed the $2.3 billion number.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes and Stephanie let me jump in as well. We're doing exactly what we said we would do. And we're going to show you Micro Focus every quarter for the fiscal year. But we don't have to through disclosure what we're going to. If you take $2.3 billion, divide it by 4, that is 575, our first quarter, seasonally small, a light quarter for us in Q1. We delivered 563, and you'll see that momentum build. And it's really that simple. We are very confident where we're turning Micro Focus to organic growth. We're off to a great start. And as Paul talked about the renewals, our strong product cycle, with private cloud, new SaaS offerings, Fortify on Demand, NetIQ, UCMDB SaaS, a first set of AI on top of Micro Focus, which they would never been able to get to if not part of OpenText. So, we're doing exactly what we said we'd do. We're going to show you, every quarter along the way. And we're off to a great start at 563.\nStephanie Price: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for the color.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. This is Jeremy on for Raimo. Just wanted to follow-up on the SMB headwind that you called out. So is it having like, maybe an outsized impact on any of the business lines like with security having six in Carbonite, which is more SMB focus. Is this sort of showing up more there or really anything you call out there would be helpful. Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, there's everything. I would call it a headwind, maybe a light breeze. And, we provided the additional color to help you model. That's really simple, right? So, there's no product to point to across the portfolio. Again, it's not us. It's the segment, right? PC shipments are clearly down. So there's less to sell into. Microsoft had delayed certain programs. They've now recently declared this is the most important segment. So it's going to build momentum. So, no, nothing specific to point to. I would not call it a headwind maybe a light breeze. And it's the segment. It's not us. It's not something specific. And we're excited about being a beneficiary as PC shipments go up. As Microsoft, builds their amazing machine here.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adhir Kadve with Eight Capital. Please go ahead.\nAdhir Kadve: Hey, good evening guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe outside of the AI showing up in bookings and driving that 20% growth. Is there any other particular areas across the six markets that you've defined, Mark, that are really driving that confidence in the 20%?\nMark Barrenechea: SaaS. So SaaS and AI. Titanium, was focused on many things, but top of the stack was SaaS applications, having a core content, core signature, core capture, core archive, starting to get into the machine, a SaaS-based service management, which we call SMAX. SaaS-based security through NetIQ, SaaS-based asset management with the universal configuration management database or UCMDB. Also, getting additional products in there as well. Mid market SaaS in business network. So, here, I'd say it's two things. It's a titanium delivered product, starts to get in the market, build demand, win business, and it's the second value on loss of AI, starting to get its first win.\nAdhir Kadve: Thanks, Mark. And then just on AI, you guys introduced a fairly robust product roadmap as well as products that are in market right now. Mark, any of those that are really kind of driving excitement or really driving undue, excitement from your clients that you could speak to.\nMark Barrenechea: I have to pick a child, which one I like. No. The -- we're going to follow. I think it's going to follow where the dataset far and the value that we can unlock. I'll start right in kind of our heritage in content management. And building these aviator personas next to the human persona for the claims manager, the claims adjuster, the contract offer -- so content certainly, is up there. I'd also say in ITOM. We have a very large installed base around service management and the ability to create that AI, aviator persona around the technical support assistant. So content ITOM I would probably shout out. We're going to leave the way early. Now with that said, the general applicability of search, very interesting for us. And a lot of workloads out there for machine generated and devices generated content via IoT. But I would, I'd look for content in ITOM, here in the early days.\nAdhir Kadve: Excellent. Thank you guys. I'll pass the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking the questions. This is George on for Steve. I want to talk about the AI products at the Aviator, set of products. You guys were fairly quick out to market with them, which I think is a testament to that 90 day release cycle. But maybe you could just talk about the decision to monetize these when maybe some of your customers are in an experimental phase. And I guess, how are you thinking about the kind of timeline to revenue contributions? Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Yes, George. Thank you for the question. As I said, last quarter, until we have revenue signals. We're not going to kind of change our outlooks, if you will until today. And I look at Q2, and we're seeing, we've gone through this whole cycle of the baby speaks through genitive AI in the consumer world, the rise of algorithms, the ability to do that in the consumer world. We've worked with our partners, Google and others, to ensure they're going to be private environments. We have our own technology that we've advanced to do sort of aspects of the AI preparatory work for customers. Embedding factorization. We've worked through a lot of the technology hurdles that pluggable language models because they're going to get very specific. And we've now with 23.4 have wave 1, a very practical capabilities. 24.1 brings the rest of the business clouds, the very practical capabilities And, we're demonstrating how within contact management, business network, in the ITOM space, in the developer space, where you can apply these aviator personas to sit next to the human to add significant value. So this is the next step. And, we're seeing the first demand signals and thus calling it out that we expect to see 20% bookings growth year-over-year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Yes. That's a really encouraging number. Maybe just to double click on that 20% kind of loud and clear that AI and SaaS are the top two drivers. Is there any contribution from Micro Focus adoption of a private cloud in there, or is that maybe a little farther down the pipeline?\nMark Barrenechea: There'll be some in there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter.\nMark Barrenechea: Thanks, George.\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Chan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Chan: Hey, Mark. Earlier you're mentioning that your customers are trained on your fiscal year end. Micro Focus is fiscal year end is in October. I know you've been trying to move some of those customers onto your timeline, but should we still expect a large number of their customers to still beyond the Micro Focus fiscal year end?\nMark Barrenechea: Look, Dan. I think it's going to take a year or two to kind get the full quarterization from the Micro Focus installed base. And that's Madhu's comments on paying attention to the quarterization. And, we've spent a lot of time doing -- teams spent a lot of time on the quarterly factors for Q2. And just a clear shout out to a balanced models in the second half of the year. So, look, we're making progress. We're going to always default to the customer and what the customer wants to do. But we're going to get to the OpenText cycle. We won't take a year or two, or we'll get there.\nDaniel Chan: Sounds good. Thanks for that. And then appreciate the color on the SMB impact from the macro. Just wondering if there's any update on the enterprise side of things. Last quarter, you said things were still looking good. Just wondering if there any updates on the enterprise customers? Thank you.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Yes, from the enterprise customers, Dan, thank you again for the question. And I assume you're referring to the cloud side, things are looking strong. And certainly, that's why we called out SMB going back to all that Mark said, in addition to the AI, the core solutions that we continue to build upon and innovate that continues to be strong demand for those, all business clouds included, right, it's on the enterprise side, cloud, non-SMBs, continues to be strong.\nDaniel Chan: Great. Thank you.\nMadhu Ranganathan: Thank you.\nMark Barrenechea: Yep. Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: I will now hand the call back over to Mr. Barrenechea for closing remarks.\nMark Barrenechea: Very good, Madhu, Paul. Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining today. Look, we're very excited to engage with you and tell you more of our story and on our new model for growth. And we're going to be participating at many upcoming conferences as Harry noted.
