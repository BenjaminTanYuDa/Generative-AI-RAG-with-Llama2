[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Edrick, CFO. Please go ahead.\nAlan Edrick: Well, thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Alan Edrick, Executive Vice President and CFO of OSI Systems, and I'm here today with Deepak Chopra, OSI's President and CEO. Welcome to the OSI Systems’ fiscal ‘24 second quarter conference call. We are pleased that you can join us as we review our financial and our operational results. Earlier today, we issued a press release, announcing our 2024 fiscal year second quarter financial results. Before we discuss our results, however, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will include forward looking statements and the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made on this call are based on currently available information, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement based on subsequent events or new information or otherwise. During today's call, we will refer both to GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures when describing the company's results. For further information regarding non-GAAP measures and comparable GAAP measures of the company's results and a quantitative reconciliation of those figures, please refer to today's earnings release. I will begin with a high-level summary of our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal '24 and then turn the call over to Deepak for a discussion of our business and operational performance. We will then finish with more detail regarding our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for fiscal year of 2024. We mentioned on the last earnings call that we expected to see accelerated growth beginning in Q2, and that was indeed the case. Our second quarter financial results were very strong with the Security Division again generating double-digit revenue growth and significant year-over-year operating margin expansion. The Opto division performed solidly, while the Healthcare division experienced a challenging quarter. We anticipate significant overall revenue and earnings growth for the balance of fiscal ‘24, and we are encouraged by the momentum in the business. Let's start with a summary of our fiscal 2024 Q2 results. First, revenues increased 26% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $373 million, driven by the performance in our Security division where revenues were up 49% year-over-year. Second, the strong revenue growth coupled with gross margin expansion led to record Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $2.21, up 86% from Q2 of the prior fiscal year. Third, bookings were solid with a book-to-bill of approximately 1, and we ended the quarter with a backlog of nearly $1.8 billion. This strong backlog provides outstanding visibility for the full fiscal year. Before diving more deeply into our financial results and discussing the fiscal ‘24 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Deepak.\nDeepak Chopra : Thank you, Alan, and thank you to everyone joining us today. I'm happy to report a record breaking second quarter for fiscal 2024 with revenues reaching $373 million, representing 26% growth year-over-year, and operating income growing 105% over the same period from last year. This exceptional performance was driven by relentless execution in security, complemented by solid results in the Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division. Our backlog, as Alan mentioned, and opportunity pipeline remains extremely healthy, providing confidence for strong performance in the second half of ‘24 and beyond. Let's discuss each division's performance starting with Security. The Security division delivered Q2 revenues of $250 million, representing 49% growth year-over-year from last year. Then double this profitability in the same period. The adjusted operating margin expanded significantly to 22.7%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher gross margin sales, efficient operations and robust market demand. Bookings were also solid, despite the sizable conversion of backlog to revenue in the quarter. The security division's backlog at the end of Q2 was comparable to the start of the fiscal year, given a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.0 in the first half of fiscal 2024. Q2 marked the commencement of revenue recognition on our recent major cargo programs announced earlier with SEDENA, the Mexican Defense Agency, as well as continued momentum on the cargo program with a large international customer previously announced. We continued to expand our presence for potent border solutions and secured significant recent new contracts Shortly after the quarter end, we announced a $59 million contract that we received in Q2 from an EMEA region customer for various cargo and vehicle inspection platforms, including our Eagle Series and car view systems. Furthermore, we are expected to integrate these inspection systems into a national command center through our proprietary CertScan integration platform, which has been gaining traction with port and border custom agencies worldwide, and allows us to differentiate our offering from our competitors. During the quarter, we also announced a $5 million award from a Latin American customer for port security solutions, including installation and integration support for the Eagle P60 High Energy Drive-through Cargo and Vehicle Inspection Z Portals High Throughput, and the VM500 Drive-through Radiation Monitoring Portal. Both of these awards include maintenance and service elements and highlight the compelling value and versatility of the multiple platforms available in our broad portfolio, creating ample opportunities for recurring revenue going forward. Our aviation business also had a good quarter as well as airport related activity continue to return to pre-pandemic levels. As a testament to our expansion at airports, we converted on a couple of significant airport opportunities. During Q2, we announced an $18 million contract to enhance an international airport security infrastructure with advanced screening solutions, including the RTT110 Real Time Tomography, explosion detection systems for screening whole baggage, metal walkthrough metal detectors, and Itemiser 5X Explosive Trace Detection System for secondary screening of passengers. We will be providing comprehensive multi-year maintenance service and support as part of these awards. We also announced another international airport win of a $15 million order for various checkpoint screening systems, enhancing air passenger safety and threat detection capabilities. Among the systems provided for this award include the ORION 920CT Checkpoint Screening System, ORION 920DX Dual View Checkpoint Screening Systems, and Itemiser 5X Explosive Trace Detection Systems. Besides the equipment as well as recurring maintenance and service revenue in forward years. Our turnkey projects continue to do well in Albania, Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The aviation project for turnkey service that we announced last year at a European airport went live in December. For this airport, we manage screening services for the staff, airline crews and vehicles at perimeter entry points. In addition, the planning phase has started for the recently awarded Uruguay or turnkey contract, and we look forward to becoming operational later this calendar year. With the numerous port and border opportunities in our pipeline, there are often meaningful discussions regarding a turnkey offering, even if the initial RFP or tender is for just traditional equipment and service only. We are excited to be the only company in the security screening marketplace that can point to a decade-long history of proven experience in managing successful turnkey programs of various sizes and scopes worldwide. Looking ahead, we believe that Security division has unprecedented visibility with a strong backlog and pipeline of opportunities for robust growth in balanced 2024 and beyond years. Let's looking at the Optoelectronics Division, which had another solid quarter. The Opto division has been working with certain OEM customers to accommodate their demand forecast that have involved some short-term, near-term push outs of deliveries. We see this as a transitional phase as OEMs in competitive markets increased levels to mitigate delays as a result of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic economy. Concurrently, we are also working with multiple OEMs to take over new programs as they trim their supplier base and gravitate towards more reliable and versatile suppliers like us. To that end, we had several notable bookings during the quarter and announced orders valued in aggregate of about $14 million. That included a $5 million order to provide electronic assemblies to a leading technology OEM customer, another $5 million for electronic assemblies to a motion control and fluid technology OEM. And finally, a $4 million order to supply military-grade components for missile systems to a leading defense electronics OEM. These awards highlight our capability to cater to our customer's base diverse and specialized needs. Building on a trend started last year, we are engaging with several customers that have a China centric supply chains and are looking to shift the focus to other regions like Southeast Asia, the U.S. or even near shore U.S., to help mitigate disruptions due to shutdowns in freight transportation. Consequently, we now have a wholly-owned facility open just now operational in Mexico that has about 60,000 square feet dedicated to manufacturing electronic components and higher-level assemblies. We are excited about this endeavor as many customers have indicated a clear desire to source from near shore, especially for finished products that are eventually destined for their customers in the U.S. Looking ahead, we believe that the Opto division is well positioned for long-term success. And finally, let's discuss the Healthcare division where revenues were down approximately 4% compared to the same period in the prior year. Definitely a disappointment. We had anticipated modest growth, but certain larger U.S. patient monitoring orders did not materialize in time. However, overall bookings were solid as the book-to-bill ratio was nearly 1.2, which is encouraging. The hospital market continues to be challenged, but we had several nice order wins during the quarter and continue to strength our hospital presence. We announced three orders totaling approximately $12 million, which included a $5 million order for patient monitoring solutions and related accessories for a U.S.-based hospital where we will also provide our advanced Rothman Index Safe and Sound Exhibit Central Station and Queue Bedside Patient monitors. This order arrived unfortunately close to the end of the quarter and could not be delivered within the quarter, but revenue is expected to commence in Q3. As I mentioned on the last call, Spacelabs is working on new innovative offerings to the marketplace, such as leasing and subscription programs to help reduce the burden of capital spending by the hospitals. To that end, I am happy to announce that Spacelabs has commenced offering remote telemetry management services to hospitals utilizing the SafeNSound digital health platform and mobile app to provide real-time patient monitoring services. We are committed to enhancing patient care and expanding our footprint in the healthcare sector by offering differentiated innovative features like SafeNSound patient alarm management and Rothman Predictive Health Analytics. We continue to significantly invest in developing new products to further strengthen our patient monitoring portfolio, including our next generation platform. Going forward, we will continue to focus on operational execution and aggressively pursue sales growth in this division that has the highest contribution margin in our company. Overall, we are very pleased with the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter performance. We are in a good position for the second half of ‘24 and have attained good visibility into fiscal 2025 and thereafter. Alan now will talk more in detail about our updated fiscal 2024 financial guidance and then we'll open up to questions.\nAlan Edrick : Well, thank you, Deepak. So let's review in greater detail the financial results for our fiscal ‘24 second quarter. Again, our fiscal Q2 revenues were up 26% with the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Q2 Security division revenues were up 49%, largely the results of sales growth of our cargo and vehicle inspection products. We also had double-digit revenue growth in our aviation and checkpoint products and related services. Q2 revenues included continued shipments from the $200 million plus cargo contract announced in January ‘23, and initial revenues from the $500 million plus cargo contract announced in March ‘23. Opto sales were down approximately 1% year-over-year. Strong intercompany Opto sales to support anticipated Security division growth were partially offset by reduced third-party revenues as certain Opto customers decreased inventory levels or are experiencing program delays, which we anticipate will continue to impact us for another quarter or so. The Healthcare division sales decreased 4% year-over-year with growth in recurring revenues of SaaS, service, supplies and accessories, along with growth in cardiology product revenues. These increases though were outweighed by a decrease in revenues reported for our largest product family, patient monitoring, in the challenging hospital CapEx environment. The fiscal ‘24 Q2 gross margin of 37.9% was up over 500 basis points from the 32.5% gross margin in Q2 last year. While the gross margin expanded in each division, the most notable improvement was seen in the security division, which experienced a favorable mix of sales along with strong operational execution. Our gross margin will generally fluctuate from period to period based on revenue mix and volume, inflation and impacts of changes in supply chain costs amongst other factors. Moving to operating expenses. We continue to work diligently across each of our divisions to improve efficiency and to prudently manage our SG&A cost structure. Q2 SG&A expenses were $71.6 million or 19.2% of sales compared to 18.3% of sales in Q2 of the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher compensation costs, including incentive compensation linked to our significant sales growth, increased professional fees, and a higher level of bad debt expense than in the prior year Q2. We expect to leverage our SG&A for fiscal ‘24 where such expenses are expected to decline as a percentage of sales on a full-year basis, implying a lower SG&A run rate in the second half of the 2024 fiscal year then we reported in Q2. Research and development expenses in Q2 of fiscal ‘24 were $16.4 million or 4.4% of sales, compared to $14.5 million or 4.9% of sales from the prior year quarter. We continue to dedicate considerable resources to R&D, particularly in security and healthcare, as we remain focused on innovative product development, which we view as vital to the long-term success of our businesses. We recorded $1 million of restructuring and other charges in Q2 of fiscal 2024, compared to $2.3 million of such charges in Q2 of the prior fiscal year. Moving to interest and taxes. Net interest and other expenses in Q2 increased to $6.5 million in fiscal year ‘24 from $5.2 million in fiscal year ‘23, primarily due to increased interest rates on a higher level of borrowings. We executed an interest rate swap during Q1 of fiscal ‘23 to fix a portion of our floating rate bank debt. Our reported effective tax rate under GAAP was 20.2% in Q2 of fiscal ‘24 compared to 19.5% in Q2 of fiscal ‘23. In Q2 of fiscal ‘24, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of $2.5 million compared to $0.7 million in Q2 of the last fiscal year. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, our normalized effective tax rate in Q2 of fiscal ‘24 was 25.7% compared to a normalized effective tax rate of 23% in Q2 last year. I will now turn to a discussion of our non-GAAP adjusted operating margin. Overall, our non-GAAP adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of fiscal ‘24 increased to 15.5% from 10.7% in Q2 of fiscal ’23, driven by strength in the Security division. The non-GAAP adjusted operating margin in the Security division expanded to 22.1% in Q2 of this year from 14.7% in Q2 of last year, primarily due to a favorable sales mix and operational improvements. The adjusted operating margin in our Opto division was again solid, increasing to 13.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from 13.1% in last year's Q2. The Healthcare's division's adjusted operating margin was negligible with the reduction in the division sales. Moving to cashflow. As mentioned on past calls, we expected to invest significant amounts in working capital associated with the anticipated strong growth in security. In Q2, cash used in operations was $23.5 million, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable associated with the revenue growth and inventory increases in preparation for program deliveries under the two large security division contracts announced last year. CapEx in the second quarter was $3.5 million, while depreciation and amortization expense was $10.3 million. Our balance sheet is solid with, modest net leverage of under 1.4x, and significant capacity for investments, acquisitions, and stock buybacks. Aside from $7.5 million of annual required principle payments under our bank term loan, the bulk of our debt matures in fiscal 2027. Finally, turning to guidance. We are increasing both our fiscal ‘24 revenues and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance. We currently expect our fiscal 2024 revenues to increase more than 19% over revenues in fiscal ‘23, and we anticipate our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS to grow more than 29% over our non-GAAP diluted EPS in fiscal ‘23. This non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance excludes potential impairment restructuring and other charges, amortization of inquired intangible assets and their associated tax effects, as well as discrete tax and other non-recurring items. We currently believe this guidance reflects reasonable estimates. The actual impact on the company's financial results of timing changes on expected revenues, disruptions and increased costs in the supply chain and inflation and interest rates is difficult to predict, and could vary significantly from the anticipated impact currently reflected in our estimates and guidance. Actual revenues and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share could also vary from the guidance indicated above due to other risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings. We continue to remain focused on the growth of our businesses and proactive management of our cost structure. We believe our efforts will enable OSI to continue providing innovative products and solutions. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the global OSI Systems team for its continued dedication in supporting our customers and partners. And at this time, we'd like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Nichols from B. Riley.\nJosh Nichols: Great to see such strong results, particularly from the Security division. I think you highlighted on the call, but you've had pretty strong award wins this year as well too, year to date, including that $59 million award out of the EMEA region. One, fair to assume that's not a backlog because it happened after quarter end. And then two, are you seeing other opportunities in this region or others with things like the conflict in Israel that are going on that could offer some large contract wins later this calendar year?\nDeepak Chopra : As I mentioned in my call, the pipeline in security looks very strong to us and in basically all regions. The only place that there is a little bit of slow down and everybody on hold is in U.S. because of what's going on in Washington. But all over the world, the pipeline is very strong and we believe that we are very well poised to win some other strong big contracts all over the globe. Not only just in cargo, but even in aviation.\nJosh Nichols: And then just since you touched on the U.S. I know, we don't have a budget yet. But if you're looking here, there's clearly a lot of focus on the southern border. You've had some very nice large award winds there. Could you talk about some of the opportunity that could come to fruition later this year on that front? Because there's still some good amount of availability under the IDIQs, or even later potentially, if we look at like a TSA refresh next calendar year or something like that.\nDeepak Chopra : Again, good question on the southern border, definitely there's a lot of interest and even in the temporary budgets that are being talked about it, there's lots of interest from both sides of the house for enhancing the border security. And we've said that before, we are very well poised for it. And the CVP itself has an IDIQ out there, which still has a lot of capacity and we are very much favored as a strong partner in that space. On your second half of the question, aviation, definitely the airport -- air traffic is increasing all over the globe, and we believe that we are very well poised for it, both domestically and internationally. And we've announced some orders internationally that there is a lot of growth opportunity and definitely there is some uncertainty with the Middle East, what's going on in the Ukraine. But we also look at it, and we've said it in a couple of times before, sooner or later, as this thing settle down and I keep praying that it does, all the areas around that area where there's conflict, all those countries will need security equipment. And we again, are very well poised for it.\nJosh Nichols: Thanks. The last question for me. One, impressive that the company's maintained this $1.8 billion backlog, despite what's been a pretty high conversion for the security with record 2Q revenue. I presume the visibility into not just this year, but fiscal ‘25 has to be improving as well with these new awards. Like, how much of the backlog do you think you're going to have for next year, and how much visibility do you have and confidence that you're going to be able to grow the top line, not just this year, but next year as well too?\nDeepak Chopra : Well, again, very good question. As we have said that, our backlog, even after the -- what you just mentioned, after a strong Q2 in revenue, still is very strong. Pipeline seems strong, and we think that it'll continue into the next years, not just ’25, into ‘26 and beyond. But as you know that, we already said that historically, it's a lumpy business. Some customers push it out, some people want it even accelerated into it, so that can happen. We don't want to give any specific numbers, but all we are saying is that we are sitting very pretty with a very strong backlog and a very strong pipeline, and the economy is looking good. The interest rates hopefully will come down, traffic is increasing, freight has to be moved around, and we think that all of that looks like good for the next coming years. Alan, you want to add something?\nAlan Edrick : No, I think that sums it up quite nicely. Strong visibility for the remainder of this year and into coming years. So we think we're quite well positioned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn : Question on healthcare. It sounds like a little better second half, most likely little seasonal help, right? And perhaps, it'll still be a little below normalized and maybe, if you can just work with that construct a little bit, how do we think about natural market normalization or progression beyond this year, the pandemic growth is maybe more digested, perhaps that's still an overhang or is the market just become a bit more of a street fight?\nDeepak Chopra: Well, again, you sort of answered it to yourself. During the pandemic, we got a little, I would call it a great tailwinds, and that's definitely slowing down. And if you read it everywhere, healthcare section is a challenging section. The hospitals are having a tough time. But at the same time, we believe that we have approached some new technology and products that we are looking at it. And one of the things that we are very much excited about it is, besides selling monitors, which is one of our primary businesses, that because of the shortness of capital and stuff, we believe the subscription model looks like a good catchall for medium to small hospitals. And we are very proud to announce that we actually have, what I said, a startup of what we call is a remote telemetry. People are sitting in a control room away from the hospital. We get a contract with the hospital and we give services to them. And anytime there is a vital sign event, the technician sitting in a control room far away from the hospital, they call up, we talk to the technicians, we tell them, hey, go look at patient number 14. And that is caught on. And it's a subscription model, it's a paying model. And with our Rothman Index also into it, we are sort of differentiating ourselves from our customers. But overall, it is a challenging business, and we are spending a lot of money for the last couple of years and will continue, hopefully with the success of a brand new platform in the coming year.\nChristopher Glynn: And then on the security margins, you called out a mix a couple times and it occurs to me, I wanted to ask, I think, different phases of these large projects might have different mixes. So should we regard the mix dynamic as kind of optimized in the second quarter relative to what's probable in most quarters as you execute these projects?\nAlan Edrick: A good question. It was indeed a favorable mix in the second quarter. That being said, a number of the projects that we have in our backlog and in our pipeline of opportunities appear to be strong margins as well. So while it may not carry the same gross margin profile that we saw in Q2, we still expect it to be very, very solid as we move forward. But it was a very favorable mix in Q2. You're exactly right.\nChristopher Glynn: And last one, no surprise on the slightly negative year to date free cash flow, I know, it's timing and obviously you have the projects and overall revenue ramp. But should we assume continue pretty, pretty tight next year and more harvest time in fiscal ‘25?\nAlan Edrick: Although we don't really provide cash flow guidance, I think directionally what you're saying is correct. We'll continue to invest in some working capital associated with these big contracts in the near term. And then there's an opportunity to harvest an awful lot of free cash flow going forward as we have in years in the past. So, we're excited about this. This is what we like to put our balance sheet to work with.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities.\nLawrence Solow : A couple follow-ups. Most of my questions been answered actually. Just on the margins, I know you don't get specific guidance out, but obviously in the security piece, I think it was a good 250 points above your previous record high. Curious, anything in there that would or going forward that would make this an unusual number or why can't we kind of sort of sit in, at least in this low 20s range as I look at just from the near fact that of a big bump in revenue, it looks like the last couple times you've gotten kind to this revenue level. You've also had margins sort of in that high 19s or over 20. So just trying to par out, is there anything that should kind of make this margin not sustainable?\nAlan Edrick : Yes, Larry, this is Alan. Good questions. And we don't disagree with you. Again, as we don't provide guidance on an operating margin level. But what you're talking about in the past seeing 19 and low 20s at these type of revenue levels, there's every reason to believe that those things are sustainable. There'll always be changes associated with the different mix in the like, but yes, we do believe that there's every opportunity to sustain and even increase those type of margins over time.\nLawrence Solow : Okay. In terms of sort of the order queue or the funnel not so much orders, but I guess, potential orders. As you look out, obviously, it sounds like most areas are still doing really strong. But can you just kind of give us a feel qualitatively where in terms of -- are you still seeing a lot of vehicle inspection demand? Is it cargo inspection at ports? What are sort of the bigger drivers, if you will?\nDeepak Chopra : This is Deepak here. Good question. It's a very broad. What I said in my statement, both in borders and port security and even in aviation, all that area, is a lot of demand and lot of interest, not only just for expansion, but also to replace the old technology with the new technology. And every customer is more conscious about to make it more efficient. And one of the things that we are very proud about it is because of our success turnkey multi-year contracts that have been very successful with happy customers, they make a very good reference point as a selling tool for customers that are not even thinking about going to a turnkey solution and best buying equipment. But they look at that and that expands into it. So our presence, and we can be very, very confidently say, we consider ourselves number one in this space. But I look at this as a growing business with the economy there and with people more security conscious and border security everywhere, people are more conscious and we have the right equipment. It's now no one area. It's broad all over the world.\nLawrence Solow : Okay. And just switching gears real fast and just on Opto, you mentioned, I guess a couple of things there. Just a little more color on the sort of the flattish quarter, but it sounds like you feel like this is temporary, were there specific -- you mentioned some program delays. I guess, were there a couple specific larger sort of delays that impacted the quarter and what kind of gives you the encouragement going forward? And then secondly, if you could just elaborate a little bit more, I guess you said, you're opening up a new facility in Mexico. Is that the case?\nAlan Edrick: So on the Opto side, there were no large programs to any significant magnitude that were delayed. It was just a number of programs from customers who probably overbought inventory a little bit during the pandemic times for risk mitigation and are now are right size in their inventory levels to a more optimum level and maybe some of their own programs have experienced some delays. So just a little bit of that kind of stuff that led to the relatively flat Opto sales. And as I said in sort of my remarks as well, that that could continue for another quarter or so, offsetting that to some extent going forward. We did open up a new facility in Mexico that we're excited about. It's gaining traction and we think it's going to be a big contributor to us in fiscal ’25 and beyond.\nDeepak Chopra: Just to add on to it. I did say that, and we've been saying that and we're seeing that. In this Opto space, this China-centric manufacturing customers are very concerned about it. They want to go broaden their portfolio with vendors who can deliver away from there. We are very well placed into it in Indonesia and Malaysia and India, and now with this Mexico facility open up, it gives us a broader reach to go to our OEM customers and cater to a bigger, bigger part for them to look at us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Martin from Roth MKM.\nJeffrey Martin : Wanted to touch on the markets in general. Where you think you are in terms of those being growth markets or whether you're gaining share, how that kind of parses out? And then specifically on security, what percentage of contracts now have CertScan? Are they all CertScan? That seems like a huge differentiator that could become kind of a self-fulfilling win rate as countries need to communicate across their systems and identify threats that can be helpful for prevention?\nDeepak Chopra: A very broad question. Definitely, I can't say CertScan is in everything, but we believe longer term, the two things that differentiate us from, in the security field from other competitors, we have a very broad product portfolio, high energy, medium energy, low energy, and we have demonstrated that we can integrate it together with the CertScan software and we can do it remote monitoring and stuff like that. All that stuff does help. But I won't go back to say that every unit or every contract we have has CertScan built into it. We do try to push that and we have seen success and I've said that where initially it might not have it, but then it results into the next add-ons and stuff like that. Regarding where position? I'm still very confident about it that I can say proudly that at least in the borders and sports security cargo, we are very, very confident that we are number one products portfolio, very good reputation, and we are very well liked by both domestic U.S. and international customers. Aviation, I don't think so that I can probably say we are number one, but we are number two and three, and we are catching ground, but we are also in that space, very good. In the air cargo space, we have a very broad portfolio and a very large install base, and we think that's another growth opportunity for us. And even in that space, we have started doing what is called remote monitoring for employee screening and stuff like that, where we are doing it from a remote control screen.\nJeffrey Martin: Great. And if I could just ask one more on a longer term, we look through more of a longer-term lens here. Could you help us understand where some of the bigger replacement cycles are throughout the world? I think in the U.S. you're going to see a passenger screening replacement cycle some point in the next several years here. But what other markets there might be replacement cycles upcoming, not necessarily in the next 12 months, but maybe in the next three to five years?\nDeepak Chopra : Well definitely replacement cycle for the check baggage is coming in U.S. in the next couple of years, if there's been some delay. Passenger screening, more AI, more automation is definitely going to happen. And internationally, there's not one specific area. Just look at it. Wherever there is passenger traffic, wherever you think that passenger traffic is going to increase, tourism or business related, all of them need the space for increasing their security. For example, one of the things everybody's talking about it, India has a huge potential growth opportunity. They're expanding in infrastructure. They're making like 20, 30, 40 new airports. We are very well positioned there. So those are the kind of places where we think, but there's no one specific area. It's all over, Mexico, Latin America, Middle East, Asia, even Africa, everywhere there is growth potential.\nJeffrey Martin : Great. And then just one more if I could. Latches onto what you just mentioned. Are there technologies where you feel like you've got some internal development to do. You do spend a lot on R&D, you mentioned AI in airport screening. Just curious if there's technologies out there that you see as a significant opportunity to continue to differentiate?\nDeepak Chopra : Well, the technology advancement will continue. In the cargo space, we are very well focused into it. We keep spending good money into it. We are integrating, like for example, CertScan and some other automation into the cargo space. In the aviation space, our checkpoint -- our RTT for check baggage is very well received. We are putting some AI into it. In the passenger screening and what I call the metal gates and the stuff, definitely there is technology out there for higher throughput, more technology to do better resolution stuff. We are working, developing it ourselves, plus also partnering with some new technology platforms to integrate our products.\nOperator: At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Deepak Chopra, CEO, for closing remarks.\nDeepak Chopra : Thank you all for participating in our call, and I want to again, thank our employees and our customers and all our stockholders supporting us. It's been a great quarter and we look forward to again talking to you and we feel very good and confident about our strong second half and the year beyond. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the OSI Systems First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Alan Edrick, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlan Edrick: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Alan Edrick, Executive Vice President and CFO of OSI Systems, and I'm here today with Deepak Chopra, OSI's President and CEO. Welcome to the OSI Systems Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. We are pleased that you can join us as we review our financial and operational results. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our 2024 fiscal year first quarter financial results. And before we discuss our results, however, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, and the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made on this call are based on currently available information, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement based on subsequent events or new information or otherwise.  During today's call, we will refer both to GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures when describing the company's results. For further information regarding non-GAAP measures and comparable GAAP measures of the company's results and a quantitative reconciliation of those figures, please refer to today's earnings release.  I will begin with a high-level summary of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 and then turn the call over to Deepak for a discussion of our business and operational performance. We will then finish with more detail regarding our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for fiscal year '24. Our first quarter financial results were generally solid with the Security Division again generating double-digit revenue growth and significant year-over-year operating margin expansion, and the Opto division performing very well, while the Healthcare division experienced a challenging quarter. We are enthusiastic about the overall significant revenue and earnings growth anticipated for the balance of fiscal '24.  Let's start with a high-level summary of our Q1 results. First, we reported Q1 revenues of $279 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 4%, driven by revenue growth of 14% in our Security Division and 2% in the Opto Division, which were partially offset by a 13% decrease in revenue in the Healthcare division. Second, we reported Q1 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.91, up 5% from Q1 of the prior fiscal year, as strong operating results overcame the impact of approximately $0.11 per share of additional interest expense associated with higher interest rates in our borrowings.  Third, we ended the quarter with a backlog of nearly $1.8 billion. The strong backlog provides outstanding visibility for the full fiscal year. Before diving more deeply into our financial results and discussing the fiscal 2024 outlook, I will turn the call over to Deepak.\nDeepak Chopra: Thank you very much, Alan. Good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to report that our fiscal 2024 first quarter performance aligned with our expectations. We achieved 4% revenue growth with increased margins. With a strong backlog, coupled with a significant recent awards and high visibility into the opportunity pipeline, we expect significant revenue and adjusting -- adjusted earnings per share growth through fiscal '24 and beyond.  So let's dive into the performance and highlights of each division during the quarter and begin with the Security Division, which saw an increase of 14% in Q1 revenues and operating margin expansion. The division had bookings of 174 million during the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. During the quarter, we made considerable progress on the ramp-ups for our recently awarded port and border security initiatives with Mexico's Defense Agency SEDENA and the other international customers.  We anticipate that both programs will contribute substantial revenues in this fiscal year. During Q1, we successfully captured several port and border security customer opportunities in the U.S. and internationally. On the international front, we announced an award for $14 million from a Latin America-based customer to provide multiple units of our Eagle P60 high-energy drive-through cargo and vehicle inspection system. Also, the VM250 radiation portal monitors and the MINI Z handheld backscatter devices, along with our proprietary CertScan integration installation software and training and maintenance service and support.  In addition, we also announced a $10 million contract from an international customs agency to provide dual energy X-ray cargo and vehicle inspection solution, including multiyear maintenance service and support. In the U.S., we announced a $14 million award from an existing U.S. customer to provide civil works and installation support for our cargo and vehicle inspection systems. And wrapping it up in the ports and borders shortly after the quarter end, we announced an award that we received in Q1 of a 10-year contract to provide a turnkey screening solution to Uruguay's Ministry of Economics and Finance.  The Eagle P60 high-energy, trailer-mounted vehicle inspection system will be used to perform security screening and remote image analysis utilizing the proprietary CertScan integration platform.  We will also provide on-site operator training, ongoing maintenance, service and support. I just want to talk a little bit more about our CertScan software, which is our proprietary software solution that helps manage inspection image data, traffic and vehicle identification at checkpoints. Along with CertScan's utilization as a critical piece in a turnkey solution, we utilize CertScan frequently on traditional hardware installations as customers increasingly integrate screening systems with existing data and communication centers. Furthermore, when new data managed infrastructure is required for specific program initiatives, we are often involved in supporting the planning and construction of these facilities. The Uruguay program will join our long-standing successful turnkey projects like Puerto Rico, Albania, et cetera, where we have demonstrated our experience and capabilities in handling large-scale programs for customs and border protection agencies.  We have an extensive presence with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP, in the United States where we are actively supporting recent border security efforts through equipment and service orders received to date for about $200 million. The CBP has room under 2 active indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity that have IDIQs that have a combined total potential award value of about $870 million. Although the U.S. government is currently operating under a continuing resolution, we are hopeful that additional orders could be issued once the U.S. government's '24 budget is passed and signed into law. Our checkpoint security products and related services team continues to support its customer base in airports, transportation, government facilities and other critical infrastructures. Our latest explosive trace detection system, ETD, the Itemiser 5X, is now approved by the European Union for use at European airports qualified by TSA, ACSTL for air cargo and certified by the China Aviation Authority, or CAAC, for use at airports.  The Itemiser 5X has some of the most advanced software algorithms and optimize detection liabilities, making it an ideal tool for identifying explosives, narcotics and other harmful compounds. We have been diligently collaborating with international airports regarding potential passenger and baggage screening enhancements to align with the latest technology regulatory standards. We remain optimistic about the continued expansion in the aviation CT checkpoint and checked baggage area, together with the Itemiser 5X projects and have a good healthy backlog. Overall, the Security division had a great start for fiscal '24. And with a strong backlog, we expect it will do significantly better in the remainder of fiscal '24.  Moving to the Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division. Opto delivered impressive results during the first quarter with another all-time quarterly revenue record, achieving $96 million in revenue, including intercompany and generating strong profitability. In addition to being a vital supplier to our Security and Healthcare divisions, Opto continues to serve its diverse OEM customer base that provides various solutions in aerospace, defense electronics, test and measurement, medical devices, automotive and consumer electronics.  With our strong global presence manufacturing covering the U.S., England, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, combined with a continued trend of customers seeking robust manufacturing alternate to China manufacturing, we look forward to capturing new opportunities with our existing customer base and with new customers.  Finally, on to the Healthcare division, where Q1 was a tough quarter as sales went down 13% year-over-year due to challenging marketing conditions, especially in the U.S., where hospital profitability has been hampered, which, in turn, has caused delays in capital expenditures. The silver lining was growth in the European region, backed by a recently launched cardiology products and services.  The capital constraints at hospitals are actually helping to drive market adoption of a new business model that we have talked before also that reduced the need for significant capital outlays.  This division continues to develop innovative new business models and solutions such as leasing and subscription programs. The Rothman Index-based predictive analytics software and SafeNSound patient alarm management software are good examples of tools that can help hospitals increase the efficiency of their existing patient monitoring infrastructure.  We continue to invest significantly in R&D and new products innovations. Although Healthcare didn't start well in first quarter, we expect its performance to improve during the rest of the year '24.  In summary, with significant backlog in security and Opto, we are confident about our prospects in these divisions. We also expect more robust performance from Healthcare as we look forward to the rest of fiscal '24.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Alan Edrick to talk in more detail about our financial performance before opening the call for questions. Thank you.\nAlan Edrick: Well, thank you, Deepak. Now I will review in greater detail the financial results for our fiscal '24 first quarter. Again, our Q1 revenues were up 4% compared with that of the first quarter in the prior fiscal year. Q1 Security Division revenues were up 14%, largely due to the growth in our cargo and vehicle inspection products and related service revenue. This included modest shipments from the $200 million plus cargo contract announced in January.  Aviation-related revenues increased as well. The book-to-bill ratio in the Security Division for Q1 was 1.1, leading to a record backlog in this division. Opto sales increased 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong intercompany sales to support anticipated Security Division growth, which was partially offset by reduced third-party revenues as certain Opto customers are rightsizing inventory levels or had programs delayed.  The Healthcare division, as Deepak mentioned, had a challenging first quarter with year-over-year revenues down 13%, driven primarily by reduced patient monitoring product sales. The fiscal '24 Q1 gross margin of 35.4% was up significantly over the 32.6% gross margin in Q1 last year, despite the reduction in sales in Healthcare, which is the division which is the highest gross margin among our 3 divisions. The gross margin expansion was led by the Security Division, which experienced a favorable mix of sales, along with the execution of certain operational improvements.  Our gross margin will generally fluctuate from period to period based on revenue mix and volume, inflation and impacts of changes in supply chain costs, among other factors.  Moving to operating expenses. We continue to work diligently across each of our divisions to improve efficiency and to prudently manage our SG&A cost structure. Q1 SG&A expenses were $59.8 million, representing a 12% increase over the prior year, driven by less favorable FX and a lower level of bad debt recoveries in Q1 of fiscal '24 compared to the prior year. We do expect to leverage our SG&A for the full year fiscal '24, where such expenses are expected to decline as a percentage of sales on an annual basis.  Research and development expenses in Q1 of fiscal '24 were $15.9 million, up from $14.5 million in the same prior year quarter. We continue to dedicate considerable resources to R&D, particularly in Security and Healthcare, as we remain focused on innovative product development, which we view as vital to the long-term success of our businesses. In Q1 of fiscal '24, we recorded $0.5 million of impairment restructuring and other charges compared to $1.2 million of such charges in the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year.  Moving to interest and taxes. Net interest and other expenses in Q1 increased from $3.4 million in fiscal '23 to $5.7 million in fiscal '24, primarily due to increased interest rates in our borrowings. We executed an interest rate swap during Q1 of fiscal '23 to fix a portion of our floating rate bank debt. On the tax side, the reported effective tax rate under GAAP was 23.4% in Q1 of fiscal '24 compared to 24.4% in Q1 of fiscal '23. In Q1 of this year, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of $0.4 million compared to $0.1 million in Q1 of the last fiscal year.  Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, our normalized effective tax rate in Q1 of fiscal '24 was 25.8% compared to a normalized effective tax rate of 25.1% in Q1 of fiscal '23. I will now turn to a discussion of our non-GAAP adjusted operating margin. Overall, our non-GAAP adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of fiscal '24 increased to 9.6% from 8.7% in Q1 of fiscal '23, driven by strength in the Security and Opto Divisions.  The non-GAAP adjusted operating margin in the Security Division expanded to 14.3% in Q1 of this year from 12.8% in Q1 of last year, primarily due to the mix of sales and operational improvements. The operating margin in our Opto Division was again solid, increasing to 12.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 from 12.7% in last year's Q1. And with the reduction in sales in the Healthcare division, this segment's adjusted operating margin was negligible.  Moving to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $17 million in Q1 of fiscal '24, which was comparable to the prior year first quarter, despite the significant build of inventory that we mentioned on the last earnings call would occur in preparation for program deliveries under the 2 large Security Division contracts announced in fiscal '23. CapEx in the 2024 fiscal first quarter was $5.2 million, while depreciation and amortization in Q1 was $9.6 million.  Our balance sheet is solid, with modest net leverage of under 1.4 and significant capacity for investments, acquisitions and stock buybacks. Aside from $7.5 million of annual required principal repayments under our bank term loan, the bulk of our debt matures in fiscal '27.  And finally, turning to guidance. We are reiterating our fiscal '24 revenues, and we are increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance. We continue to expect our fiscal '24 revenues to increase more than 18% over revenues in fiscal '23. We expect our fiscal '24 non-GAAP diluted EPS to grow more than 27% over our non-GAAP diluted EPS in fiscal '23. This fiscal '24 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance excludes potential impairment, restructuring and other charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and noncash interest expense and their associated tax effects as well as discrete tax and other nonrecurring items.  We currently believe this guidance reflects reasonable estimates. The actual impact on the company's financial results of timing changes on expected revenues, disruptions and increased cost in the supply chain and inflation and interest rates is difficult to predict and could vary significantly from the anticipated impact currently reflected in our estimates and guidance.  Actual revenues and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share could also vary from the guidance anticipated above due to other risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings. We continue to remain focused on the growth of our businesses and proactive management of our cost structure. We believe our efforts will enable OSI to continue providing innovative products and solutions.  We would like to take this opportunity to thank the global OSI Systems team for its continued dedication in supporting our customers and partners. And at this time, we would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Nichols from B. Riley.\nMichael Nichols: And it's really good to see the company with a new turnkey Security award here in Uruguay. A couple of questions there. These have been historically high-margin awards for the company. One, how long do you expect for this to ramp up and any context you could give us in terms of the potential size of the award?\nDeepak Chopra: This is Deepak here. This is not a very large contract, and it will take us about 6, 8 months to get it going. And basically, it's in the similar kind of sizes as the other contracts that we have. And we're very, very excited about it because one of the things that we are very proud about it when we get these kind of turnkey contracts in different areas, they become like center piece for the rest of the area to look at it. And all these turnkey contracts, basically, we are making it a point to say this helps the trade between Uruguay and, for example, North America or Europe.  So we continue to look at it at these kind of big successes of going forward. Alan, do you want to add something to it?\nAlan Edrick: No. I think that was good. And Josh, while we don't talk about margins on specific deals, generally speaking, the margins on our turnkey contracts are nicely north of our overall corporate average.\nMichael Nichols: Well, thanks for confirming that the company has really been building out its Security portfolio. You've been granted approval for ETD with the TSA now to, how should we think about the timing and opportunities specifically for ETD over the next, like, 12 to 18 months and how that could ramp up?\nDeepak Chopra: Again, we are very proud about the certification. We think it's a great product. And we do definitely know that in air cargo, there's a big revamp going on for new technology. And we are very well poised for it. In the international sector, we think that the growth will come even faster. So we are very excited about it. And as we go back and look at and the performance of these units compared to the present existing products there, we think that we'll continue to get a lot of success in this.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Martin from ROTH Capital Partners.\nJeffrey Martin: I wanted to get a sense in terms of the timing on these 2 large orders that are going to be ramping up here pretty significantly. How much has your visibility on timing improved over the last -- well, since the Q4 call? And I also wanted to ask in terms of supply chain if you were able to get components that you need? I know you're ordering significantly more than normal. Just an update there on both those time lines and experiences would be helpful.\nAlan Edrick: Jeff, this is Alan. I'll take the first part of that question. Our visibility continues to improve as we go month by month on these 2 large contracts. There are, as you would imagine, on large contracts, often evolving changes, but we're really excited about it. We do anticipate starting to see a real ramp-up in revenues on these contracts beginning now in this quarter in Q2, which is really going to generate some significant revenue growth, we believe, over the balance of fiscal '24.  So we expect that there will always be some changes to the timing and the schedule. That's the nature of the beast in this industry, but the visibility continues to improve and the ramp-up is happening as we speak.\nDeepak Chopra: Just to add on to it, this is Deepak here. Basically, in the supply chain issue, we are handling it well. And again, I've said in the last conference call, too, we are well positioned compared to other competitors because we have intercompany resources also. But definitely, we cannot ignore the fact that when you ramp up so significantly so fast that there are definitely challenges in the supply chain. We are addressing it. And as Alan has mentioned that we will start seeing big growth from both these contracts in Q2, almost into Q3 and Q4.\nJeffrey Martin: Great. And then my other question is with the unrest in the Middle East, does that create potential opportunities for you? Are you seeing increased inquiries from countries and surrounding area for stepping up their port and border equipment inspection capabilities or other areas?\nDeepak Chopra: Well, first, I would like to say that we are very saddened what what's happened there. We continue to pray it for everybody's well-being. I haven't seen any changes on this Middle East thing because, obviously, this is something new. But on the Ukraine project and stuff, definitely as things mature in that area, common sense is that countries around that area are all going to need more security equipment. And we continue to look at opportunities. We're working with it.  At the same time, funding is very important. And as you know that the U.S. has been in a tough situation with what's happening in Washington. As that opens up both for the Middle East challenges and in Ukraine-Russia challenges, we are very well positioned for any equipment to be procured.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities.\nLawrence Solow: Just, I guess, a follow-up to the last question just on how the contracts are ramping. And just specifically, Alan, just in terms of the increase in guidance, I know you don't guide, but to the sectors or the segments. But, I guess, it's sort of the increase, I feel like is that coming from Security? Is that just increased confidence there? Or what typically drives you to increase your EPS outlook this year?\nAlan Edrick: Yes. Great question, Larry. And your hunch is correct. The growth in the EPS guidance is coming from our Security business. You saw in our Q1 that we just reported, we saw some nice operating margin expansion, which led to some stronger earnings. And as we look out through the balance of the year and some of the strength in that business, that is really what's driven us to increase the overall EPS guidance. We expect Opto to continue to perform well in addition to that, but Security that's leading to the growth in the EPS guidance.\nLawrence Solow: Okay. And I don't know if you gave -- you quantified the book-to-bill for Security. But if you have that, that would be great. But just also just kind of qualitatively, obviously, the world is not getting to be a safer place, but opportunities in terms of your opportunities, your funnel of opportunities, I think you usually like to refer that, both within vehicle inspection borders and outside of that and other areas, how are those trending? And if you had the book-to-bill for the quarter, that would be great?\nAlan Edrick: Yes. So Larry, this is Alan. The book-to-bill in security was 1.1, positions us in a record backlog. So our highest backlog of all time for our Security Division. The visibility is strong. The funnel of opportunities is real strong and robust throughout the -- really throughout the world and the nature of our product lines. Maybe Deepak, do you want to add to that?\nDeepak Chopra: Yes. I just want to emphasize on to it. The opportunities are growing, both in the border area, air cargo and also in the aviation sector. That had been on pretty much hold during the COVID time. And as it's coming out, the traffic is increasing. And there is a lot of interest to upgrade to new products in technology, both in the Itemiser and the RTT checkpoint and checked baggage area. And we continue to look at it, and we are very optimistic about the funnel.\nLawrence Solow: Okay. And just lastly, just shifting gears real fast on the Healthcare, slower start to the year than I think you had expected. I guess two questions. And again, I'm not -- if you can share with us your thoughts. But maybe I know you had thought that the segment would be up on both a revenue and an operating profit basis on a full year basis. Do you still feel like that's attainable?  And then second part of that question is, you mentioned sort of a shift to more of a leasing versus upfront sale of the equipment. Is that like in its infancy? Is that still pretty small today? And does that kind of coincide at all with your perhaps I think you're planning on next-generation product coming out soon over the next couple of years. Is that those two kind of correlate with one and another? That would be great if you put any color on that.\nDeepak Chopra: Well, good question. Good analysis you've done. On the equipment side, definitely, we were disappointed, especially in U.S. with the equipment sale. As you, I'm sure, know, the hospitals are going through a tough time. There are two other things that what you asked. One is, we continue to do the R&D investment to develop a new platform of the patient monitoring. At the same time, this new model that is in the infancy that we have started, the subscription and the software model, the SaaS model, it's a little different model. But interestingly, thing is this is catching on. There's a lot of interest, though, it's something in the infancy new that we are doing.  But just think of it, we've been doing this thing in the Security side. So now to do that in the Healthcare side, we at least know the building blocks. Now the question is how to educate the customers and how to be able to prove to them. But I think longer term, we are quite excited about this new model of ongoing revenue, what we call like the turnkey model that we have on the Security side. Alan, do you want to add something?\nAlan Edrick: Sure. And to your questions, Larry, yes, those new models are in their infancy, and we think they're going to be growing nicely over the coming years. And our expectation -- the team's expectation is that the Healthcare division will grow for the full fiscal year in '24, both on the top line and the bottom line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: A lot has been asked. One follow-up. I think you said you expect on Healthcare, some nice improvement starting sequentially really for the balance of the year relative to the first quarter. It sounds like you were caught off guard a little bit in the first quarter after some fourth quarter strength. So wondering how you describe the visibility to the expected pickup there?\nDeepak Chopra: Well, yes, we are disappointed in the first quarter. But keep in mind that over the years, firstly, it's a single-digit growth area, and it's booked and shipped. It's not a backlog driven. So some orders came in Q4. In Q1, we were expecting some, it didn't happen. So it is a little bit disappointing, but the team feels very much focused onto it that the remainder of the year will get better. And the innovation that we are doing both in the software SaaS model and our continued development of the new product portfolio, that's not going to have what I would call a significant impact in 2024.  It's for a longer years. Focus right now is to be able to capture the accounts that we have and be able to work with the hospitals of alternates to them of making them more efficient. Alan?\nAlan Edrick: No, I think that describes it well.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And it was nice to see positive free cash flow in the first quarter. It's often a challenging seasonal quarter and in particular, this year, just ahead of significant ramps at Security. So wondering if you could give some color on what sort of levels, range, metrics around free cash flow we should be looking for this year?\nAlan Edrick: Chris, this is Alan. Good question. So while we don't provide free cash flow guidance, we would agree with your statement in light of growing our inventory by $80 million to support the large Security contracts still generating $17 million or so of operating cash flow was quite strong in Q1. As we look out, there'll be some continued buildup in inventory for these contracts. We think where the real, real significant free cash flow could be driven is in fiscal '25, fiscal '26 and beyond.  I mean we've historically been a very strong generator of free cash flow. We think that strength will only increase as we move beyond this fiscal year. We do expect to generate nice free cash flow this year, but the real strength in the free cash flow will begin in the subsequent fiscal year is our current expectation.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And then just one on Opto and manufacturing, really looking very sturdy, a lot of short-cycle volatility out there from OEMs and distribution impacting a lot of names. And just so curious if you could describe a little bit about what's giving that stability, particularly how externals performed? And if you're seeing a regular cadence of wallet share additions with your global customers as they try to derisk supply chain?\nDeepak Chopra: Well, again, a very good question. It's a different marketplace. Basically, in some cases, is a very predictable customer base. We work with the OEMs, and we continue to look at it. But they're also going through basically inventory increase, stop it, go longer term. So it's a continuing evolving matter. The thing that really makes us very, very good compared to our competitors, one is, we've a very broad customer base from aerospace, defense, to automotive, medical, consumer, name it, we're in all spaces.  So as a group, all those areas, some are weak, some are strong. And the second thing that we keep saying it, and I've said it before, and I said it again, our global presence of manufacturing is a big advantage. And lately, you've heard it everywhere that there's a lot of talk about alternate to China. And we have the ability, both in Asia and in U.S. and in Europe to manufacture products from our customers. So we look at this business as a very well thought out business, predictable business. But like I said, this is a focus of the business depending on our customer base. Alan?\nAlan Edrick: No, I think that says it well.\nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.\nDeepak Chopra: Well, thank you very much, and we again want to thank all the employees of the company and all the customers and everybody else, including the stockholders and not to forget the analysts. We are very excited about the rest of the year. Backlog is there to support it. And we are looking at a lot of other opportunities. And we think that the balance of the year starting in Q2 into Q3, Q4 will be very strong. Thank you very much. Talk to you in January.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."
