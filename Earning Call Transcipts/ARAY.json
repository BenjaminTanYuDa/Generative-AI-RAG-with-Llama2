[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jesse Chew, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nJesse Chew: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Accuray's conference call to review financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, which ended December 31, 2023. During our call this afternoon, management will review recent corporate developments. Joining us on today's call are Suzanne Winter, Accuray's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ali Pervaiz, Accuray's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our call today includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are outlined in the press release we issued just after the market close this afternoon as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We based the forward-looking statements on this call on the information available to us as of today's date. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. Accordingly, you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. A few housekeeping items for today's call. First, during the Q&A session, we request that participants limit themselves to two questions and then re-queue with any follow-ups. Second, all references to a specific quarter in the prepared remarks are to our fiscal year quarters. For example, statements regarding our second quarter refer to our fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, there will be a supplemental slide deck to accompany this call, which you can access by going directly to Accuray's Investor Relations page at investors.accuray.com. With that, let me turn the call over to Accuray's Chief Executive Officer, Suzanne Winter. Suzanne?\nSuzanne Winter: Thank you, Jesse. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining the call. Accuray delivered another strong quarter with outstanding order growth, driven by our new product introductions and both top and bottom line performance, consistent with our expectations for the first-half. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few key points from the 3-year outlook we introduced at our ASTRO Investor Day in October. These include driving revenue growth through innovation to advanced care, broadening our product portfolio to compete in the global value segment, accelerating growth in our recurring service solutions business and improving profitability while strengthening our balance sheet. I'm proud to say that in the first-half of FY '24, we have made good progress on each of these strategic pillars and advanced significant growth catalysts that will be realized in the coming quarters. We believe new product launches like VitalHold for the Radixact, Tomo C in China, Helix, our Helical value segment product and Cenos, online adaptive capability will be growth catalysts and begin to accelerate revenue and profitability growth in Q4 and into FY '25 and beyond. Reflecting on Q2, I am extremely pleased with order performance, which at $94 million represents 19% year-over-year growth and a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.8. We believe 1.2 book-to-bill ratio is a healthy target. So at 1.8, we are very pleased with these results, which were driven by customer adoption of our new product innovation and high-impact commercial strategies. We received Shonin market clearance for VitalHold in Japan with a full introduction at the Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology Conference where we received seven orders at the close of the conference. VitalHold enhances breast cancer treatment by enabling surface-guided therapy designed to protect the heart and lungs and as a result of our joint development with C-RAD. We believe this will further strengthen our number two market share position in Japan. Additionally, we are advancing progress on gaining market clearance for Cenos online adaptive capabilities on our precision treatment planning solution. This clearance is expected in the second half of the fiscal year for the U.S. market and we believe it will enhance our competitive win rate and allow us to build our order backlog for trade-in, trade-up replacements and upgrades for our installed base of Radixact Systems. Cenos leverages AI technology and is a result of our partnership with Limbus AI, and we are encouraged by continued customer interest since ASTRO. We believe it will help drive higher competitive win rates and installed base growth to the Radixact platform. Now turning to our Tomo C system in China. Q2 was our first quarter since regulatory approval to market the system in China and was an important indicator of customer response. We saw overall 44% year-over-year order growth in the China region within the quarter. And while this partially represents some pent-up demand for Tomo C, we expect order activity to continue to be strong towards fiscal year-end with revenue and margin growth beginning in Q4 and into FY '25 pending customer installation timing. As a reminder, Tomo C expands our portfolio in China with a domestic-made product and enhances our access into the Type B market, which represents approximately $600 million annually over the next five years. Additionally, our Q2 performance in service was outstanding with 8% revenue growth year-over-year. As we have discussed, the service business is a strategic area of focus for the company, and each service contract represents a recurring revenue stream over the 10 to 12-year life of the system after the warranty period. Although we remain in the early innings of our service transformation, I am very pleased to see impact from the strategic actions we put in place to improve commercial performance and enhance our offerings. Finally, Q2 global demand for installation was strong, and we ended the quarter with 6% growth year-over-year in our global installed base of systems. This was led by the APAC region, which celebrated the milestone of 250 systems installed and remains one of our fastest-growing installed base regions at 13% year-over-year growth. As we look at our business model going forward, we see installed base growth as a leading performance indicator and the primary driver behind future service contract revenue. As service revenue grows, we expect to benefit from scale and see a significant bottom line impact from improving margins. From a region perspective, the EIMEA region continues its outstanding performance in both orders and revenue with 30% and 11% growth year-over-year, respectively. The APAC region had 42% order growth year-over-year, with China delivering 44% growth, reflecting strong demand. Revenue in APAC was impacted in Q2, primarily due to customer tender timing in Australia and Taiwan, which resulted in APAC revenues being down 8% year-over-year. We expect this to resolve by our fiscal year-end, along with backlog conversion of new Tomo C orders in China to accelerate revenue recovery starting in late Q4. Japan delivered positive order growth and on a constant currency basis was up 8% year-over-year. However, the negative impact of FX versus last year reduced actual order growth to 2.4%. Service revenue in the region grew by 10% on a constant currency basis, but total revenue was down 29% due to lower product shipments, which we expect will offset with higher volume in the second-half. On the positive side, the region continues to lead with key competitive wins at 50% of new orders coming from competitive replacements. The Americas region showed a strong sequential order growth of 72% from the prior quarter. This is the direct result of focused commercial strategies to help customers with value-added solutions to retain and grow the installed base. In Q2, we saw longer customer installation time lines in the Americas region with revenues down 15% year-over-year, but we are encouraged by the strong 17% sequential quarterly revenue growth and are cautiously optimistic that conditions will improve over the coming quarters. Operationally, we are executing on our margin expansion plans. Ali will discuss our progress in greater detail as we're seeing strong progress in the financial initiatives we laid out at the beginning of the year and at our Investor Day. Specifically, we're seeing positive trends in pricing initiatives across our product and service solutions, a reduction in operating costs and lower service costs due to improved parts consumption. This has had a direct impact on service margin, which has improved by 160 basis points in the first-half of the year, compared to the same period last year and gives us a higher degree of confidence in our longer-term margin expansion plan. Margin expansion remains a cultural transformation. And over the last 18 months, we have implemented new organizational structures with P&L accountability, new operating mechanisms to ensure we gain incremental price for our differentiated solutions, ensuring a faster and more predictable revenue cycle and continuing to drive cost efficiencies while increasing customer satisfaction value. I will now turn it over to Ali, who will speak more about our financial performance.\nAli Pervaiz: Thank you, Suzanne, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to begin by thanking our global employees and cross-functional teams, who continue to amaze us with their incredible work ethic and ability to execute on our strategy. Turning to the financials. Product growth orders for the second quarter were approximately $94 million, which is a 19% increase versus the prior year and 18% once adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. This is the strongest order volume we've had in the last two fiscal years. And as Suzanne mentioned, it speaks to the market's confidence in our products and new innovations. We're proud of our commercial teams across the globe that were able to contribute to the strong result. This further strengthens our backlog and is a clear sign of the health and vitality of the future of our business. This order intake represents a book-to-bill of 1.8, mostly driven by customer timing and improved pricing, which grew order margin rate by 8 points sequentially across our product portfolio. Net revenue for the second quarter was $107 million, which was up 3% sequentially and down 7% versus the prior year. Net revenue on a constant currency basis for the second quarter was $106 million, which represents an 8% decrease versus the prior year. Net revenue for the first half of the fiscal year is flat to the prior year. Service revenue for the quarter was $56 million, up 8% from the prior year and up 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in contract revenue and higher installation, training and spare parts volume as expected. This lift in service revenue exceeds our year-over-year installed base growth of 6%, illustrating that our pricing actions and our service contracts are now starting to be reflected in our P&L. Service revenue for the first-half of the fiscal year is 3% up versus prior year, driven by contract revenue, which was up 6% for the half. Product revenue for the second quarter was $52 million, down 19% from the prior year, driven by 6 fewer unit shipments versus last year. As discussed in our last earnings call, our revenue profile in fiscal year '24 is more back-end loaded towards the second half, which is a result of the timing of our new product introductions. Product revenue for the first half of the fiscal year is down 3% versus the prior year. Moving to the backlog. We ended the second quarter with a product order backlog of approximately $492 million, which represents greater than 2 years of FY '23 product revenue. This reported backlog is up 1% sequentially and 4% lower than the prior year due to 19 orders representing $40 million that aged beyond 30 months, which we do not include in our reported backlog. In Q2, we had 3 orders that aged in for approximately $5 million and contributed to product revenue within the quarter. Finally, we had no order cancellations in the quarter. Our overall gross margin for the quarter was 33.5%, compared to 37.4% in the prior year. As you may recall, we experienced a onetime cost benefit in Q1 related to lower parts consumption due to the ERP implementation and expected it to offset in Q2 as reflected in our results. Gross margin for the first-half was 35.7%, which was slightly below the first half of the prior year, mainly due to product mix. We expect gross margins to improve in the second half as we realize better service pricing along with the full benefit of restructuring actions taken in Q2. Operating expenses in the second quarter were $39.9 million, compared to $40.3 million in the prior year, down 1%. Excluding ERP implementation costs and severance payouts, operating expenses were down 8% to the prior year, illustrating continued cost discipline and focus on return on investment. Operating income for the quarter was negative $4 million compared to an operating gain of $2.7 million from the prior year due to lower standard margins, severance and ERP implementation costs. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2 million compared to $8.5 million from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first-half of fiscal year '24 was $8.5 million versus $10.4 million in the prior year with the decrease mainly driven by lower product volume. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in the second half with the full benefit of the restructuring actions taken in Q2 along with higher product revenue volume. We described the reconciliation between GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release issued today. Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term restricted cash amounted to $73 million compared to $77 million at the end of last quarter. Net accounts receivable were approximately $77 million, flat to the prior quarter. We are very pleased with the strong focus on collections, which resulted in a DSO of 66 days compared to 71 days in the prior year. Our net inventory balance was $155 million, up $5 million from the prior quarter due to the timing of system shipments. Our teams are continuing to focus on optimizing working capital to improve our cash position. In summary, we are pleased with our Q2 results and are reiterating our full-year FY ‘24 guidance of $460 million to $470 million on revenue and $27 million to $30 million on adjusted EBITDA. With total revenue of $211 million and adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 million in the first-half, we're expecting a very strong second-half with revenue in the range of $250 million to $260 million, driven by executing on our strong backlog, new product introductions and service growth and adjusted EBITDA of $18.5 million to $21.5 million, resulting from higher product volume and our margin expansion efforts starting to deliver. As a reminder, the full-year guidance we provided last August, assumed in part, FX staying consistent with our assumptions coming into the fiscal year. However, year-to-date in fiscal year '24, we have particularly seen the Japanese yen continue to weaken versus the beginning of fiscal year '24. This is noteworthy, given the strong product volume we're expecting to contribute to revenue in the second-half from the Japan region. We are closely monitoring FX as it pertains to our full year guidance and we'll update you again in the spring. Additionally, as stated in our last earnings call, the timing of our new product introductions, along with the recognition of the China margin deferrals will result in a greater amount of revenue and margins being recognized in Q4. With that in mind, we expect third quarter revenue performance to be in the range of $112 million to $118 million with an expected adjusted EBITDA range of $6 million to $9 million. Those are our key financial highlights. And with that, I'd like to hand the call back to Suzanne.\nSuzanne Winter: Thank you, Ali. In closing, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and pipeline of innovation. We have exciting growth catalysts and high-impact commercialization strategies that we believe will allow us to deliver above-market growth over time. Operationally, we remain laser-focused on capital deployment, improving margins and profitability while strengthening our balance sheet so that we maximize financial flexibility and create shareholder value. I would like to end by thanking our entire Accuray team for their dedication and passion. We know that the work we do makes a major difference in the lives of the patients we serve. Together, we are moving the organization forward and fulfilling our company mission of creating a better future for people diagnosed with cancer. I will now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMarie Thibault: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, Suzanne and Ali. I wanted to start here, I guess, on the guidance. You talked about a big second half and noted that with your fiscal third quarter guidance, it's implying a rather large bolus in fiscal fourth quarter. Help me understand what gives confidence in that? What are kind of the inputs from the various geographies that you're most excited about? And -- yes, I guess, I'll leave it there on the first question.\nSuzanne Winter: Yes. No, thanks, Marie. Yes, so there are a couple of major drivers of the guidance and really our confidence in the Q4. One for sure is the Tomo C. We have just a tremendous order quarter in China. And really, Q4 is about the time where customers are going from order to delivery. And so we believe Q4 will be heavily weighted as a result of the Tomo C. The other is VitalHold. Again, we had very strong VitalHold introduction in Japan. And so we do expect that there will be shipments related to those new orders that come in Q4. And then there is some seasonality and customer timing around Japan. They have a very strong Q4. So those three things really have weighted our Q4. And then just from an EBITDA perspective, with Tomo C delivery is the China margin deferral that we would recognize then in Q4. And also we'll see the full benefit of some of the restructuring actions that we've taken.\nMarie Thibault: Okay. And that all starts to hit there. And remind me on Tomo C, I think we were waiting on a treatment planning system approval. Has that been secured at this point? Or is that something we're still waiting on?\nSuzanne Winter: We're still waiting on it. And that also adds a little bit to the Q4. We were expecting at the end of March, it is looking like it's going to be either in the April or early May time frame.\nMarie Thibault: Okay. And you'll be able to start recognizing revenue after that comes in?\nSuzanne Winter: Correct.\nMarie Thibault: Okay. Okay. And then sorry for my second question here. Glad to hear that some of the efforts you've made on service margin are paying off. Ali, would you say at this point, the service margin expansion efforts are sustainable? Or should we continue to think of that metric as a little bit lumpy? I know, of course, volumes and things can make a difference. So how should we be thinking about kind of a floor on that service margin?\nAli Pervaiz: Yes. Thanks for the question, Marie. So I would say our contract revenue is definitely something that is sticky and the pricing that we've introduced on our contract revenue is going to be something that's certainly sustainable going forward. And so that makes up the lion's share of our service revenue, so that will continue. What is, I guess, a little bit more, I'll call it, volatile quarter-over-quarter is revenue related to our installation, our training. And so that can really vary quarter-over-quarter. But really excited about is seeing this contract revenue grow. It grew about 6% for the half, and that's really going to continue to add to our top and bottom line.\nMarie Thibault: Okay, thank you for that great deal -- great detail appreciate the questions. Thanks\nAli Pervaiz: Thanks, Marie.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brooks O'Neil with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrooks O'Neil: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd love to get just any additional color you can offer on the response to Tomo C in China. And perhaps if you're seeing any response outside of China in any other market to be interesting to hear about that as well.\nSuzanne Winter: Thanks, Brooks. Yes, no, I think we're very pleased with 1 quarter under our belt since we've gotten the regulatory approval of the Tomo C. As we expected, there's some pent-up demand there from an order's perspective. But we actually have our entire China JV leadership team here this week. And so we're spending a lot of time with them getting, I think, details on how the next quarters look. And so we feel pretty confident that the market response is very strong. Again, it's a domestic-made product. We come into the market with a halo effect of our market share in the Type A markets. And again, this is a Helical product within the Type B segment. And so we think it's differentiated, and we've got the right commercial infrastructure in place to do very well.\nBrooks O'Neil: I was curious, any response in India? Or is it too early to say?\nSuzanne Winter: Okay. So sorry, that was the second part of your question. I think it's still early, but we did show the Helix at the India conference in Mumbai in November, and there was a good response to that. We're still waiting for regulatory approval to be able to build our orders funnel, but I think the response was very positive.\nBrooks O'Neil: Great. And then I'll just tack on one more is, obviously, you mentioned the 50% takeaway success you're having in the Japanese market. What's your feeling about your opportunity to achieve some competitive takeaways in any other market? I'm thinking most particularly about the United States.\nSuzanne Winter: Yes. No, thanks for the question. Yes, Japan definitely leads in terms of the overall percent of orders coming in that are competitive takeaways. In the Americas market, we are very firmly focused on trade-in, trade-up of our installed base, primarily because they're more aged systems. That being said, this past quarter, we did have some competitive takeaways. And so we do feel strong that we can compete and win. And even if it's not a replacement, every sale is competitive, Brooks. So every time we win, we feel good about our ability to be.\nBrooks O'Neil: Absolutely. That's great. Congratulations. I'm looking forward to the rest of the year.\nSuzanne Winter: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Suzanne Winter for any closing remarks.\nSuzanne Winter: Thank you, operator. This concludes our earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you again this spring for our fiscal 2024 3rd quarter earnings release. Thanks for joining the call."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jesse Chew, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead. \nJesse Chew : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Accuray's conference call to review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, which ended September 30, 2023. During our call this afternoon, management will review recent corporate developments. Joining us on today's call are Suzanne Winter, Accuray's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ali Pervaiz, Accuray's Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our call today includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated or implied by these forward-looking statements.

First, during the Q&A session, we request that participants limit themselves to two questions and then re-queue with any follow-ups. Second, all references to a specific quarter in the prepared remarks are to our fiscal year quarters. For example, statements regarding our first quarter refer to our fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, there will be a supplemental slide deck to accompany this call, which you can access by going directly to Accuray's investor relations page at investors.accuray.com.  With that, let me turn the call over to Accuray's Chief Executive Officer, Suzanne Winter. Suzanne. \nSuzanne Winter : Thank you, Jesse. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call. The Accuray team had a strong start to the fiscal year, delivering on both revenue and EBITDA in the quarter. We are making great progress toward our fiscal year 2024 priorities, which include achieving above market revenue growth through new product innovation and commercial execution; expanding margins and profitability through enhanced pricing and operating efficiencies; and competing more effectively by leveraging strategic partnerships in new product development and market access.  In the quarter, we saw continued customer adoption of Accuray's CyberKnife, Radixact and TomoTherapy platforms to enable advanced radiotherapy treatments like stereotactic radiosurgery and SBRT for patients around the world. This was driven by growth in demand for these treatment regimens, which require an extremely high degree of precision. Accuray systems are capable of delivering stereotactic radiotherapy treatments to targets anywhere in the body.  During the quarter, we grew global revenue by 8% year-over-year with product revenue growing 17% year-over-year, demonstrating better than expected customer demand in our first quarter versus the same period last year. As a reminder, revenue in radiation oncology, particularly in capital equipment, can vary from quarter to quarter, but we were encouraged by the strong start in Q1. Order backlog at $489 million is robust, representing greater than 2x fiscal year 2023 product revenue. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our strategic goals of faster growth in the market and gaining share this fiscal year and beyond.  We also expanded our installed base of customers within the quarter to 1,040 systems, representing 5% year-over-year growth. As we've discussed in the past, installed base growth is a critical key performance indicator for this long cycle business because it's directly linked to service contract revenue, which is initiated at the 13 month following an average warranty period. This service contract revenue continues annually for the subsequent 10 to 12 years and provides a long tail of recurring revenue. Additionally, installed customers also represent market opportunity for new feature upgrades as well as incremental services and support like advanced training, which will further expand our service business.  Finally, new order growth was also solid, outpacing product revenue shipments. While we don't guide on orders, we are very pleased to deliver to our 1.2 book to bill target. We see this as a strong metric to gauge future growth and grow our backlog.  In October, we participated in the American Society of Radiation Oncology Conference, or ASTRO, where attendance was at historic highs with over 9,000 attendees from the radiation oncology community. We were able to drive tremendous interest in our new product innovations designed to advance care in a premium segment of the market. We showcased our new VitalHold product, which strengthens our product portfolio for the treatment of breast cancer, adding surface-guided breast treatment capabilities to our current Radixact platform. This product comes from a successful development partnership with C-RAD.  Additionally, we introduced Alliance-Plus value-added service and support solutions to help ensure customers maximize the clinical and operational potential of their equipment. Further, we announced Accuray Financial Services, which provides a full range of flexible financing options to customers for capital equipment acquisition.  Finally and most exciting, we unveiled our latest introduction to the Radixact, the Cenos online adaptive capability. Cenos leverages artificial intelligence, or AI, to provide automatic contouring algorithms and remote clinical collaboration capabilities for the specific patient cases where there is an immediate need for a change in a treatment plan. Accuray's Cenos is designed to provide a faster and more practical approach to refining treatment plans compared with other industry offerings. Cenos was developed with our partnership with Limbus AI, a leading healthcare technology company that specializes in the creation of AI-based algorithms to advance cancer care.  With the addition of Cenos, we believe that the Radixact system can help ensure that treatments change as patients change, to minimize dose to healthy tissue and personalize treatment. First with Synchrony, which is designed to track, detect and correct treatment delivery due to motion that occurs during treatment. Second with PreciseART offline tools to manage changes to treatment plans needed between treatment sessions. And now with the addition of Cenos online adaptive, clinicians have the ability to modify a treatment plan on the day of treatment, based on patient changes detected on the daily imaging scan.  We believe that our comprehensive adaptive tool set, including Cenos, will be a key differentiator for Accuray Radixact versus competitive products and expect it to further increase our win rates and momentum for upgrading the aged TomoTherapy installed base. Cenos is 510(k) pending, and we expect to have this product available for customer order in the spring of 2024.  Overall, in speaking and surveying the U.S. radiation oncology community, it was clear there was a positive outlook, backed by technology developments and emerging clinical data that demonstrate the curative impact of high precision, personalized radiation therapy. This gives us confidence that the long-term future for radiation oncology is very strong, despite some short-term headwinds due to the higher installation costs and longer cycles that have delayed some projects in the U.S.  During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our second growth pillar of improving patient access in global segments where radiation therapy is underpenetrated and where workflow and patient throughput is a critical priority to manage the large patient backlog. In early October, we gained regulatory clearance for our domestic manufactured Tomo C platform focused on the Type B segment in China. This represents a key milestone for Accuray. This approval unlocks the ability for our China team to drive orders and build backlog in the Type B market segment, which represents approximately $600 million in annual market opportunity. Shipments to customers are expected to occur in fiscal Q4, pending availability of the Precision Treatment Planning System.  We believe Tomo C will become a major contributor to our China business as we now have access to the Type B market. The Type B market is the largest and fastest growing segment compared to the Type A segment where we have dominant market share today. Tomo C is differentiated as the only CT product with helical delivery available in China, and we expect strong commercial execution from our China team.  You may have also heard that we announced at our Investor Day at ASTRO the preliminary introduction of Helix, our global value segment product at the Indian Cancer Congress meeting that was held last week in Mumbai, India. The introduction of Helix, which is designed and manufactured in Madison, Wisconsin, is another strong addition to our product portfolio to target this high-potential, underserved market. With Tomo C and Helix, we can now compete in the growing global value market segment and double the addressable market potential with tailored product solutions that are designed for the unique needs of high-potential emerging markets.  Within the quarter, we were also proud to announce a strategic win at the Royal Marsden in the U.K., which we believe will further strengthen our brand. In our business, brand reputation is extremely important as customers make investments in technology and long-term partnerships that last for many years. The Royal Marsden is a global thought leader in radiation medicine and also the principal investigator site for the PACE trial for prostate cancer.  At ASTRO, the Royal Marsden team presented groundbreaking 5-year follow-up data from the PACE-B trial that compared prostate cancer outcomes for 5-session SBRT treatment with conventional radiation therapy delivered in 20 sessions. These results are expected to have a significant clinical impact and drive adoption of SBRT as the new standard of care for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer based on its benefit to patients. This study essentially eliminates the burden of time and cost for 15 additional treatment sessions.  The Royal Marsden just completed the purchase of their second Radixact system this year, adding to the 2 CyberKnife systems currently in their equipment fleet. This represents just one of the wins which we believe are significant for Accuray because they demonstrate that clinical innovation powered by high precision technology is becoming essential to providing advanced care. Accuray technology is uniquely positioned to deliver stereotactic radiosurgery and SBRT and is driving preference at top cancer centers around the world.  During the quarter, I was also very pleased with our operational performance. We continue to drive margin improvement through commercial execution by gaining price for our innovations and by reducing costs through operational rigor and greater efficiencies across every area of our business. Last quarter and at our Investor Day in October, we discussed cost optimization as a pillar in our profitability expansion plan. Last week, we announced a restructuring, which included a 6% reduction of our workforce across the organization. While these decisions are always difficult, we are confident that these actions to simplify our organization, in combination with improved processes from our investment in a new ERP system which went live during the quarter, will strengthen our position for the future and is in line with the plan we laid out last year when Ali and I took over.  Additionally, we will focus investments in areas that are critical to our growth strategy, like commercial and customer support resources, to maximize our latest product innovations and to further drive our market position and customer adoption. These actions will put Accuray in the strongest position to navigate the macro environment, invest in strategic areas of revenue and margin growth, and create long-term shareholder value.  Finally, in Q1, we further enhanced our executive team with the hiring of new leadership in R&D, global service and support, and IT and cybersecurity. These executives come with significant operating experience from such leading companies in our sector is Varian, GE Healthcare and ABB. We will be leveraging their leadership experience to further position the company to win and gain share through innovation and unparalleled service and support.  I will now turn it over to Ali, who will speak more about our financial performance. \nAli Pervaiz : Thank you, Suzanne, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our global employees and cross-functional teams who executed with dedication to deliver a solid first quarter while also undergoing a full-scale ERP implementation, which presented quite a few operational and reporting challenges as part of the go-live and data migration process. Despite these expected challenges and learning how to navigate a brand new ERP environment, the teams worked around the clock to ensure a successful implementation, which we are all very proud of. Our new ERP system will be able to provide us with the right data-driven visibility to run the business in a more efficient and cost effective manner.  Turning to the financials. Net revenue for the first quarter was $104 million, which was up 8% versus the prior year. Net revenue on a constant currency basis for the first quarter was $103 million, which represents a 6.5% increase versus the prior year.  Product revenue for the first quarter was $53 million, up 17% from the prior year and up 15% on a constant currency basis, representing system shipments of 24 units, which is a 14% increase versus the prior year.  Service revenue for the quarter was $51 million, down 1% from the prior year and down 1% on a constant currency basis with an increase in contract revenue being offset by lower installation, training and spare parts revenue, which we expect to bounce back in Q2.  Product gross orders for the first quarter were approximately $64 million and represented a book to bill ratio of 1.2. As a reminder, our book to bill ratio is defined as gross orders for the period divided by product revenue for the period. As Suzanne mentioned, we believe the book to bill ratio is the right metric to ensure healthy growth for our backlog and is also a good indicator of future business vitality.  Moving to the backlog. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of approximately $489 million, which represents greater than 2 years of FY 2023 product revenue. This reported backlog is 9% lower than prior year due to 14 orders representing $31 million that aged beyond 30 months, which we do not include in our report backlog. It is important to note that these orders aged out primarily related to customer timing, and we fully expect these to convert to revenue in the coming quarters. In Q1, we had 4 previously aged out orders for approximately $9 million contribute to product revenue. Finally, we had 4 order cancellations of $9 million in the quarter, all coming from the Japan region due to a termination of a distributor, which we expect to win back through our existing distributors in the coming quarters.  Our overall gross margin for the quarter was 38% compared to 35.9% in the prior year, primarily due to lower parts consumption and associated freight expenses versus last year. Q1 gross margin was up 6.1 points versus the prior quarter, primarily due to lower service parts consumption and freight. It's important to note that service parts consumption was lower in Q1, partially due to the timing of the ERP implementation within the quarter, providing a one-time cost benefit in Q1, which we expect to be offset in Q2.  Operating expenses in the first quarter were $37.3 million compared to $36.8 million in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Operating income for the quarter was $2.2 million compared to an operating loss of $2.2 million from the prior year.  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $6.5 million compared to $1.9 million from the prior year. We described the reconciliation between GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release issued today.  Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term restricted cash amounted to $77 million compared to $90 million at the end of last quarter with the decrease primarily driven by lower unit shipments compared to prior quarter. Net accounts receivable were approximately $77 million, up $3 million from the prior quarter. Our net inventory balance was $150 million, up $5 million from the prior quarter due to lower shipments in Q1. Our teams are continuing to focus on optimizing working capital to improve our cash position.  In summary, we are pleased with our Q1 results and are reiterating our full year FY 2024 guidance range of $460 million to $470 million on revenue and $27 million to $30 million on adjusted EBITDA. We expect first half revenue performance to be approximately 45% of the range of our guidance with a stronger second half as some of our new product introductions start to contribute to revenue. Given the timing of our new product introductions, along with the restructuring actions we took in October that will contribute to lower OpEx in the second half, we expect our EBITDA performance in the first half of fiscal 2024 to equate to approximately 30% of the range of our guidance.  Those are key the financial highlights. And with that, I'd like to hand the call back to Suzanne. \nSuzanne Winter : Thank you, Ali. I'm very pleased with our Q1 results and our strong start to the year. We are now offering the broadest and most innovative product portfolio in our company's history and are poised to capitalize on promising clinical trends and opportunities in the competitive landscape. We have a defined revenue and margin expansion plan, and we are executing.  Finally, we have an incredible leadership team in place that I believe is second to none in the industry. In closing, I would like to thank the entire Accuray team for the strong Q1 performance, the meaningful progress we have made against our strategic priorities and their ongoing dedication and passion to advancing our mission and creating value for all stakeholders.  I will now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Young Li with Jefferies. \nYoung Li : I guess to start, maybe just with guidance. I mean, very strong results this quarter, but you're holding guidance -- it's 1 quarter into the fiscal year. I just wanted to understand, I guess, the level of conservatism embedded in that guidance reiteration. And maybe if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing for the order funnel into the rest of the year. \nSuzanne Winter : Thanks for the question, Young. And yes. No, I think we've had a very strong start here in Q1, and I would say that we're cautiously optimistic. At the same time, we don't want to get too much ahead of ourselves. A couple of things that I think we're taking a look at is both U.S. and China. U.S., I think as we talked about here, there was some slowing and some extended sales cycles. And so we expect that that will improve in the back half of the year. And of course, some of the discussion in China from the anti-corruption campaign, we also expect to resolve itself in the back half of the year. But of course, we're taking a look at that. We will know more as we get into the first half of the year and take a look at our guidance. But I mean overall, we feel very good about our performance and the new products that we have introduced at ASTRO, the customer response and the momentum, as well as what we are seeing operationally in terms of our margin improvement. So I would say that we are taking a more conservative approach to how we take a look at guidance, and we will know more in the next quarter. \nYoung Li : Great. Very helpful. And I guess for my follow-up, maybe just on the China Tomo C opportunity. The approval came a few months earlier than expected. There's some numbers in the guidance. I guess I'm just kind of wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit more about the contribution this year, the plan for launch. And how has the tone been so far since approval? \nSuzanne Winter : Yes. Yes. No, sounds good. No, the Tomo C is a very large growth catalyst for our business. We are very excited about the approval of the Tomo C. It did come in a little bit earlier than expected, which is fantastic. What that means is that now our China team can begin to take customer orders and build the backlog. And so they are doing that now. We've already had an internal launch ceremony in China where we had local Tianjin government officials. It was a very big event. And so I think there's a lot of anticipation and excitement around the product, partially because it's the only product in the Type B space that is domestic made that is a full CT helical delivery product. And so we believe the demand for the product is going to be strong.  So what we expect into Q2 and the back half of the year is, again, beginning to take orders for the Tomo C. And then, of course, from order to customer shipment, there are several months. And we expect that revenue will start to hit for Tomo C in Q4, and that's the shipments to customers. In the meantime, though, we will be shipping Tomo C to our partners so that they can start to begin building the product. We ship parts to our partner in Tianjin, and then they begin the manufacturing process and buildup of finished goods. So again, a lot of excitement around the approval of Tomo C. We think we'll have the opportunity to get great market traction as well as gain market share in the Type B space. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brooks O'Neil with Lake Street Capital Markets. \nBrooks O'Neil : Congratulations on a terrific start to the year. I'll try to keep it to 2 questions. The first one is inflation is a huge topic globally. Can you just talk a little bit about the pricing environment and then maybe comment briefly about whether inflation in general is a positive or a negative for you in your business? \nAli Pervaiz : Brooks, thanks for the question. I would tell you in general, in terms of inflation, we're certainly seeing that the supplier price increases have slowed down. I think that being said, we did see about a $2.5 million headwind related to inflation that hit our P&L this particular quarter. So it's certainly not eased up for us. We do have quite a few specialty supply parts that go into our products that certainly have more exposure to inflation. So it is definitely a topic that still remains for us, and we continue to monitor it really closely. \nBrooks O'Neil : Great. So my second question is, a couple of years ago, there was tremendous excitement about reimbursement changes that seemed to recognize both the patient and the provider benefits of your high-dose radiation therapy. Could you guys just give us a quick update on the state of any discussions about moving reimbursement in that patient and provider-friendly direction or not at this point? \nSuzanne Winter : Yes, Brooks. So we had our Investor Day at ASTRO. We had a couple of speakers that kind of gave the state of the state in the U.S. on where RO-APM was and what some of the changes are in reimbursement. And the RO-APM, as you know, was sort of put on hold, and we were waiting to see if there would be any movement. And the positive movement is that ASTRO has come up with their own reimbursement model which they are proposing that actually does take into account exactly making equity between shorter duration treatments like SBRT compared to conventional treatments so that the U.S. hospitals are not losing money by going to a more advanced care, which is the, again, the shorter duration treatments, which is better for the patient, better for the healthcare system overall. So that is a legislative process. So it probably will still take 1 year plus to be able to go through. But at least there's alignment from the industry, the ASTRO Industry Conference, and it's basically their design. So we are very hopeful not only in getting this through the legislative process, but also the signal that it sends to U.S. customers that this is the movement and it is toward the shorter duration treatments. And we see that as a positive thing for our technology. \nBrooks O'Neil : Absolutely. Makes sense. Looking forward to the rest of the year. \nSuzanne Winter : Thanks, Brooks. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neil Chatterji with B. Riley. \nBrandon Carney : This is Brandon Carney on for Neil. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I guess just first, maybe can you provide any update on the pending application for the Cenos online adaptive solution? And can you talk about any key feedback that you've received since the introduction at ASTRO? \nSuzanne Winter : Yes, thanks for the question. We had a lot of momentum and interest for Cenos. And we showed it for the first time in some private demos at the ASTRO conference, and I will tell you that the feedback was excellent. And we had a number of demonstrations, sign-ups, and we were standing room only, and they were all booked up really by the end of the first day. So we take that as a very positive sign. Now we went into the show with Cenos' 510(k) pending. Our expectations, just based on time lines, is that that will be available to order sometime in Q3 with shipments in the summertime. But the feedback was very positive. First of all, again, another tool to be able to make radiation therapy treatments more precise by adjusting to patient changes and this one being an online adaptive tool. Now there are adaptive tools that are out there in the marketplace, but they require a lot of resources. They require additional treatment time. And so really, we learned a lot from the feedback from the existing offerings on what to do differently in Cenos and what to improve upon. So that was the kind of feedback that we got from customers. So we're really excited about its ability to make a difference in patient care, but also differentiate the Radixact platform. \nBrandon Carney : That's helpful. I guess, and then maybe I can just ask for you to comment on the market potential for Helix in India and what kind of uptake you expect there. \nSuzanne Winter : I just want to make sure I heard you. The market potential for India? \nBrandon Carney : Yes. Yes. \nSuzanne Winter : Yes, yes, yes. So in India, we see that as another target site for value segment product, and that is with the introduction of the Helix. We think this is a product that is uniquely tailored for that value segment within India. And we think the opportunity is approximately $100 million to $150 million annually. And so we are going to be taking a look at the high-potential, high-growth emerging markets where Helix can do very well compared to competitive offerings. So we are excited about this being sort of our next focus after China. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Suzanne Winter for any closing remarks. \nSuzanne Winter : Very good. Thank you very much. Well, this concludes our earnings call. We look forward to speaking with all of you again in February for our fiscal year 2024 second quarter earnings release. Thanks very much. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
