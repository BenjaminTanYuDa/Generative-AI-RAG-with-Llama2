At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without permission from the company. I'd now like to introduce Felix Veksler, Senior Director of Investor Relations at Monro. Please go ahead.\nFelix Veksler: Thank you. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning’s call. Before we get started, please note that as part of this call, we will be referencing a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at corporate.monro.com/investors. If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two, I’d like to remind participants that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Monro’s future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monro’s filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Additionally, on today’s call, management’s statements include a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable GAAP measures will be included as part of today’s presentation and in our earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Monro’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Broderick.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, Felix and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend the first part of our call this morning walking through our third quarter performance, which reflected top line results that were challenged. This was due to milder weather as well as a pressured low to middle income consumer that continued to defer purchases in our high ticket tire category. This was clearly evidenced by an industry-wide slowdown in tire unit sales in the regions of the country where a vast majority of our store footprint is concentrated. We continued to mitigate the impact of this slowdown with actions to reduce non-productive labor costs. Despite a tough macroeconomic environment, the resiliency of our business model and the actions that we've taken allowed us to expand gross margin in the quarter. I'll also discuss our plans to deliver an improvement in our diluted earnings per share this fiscal year despite some of the consumer related headwinds that we and others in our industry are experiencing. Before I get started, I'd like to recognize and thank all our teammates for serving the needs of our customers. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Our third quarter comparable store sales declined approximately 6% from the prior year period. Comp store sales in our 300 small or underperforming stores were consistent with our overall comp in the quarter. As I stated earlier, our sales results in the quarter continue to be challenged by consumer deferrals of tire purchases as evidenced by an industry-wide slowdown in tire unit sales. This led to pressured store traffic which was not supportive to sales of our higher margin service categories in the quarter. While our tire units were down approximately 14%, leveraging the strength of our manufacturer funded promotions allowed us to optimize our assortment for improved tire profitability in the quarter. And while continued consumer trade down dynamics led to a higher proportion of lower margin opening price point tires within overall industry unit sales, we remained focused on maintaining a healthy mix of opening price point tires in the quarter. Encouragingly, based on retail sellout data from Torqata, a subsidiary of ATV, our tire market share remained broadly in line with the overall market in our higher margin tiers. We continue to mitigate this industry-wide slowdown in tires with actions to reduce non-productive labor costs, including overtime hours in our stores, which were down 25% year-over-year. This allowed us to expand gross margin even on lower sales volumes. We will continue to closely manage our labor costs and expense to maximize profitability. Now, concluding with our plans to deliver an improvement in our diluted earnings per share this fiscal year, despite a choppy consumer environment. While our preliminary comp store sales for fiscal January are down approximately 6% due to softness in the first half of the month, comps have accelerated materially in the last two weeks with the return of normal seasonal weather. We have some easier prior year compares in February and March. But given the current pressures on the consumer, we no longer expect to grow full year sales. However, we do expect full year diluted earnings per share to be higher versus prior year. This will be driven by actions we've taken to successfully reposition our cost structure, as well as expanding our gross margin through properly training our teammates to maximize their productivity and optimizing our tire assortment for improved profitability. We will continue to remain relentlessly focused on improving our 300 small or underperforming stores, maintaining a balanced approach between our tire and service categories with competitive pricing to drive store traffic, and continuously improving our customer experience. In addition, we will continue to create cash by optimizing inventory and leveraging the strength of our vendor partners for better availability, quality, and cost of parts and tires in our stores. In closing, despite the challenges posed by the current macroeconomic environment, our business continues to be well positioned, and we are confident that we remain on a path to restore our gross margins back to pre-COVID levels with double-digit operating margins over the longer term. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide an overview of Monro's third quarter performance, strong financial position, and additional color regarding the remainder of fiscal 2024. Brian?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide eight. Sales decreased 5.2% year-over-year to $317.7 million in the third quarter, which was primarily due to lower tire unit sales. Comparable store sales decreased 6.1%, and sales from new stores increased approximately $1 million. Gross margin increased 170 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from lower material costs and technician labor costs as a percentage of sales, which were partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Total operating expenses were $91.3 million, or 28.7% of sales, as compared to $89.6 million, or 26.7% of sales in the prior year period. The increase as a percentage of sales was principally due to lower year-over-year comparable store sales. Operating income for the third quarter declined to $21.4 million, or 6.7% of sales. This is compared to $23.8 million, or 7.1% of sales in the prior year period. Net interest expense decreased to $5 million, as compared to $5.9 million in the same period last year. This was principally due to a decrease in weighted average debt. Income tax expense was approximately $4.2 million or an effective tax rate of 25.8%, which is compared to $5 million or an effective tax rate of 27.6% in the prior year period. Net income was approximately $12.2 million as compared to $13 million in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.38 compared to $0.41 for the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.39. And this is compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Please refer to our reconciliation of adjusted diluted EPS in this morning's earnings press release, and on slide eight in our earnings presentation for further details regarding excluded items in the third quarter of both fiscal years. As highlighted on slide nine, we continue to maintain a very solid financial position. We generated $130 million of cash from operations during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, including $30 million in working capital reductions. This has reduced our cash conversion cycle by approximately 60 days at the end of the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the third quarter was 179% versus 178% at the end of fiscal 2023. We received $16 million in divestiture proceeds, and we invested $19 million in capital expenditures, spent $29 million in principal payments for financing leases, and distributed $27 million in dividends. Lastly, repurchases of our common stock were approximately $44 million under our share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to $150 million of the company's common stock. We've used our significant cash flow to reduce invested capital by $83 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. At the end of the third quarter, we had bank debt of $94 million, cash and cash equivalents of $24 million, and a net bank debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.5 times. While we're not providing guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2024, we are providing color to assist in your modeling. We expect lower year-over-year full year sales, inclusive of an extra week in our fourth quarter. We expect to drive year-over-year improvements in our gross margin through pricing actions, tire mix optimization, and productivity improvements from our labor investments, which will be partially offset by continued wage inflation. Total operating expenses at the percentage of sales are expected to be higher year-over-year due to increases in direct and departmental costs to support our store base, as well as the impact of inflation and lower sales volume. Our tax rate should be approximately 25% for fiscal 2024. Regarding our capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2024. We also expect to continue improving our operating cash flow driven by continued working capital reductions. Our balanced approach of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as well as opportunistically completing value-enhancing acquisitions, is expected to meaningfully increase our return on invested capital. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike for some closing remarks.\nMichael Broderick: Thanks Brian. We remain laser-focused on our initiatives to improve sales, expand margins, and create cash. Although we still have important work to do, we are well-positioned to execute our growth strategy and deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lantz from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lantz: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I was just curious if you could talk about the quarter-to-day comp trends in a bit more detail. It sounds like the first half of January was pretty challenging, but the second half has improved a lot, so I was just curious about that.\nMichael Broderick: David, good morning. This is Mike. Just to give you clarity on what we're seeing, the first two weeks were very soft, driven by a shift in the holiday. So, I basically gained two Sundays, but lost two very important Mondays, and I do much more business on Monday, so that contributed to a soft comp. And then it was just a continuon of a weather story and the tire story. As soon as the weather came back, which happened in the last two weeks of the month, everything normalized. Our tire business came back. Our business turned in a very different position. And the way we characterized it was a significant difference between the first two weeks and the second two weeks.\nDavid Lantz: Got it. That's helpful. And then gross margins were a standout in the quarter, so I was just curious if you could talk through what's structural there and how many much -- how many overtime hours you have to reduce still and what kind of lever that could be.\nMichael Broderick: Sure. This is Mike again. Just -- when you look at the material margins, that partly was contributed to the decisions we made around the change in our tire assortment. So, the team really did a nice job bringing to life our tier one through three as we've talked about in the past. That was a more profitable tire, better tire for our customer. Number two is when we look at the tire decline, obviously our service categories drive a higher margin, so that contributed to it. And last but not least, the team did a really great job of controlling payroll. When you look at overtime, actually we were down year-over-year, but sequentially we actually invested in overtime in order to meet some of the customer demands. And I really pay attention to that because I never want to cap our sales. So, we've talked about this in the past. I'll invest in overtime. I'll invest in our people in order to meet demand. And I continue to do that, but ultimately what we're focused on is non-productive payroll, making sure our technicians are earning their fair wages and our customers are being served.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Just to follow up on that to give -- put some numbers to the pieces that Mike described, the material cost benefit was about 190 basis points in the quarter for the reasons Mike explained. The technician benefit, technician labor cost as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points year-over-year. And we did see a 60 basis point headwind related to distribution and occupancy costs as they delevered on lower comp sales. That nets out to the 170 basis point margin improvement.\nDavid Lantz: Got it. Thanks guys. That's super helpful.\nMichael Broderick: Thanks David.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bret Jordan at Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nMichael Broderick: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Could you break out -- in the composition of car count versus price?\nMichael Broderick: Sure. When we look at our overall car count, it was down 8%. Price was up, average sales price was up 3%. Let me go deeper into that. On tire, we were down 14% in units, up 5% in ticket. Once again, going back to our mix change that we started last January. When I look at our service business, it was basically down 3% and average ticket was flat. I do want to call out this P&L would look much different, much different if we ran down 3%. The team is doing a good job controlling expenses, contributing -- moving our margins in the right direction. And I feel confident that now that we have most of the OPP tire conversation behind us, now we've lapped it a year, I feel confident we get back to a more normal conversation around our tire assortment. And I'm looking forward to a more normal customer environment where we get this thing growing again.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then the contribution from working capital, sort of what's left in that tank as far as incremental cash to squeeze off the balance sheet?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Yeah. Bret, as we talked about on the last call, we're in the later innings of that, but there's still opportunity. So, we think that our cash flow will continue to be supported by not only the profit growth, but also working capital improvements. Certainly don't expect to give back any of that working capital and believe that there's additional benefit to come.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And Brian, could you give us the monthly costs?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Sure. Down 5.7% in October, down 6.6% in November, down 5.6% in December, and then the preliminary January month to date down 6%.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMichael Broderick: Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Nagel: I guess my first question is probably a bit of a follow-up. But just with regard to weather, I mean, look, it's no secret that we had a warm start to the winter, so to say. But could you help us understand better the actual impact of that upon comp sales? And then also, you called out again the sluggish consumer. I mean, maybe we're starting to get some signals out there that overall consumer confidence is maybe starting to improve. So, the question I have for you is behind all this noise, are you seeing some indication that maybe with your consumer experience, the confidence is improving, the delayed purchases are getting less so?\nMichael Broderick: Yeah. Brian, let me -- this is Mike. Let me -- I don't want to give weekly cadence. I would say that the entire business we've talked about in the past, we were looking for a weather event. I wish we had it in the third quarter. We'd sure have made a different result. But when it did come, it changed dramatically. So, just like what we've talked about in the past, weather did contribute to a significant tire change. I would look at the consumer and what we're still seeing are customers that used to buy four tires that are trading down to two tires and doing one tire now. So, we are still seeing that deferral cycle. And until I see anything differently, I would probably say the consumer is in a rough patch. I should be able to see a consumer that is replacing two tires minimum. They should not be just replacing one tire. And I'm just using that as an example to say, hey, there's something there with the consumer for these high ticket tires.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks Mike.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Imbro at Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nJoe Enderlin: Hey, guys. This is Joe Enderlin. I'm for Daniel. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Broderick: Morning, Joe.\nJoe Enderlin: Morning. Commentary in the release says you maintain share in those higher margin tiers. Still seems like some movement in the opening price point. Have you seen the pace of that share movement slow?\nMichael Broderick: Well, just to be clear, the decisions we made last January, we knew we were going to lose market share and we were going to give up units in opening price point. That was a decision not just with price, but with assortment. The one thing that we did not factor on, and we didn't see that in the prior two years that I was here, is tier one through three declining. That is something that, as an industry, we would never have factored in or forecasted. When I look at the customer behavior right now, without question, the customer definitely moved into tier four. But overall, tire units in the industry were down mid single digits. So, there's a very tough environment around the tire business right now, and I'm looking forward to that actually coming back. Once again, going back to the consumer environment right now, I would say it's shared by all.\nJoe Enderlin: Got it. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, could you provide some more color on how those 300 underperforming stores did versus your expectations for the quarter?\nMichael Broderick: Versus expectations? They missed expectations. They actually were very consistent with the rest of my chain. There was a lot of variability in the performance in those 300 stores. I would say one-third were extremely successful, one-third met expectations, and one-third fell short of my expectations. And we continue to focus on driving profitable sales through those boxes. I have talked about in prior quarters that having one or two transactions -- additional transactions with tires could significantly change the comp on some of these low volume stores. Just to kind of illustrate how variable some of these stores' P&L and sales performance really is.\nJoe Enderlin: That's helpful. Thank you, guys.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Bret Jordan at Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey, guys. I think you not too long ago made an announcement about a parts supply deal you did with a group. Could you talk about that? Does it have any impact or material impact on margin, or is it just an incremental parts supply deal in addition to the ones you already had with some of the big two-step guys?\nMichael Broderick: There is -- we did make a deal. I would say it's incremental, but there's nothing in this quarter to talk about. And there's no margin that I would say would be something I would call out. It just gives our team another option in case they're trying to look for parts, so they can better serve their customers.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then I guess a little bit more detail on the labor cost reduction comment. I think you said it was something in the 40 basis points benefit. Is it just reduction in labor hours or an absolute reduction in headcount? Sort of what are the big levers you can pull on the labor cost side of things?\nMichael Broderick: Yeah. We did a little bit of both, but ultimately what we did is we reduced hours so that we could -- and we just really managed hours very tightly, considering that we had a tight sales environment. And the way we did that is through less people, but more importantly, we just really restricted the hours so that we were really flexible when the customers did come into our stores. We just managed the schedule. Going back a couple of years ago, I would say from a Monro perspective, we invested in tools, scheduling tools, to allow us to better manage our people, and the team is adapting to it. And they're doing a great job managing our biggest cost, which is our technicians.\nBret Jordan: Yeah. Great. Thank you.\nMichael Broderick: Thanks Bret.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions on the line, so I will hand the call back to Michael Broderick for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nMichael Broderick: Thank you for joining us today. This continues to be an exciting time to be part of Monro. We have a strong foundation to build upon to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes the conference call. Thank you all very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Monro’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Broderick.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, Felix, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend the first part of our call this morning walking through our second quarter performance, which reflected top line results that were challenged. This was due to consumers deferring tire purchases as persistent inflationary pressures impacted purchases of higher ticket items across the retail spectrum. This was clearly evidenced by an industry-wide slowdown entire unit sales in the regions of the country where a vast majority of our store footprint is concentrated. We mitigated this slowdown with actions to reduce non-productive labor costs, including overtime hours in our stores. Despite a tough macroeconomic environment, the resiliency of our business model allowed us to expand gross margin and maintain our year-over-year profitability even on a lower tire sales volume. I'll also discuss our plans to deliver improved earnings this fiscal year despite some of the consumer related headwinds that we and others in our industry are experiencing. Before I get into the specifics, I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to recognize and thank all of our teammates for their continued dedication to Monro, serving the needs of our customers as well as their positive contributions to the communities where we operate. Now turning to our second quarter results. Our second quarter comparable store sales declined approximately 2%. Comp store sales were down approximately 1% in our 300 small or underperforming stores, and down approximately 2% in our remaining store locations. As I stated earlier, our sales results in the quarter were challenged by consumer deferrals of tire purchases as evidenced by industry-wide slowdown entire unit sales in the regions of the country where a vast majority of our store footprint is concentrated. This led to pressured store traffic, which was not supportive to sales of our higher margin service categories in the quarter. While our tire units were down approximately 10%, leveraging the strength of our manufacturer funded promotions allowed us to optimize our assortment for improved tire profitability in the quarter. And while continued consumer trade-down dynamics led to a higher proportion of lower margin opening price point tires within overall industry unit sales, we remain focused on maintaining a healthy mix of opening price point tires in the quarter. Encouragingly based on the retail sellout data from Torqata, a subsidiary of ATD, we maintained our tire market share in our higher margin tiers. We mitigated this industry-wide slowdown in tires with actions to reduce non-productive labor costs, including overtime hours in our stores, which were down 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. This allowed us to expand gross margin and maintain our year-over-year profitability even on lower tire sales volumes. We will continue to closely manage our labor costs and expenses to maximize profitability, now concluding with our plans to deliver improved earnings this fiscal year despite a choppy consumer environment. While our preliminary comp store sales for fiscal October are down approximately 5%, our stores are properly staffed and ready for the back half of the year. And while we will need to see an improvement in the overall health of the consumer before we can fully capitalize on longer term industry tailwinds, we have successfully repositioned our cost structure to deliver improved profitability even on lower comp store sales. We will remain relentlessly focused on achieving comp store sales growth through accelerating growth in our 300 small or underperforming stores, maintaining a balanced approach between our tire and service categories with competitive pricing to drive store traffic and continuously improving our customer experience. We'll also strive to expand our gross margins through properly training our teammates to maximize their productivity. However, given the current pressures on the consumer, we are also laser-focused on maximizing profitability through prudent cost control, which concludes right sizing our fixed costs and rationalizing unproductive labor. While we take these actions, we will not cut productive labor at the sacrifice of our standards and to the detriment of our long-term service model. In addition, we will continue to create cash by optimizing inventory and leveraging the strength of our vendor partners for better availability, quality and cost of parts and tires in our stores. In closing, despite the challenges posed by the current macroeconomic environment, our business continues to be well-positioned and we are confident that we remain on a path to restore our gross margins back to pre-COVID levels with double-digit operating margins over the longer term. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide an overview of Monro's second quarter performance, strong financial position, and additional color regarding fiscal 2024. Brian?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide eight, sales decrease 2.3% year-over-year to $322.1 million in the second quarter, which was primarily due to lower tire unit sales. Comparable store sales decreased 2.3%, and sales from new stores increased approximately $1.2 million. Gross margin increased 30 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from lower material costs as a percentage of sales, which were partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, as well as higher technician labor costs as a percentage of sales due to wage inflation. Total operating expenses were $92.6 million or 28.8% of sales as compared to $93.3 million or 28.3% of sales in the prior year period. The increase as a percentage of sales was principally due to lower year-over-year comparable store sales. Operating income for the second quarter declined to $22.4 million or 6.9% of sales. This is compared to $23.5 million or 7.1% of sales in the prior year period. Net interest expense decreased to $4.8 million as compared to $5.7 million in the same period last year. This was principally due to a decrease in weighted average debt. Income tax expense was approximately $4.7 million or an effective tax rate of 26.8%, which is compared to $4.7 million or an effective tax rate of 26.6% in the prior year period. Net income was approximately $12.9 million as compared to $13.1 million in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.40 compared to $0.40 for the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.41. This is compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Please refer to our reconciliation of adjusted diluted EPS in this morning's earnings press release and on slide eight in our earnings presentation for further details regarding excluded items in the second quarter of both fiscal years. As highlighted on slide nine, we continue to maintain a very solid financial position. We generated $98 million of cash from operations during the first half of fiscal 2024, including $36 million in working capital reductions. This has reduced our cash conversion cycle by approximately 72 days at the end of the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the second quarter was 191% versus 178% at the end of fiscal 2023. We received $7 million in the divestiture proceeds. We invested $16 million in capital expenditures, spent $20 million in principal payments for financing leases, and distributed $18 million in dividends. Lastly, given the higher interest rate environment, we opted to paydown some of our debt in the second quarter to reduce interest expense versus repurchasing shares under our program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to $150 million of the company's common stock. We have used our significant cash flow to reduce invested capital by $71 million during the first half of fiscal 2024. At the end of the second quarter, we had bank debt of $55 million cash and cash equivalents of $9 million and a net bank debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.3 times. While we're not providing full year guidance, we are providing color to assist in your modeling. We expect to drive higher year-over-year sales through comparable store sales growth and outsized performance in our 300 small or underperforming stores. This is inclusive of an extra week of sales in our fiscal fourth quarter. We expect to drive year-over-year improvements in our gross margin through pricing actions, lower fixed distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to a higher sales base and productivity improvements from our labor investments and reductions from non-productive payroll, which will be partially offset by continued wage inflation. Total operating expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be higher year-over-year due to increases in direct and departmental costs to support our store base, as well as the impact of inflation. Our tax rate should be approximately 26% for fiscal 2024. Regarding our capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $35 million to $45 million in fiscal 2024. We also expect to continue improving our operating cash flow driven by continued working capital reductions, our balanced approach of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as well as opportunistically completing value enhancing acquisitions as expected to meaningfully increase our return on invested capital. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike for some closing remarks.\nMichael Broderick: Thanks Brian. We're optimistic about our outlook for fiscal 2024 and beyond. Although we still have important work to do, we remain well-positioned to execute our growth strategy and deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from the line of David Lantz of Wells Fargo. David, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nDavid Lantz: Hey, good morning guys, and thanks for taking my questions. So you're guiding the comparable sales growth in fiscal 2024 and in the context of October comps being down 5%, curious if you can talk about your expectations for the balance of the year, and if any of that improvement assumes an overall improvement in the macro.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thanks for the question, David. This is Brian. If you look at our back half, I just want to remind everyone we've got an extra week in our fourth quarter, that for -- that extra week is about 2% on the annual comp. So that is factored into that commentary around comparable store sales growth for the year. But we do expect, and it factored into that comp store sales growth is improvement off of the down five trend we talked about in October. And I think that's driven by what we hope to be better consumer dynamics in our tier one through three tires, which we are expecting that weather and that supports a tire selling season in the back half will help to drive that inflection.\nDavid Lantz: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a longer term question. On getting back to the low double-digit EBIT margins, can you provide a glide path on what sort of improvement could be driven by gross margins and what else could come from SG&A?\nMichael Broderick: I'll start with the margin, David. I would say that we -- even in this quarter, considering our down sales, we were able to show margin improve. We do feel like that will continue to improve through assortment decisions and the right tire and service mix in our business. We feel like we've done a lot over the last 12 to 15 months to get ourselves in a position where we can clearly see what margin and going back to margin of pre-COVID levels and the fact that we have payroll very much in under control. The team has done a nice job responding to the environment, whether it's up or down, and mitigating some of the wage investments that we've had to put in place over the last two to three years.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: And just to add to that, David, if you think about margin at 35.7 for our second quarter that was driven year-over-year by 120 basis points of improvement in material costs as a percent of sales, and then offset by about 90 basis points of a combination of our D&O and labor, and largely call that 90 basis points deleverage on the lower sales. So if you -- if our planning assumptions around the top line to flat come true, then you look at that labor, and D&O deleverage is kind of dissipating. You put 90 basis points on top of the 35.7 and you start to get into the some meaningful gross margin improvement on the path to double-digit operating margins. But G&A has been a focus, and if you look at our G&A in the quarter, it was flat year-over-year from a dollar standpoint. It delevered a little bit because of the lower sales, but our focus is to continue to drive flat G&A year-over-year in order to try to gain as much flow through on the sales we're delivering. That's obviously our goal. And so far we've been able to offset a lot of the year-over-year inflation with efficiency gains in G&A.\nDavid Lantz: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning guys.\nMichael Broderick: Morning, Bret.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: Could you give us a little detail on car count, I guess ticket versus traffic in the comp and then I guess Brian, the usual, the monthly comp breakout?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: I'll start with the traffic. Traffic was down mid single digits, and the ticket was up low single digits, but I would say that for a minus two, but a lot of what we looked at was going back to the tire story. So just to be clear on the OPP, this was a tire quarter for sure. We were just down -- we mixed up, which we like mixing up to tier one through three. That's drives profit. And I would say that -- because the tire count was down, we actually lost some of the attachment too. So we do look forward to the consumer coming back in the quarter. Generally, we're waiting on a weather event right now in the month of November to drive the customer coming back, and then we'll appropriately drive the improved transactions as well as the attachment that goes along with it.\nBret Jordan: Okay.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: And then regarding the cadence in the quarter, July was up 0.5, August was down 2.5, September down five. And those trends all really, like Mike said, driven by tire unit declines as the quarter went on and also consistent with the industry data that we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we were comparing ourselves against.\nBret Jordan: Was there much regional dispersion? I guess you guys kind of called out that your primary markets saw a lot of pressure from the consumer. Was the West better?\nMichael Broderick: The West was better, but I would say it's marginally better. But to our prepared remarks, a lot of the pressure was definitely on the East Coast.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then one final question. I guess, the working capital benefit, when you think about how you're running with sort of an inventory lighter model, what's -- what do you think is left? Like what's if -- as we look at the balance sheet today and the model, like what more could we extract from the inventory on cash?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Great question. I think if you look at Q1 to Q2, you definitely heard the metrics start to flatten out a little bit. We're still at about 72 days of cash conversion cycle reduction still around 190, 195 of that inventory to AP ratio or AP to inventory ratio. So I think you're -- it's definitely showing that we're in some of the later innings, but there's still more benefit to come as we get new vendors signed up for extended terms and also continue to drive volume through our existing vendors on the programs. But I think the slowdown in some of the growth in the year-over-year metrics is indicative of kind of later innings.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Dossett: Hey, this is William Dossett on for Brian. Thanks for taking my question.\nMichael Broderick: Good morning, William.\nWilliam Dossett: So -- thank you. So the first question is just about the consumer. What can you do internally to drive comps and gain increased traction if the consumer remains pressured? And with respect to the industry, what pressures need to ease for us to see an improvement in the current trade-down trends and deferral trends that you're seeing here?\nMichael Broderick: Yeah. So William, this is Mike. I'll take it. Regarding your first question, we talked about this in Q4 also the fact that we decided not to literally shift our mix to OPP, there was a lot of reasons for it. First of all, it wasn't profitable. We were making little money and we were spending quality wages on really expert technicians to be able to install cheap tires. That's not our business. And by the way, we actually saw customers who were buying those tires did not want to attach even though their cars required it. And that specifically hurt us on the brake category and some of the other service categories that we like and we actually -- that's our business model. That's number one. Number two. So what we did is we put price in and we reassorted our stores. We actually saw the fact that our assortment, it drives a profitable consumer that drives profit for our organization. We're able to manage our margins appropriately, and we're able to mitigate whatever expenses that we have just through oversight on overtime and some of the wage investments that we've put in place. So now what we're coming through is Q3 of last year, we have a lot of this in the marketplace. Q4, we really made the change where we were starting to get a balance mix. When I say balance mix, basically we wanted to have healthy growth in tier one through three, and the appropriate offering for tier four. At this point in time, when we're looking at the consumer -- to answer your second question, it's all about now a weather event to really drive a customer that's coming in. We do not see that customer. Literally, they're deferring, there's a high ticket, they're deferring. We see a weather event really changing the consumer. And when they come into our stores, we really look at this winter selling season as it's going to be very short. When it comes, it's going to come strong and we're well-positioned for it. Really coming into Q3 as well as in Q4, we actually see a lot of what we put in place in Q3 mitigating in Q4, where we can see now back to normal comps.\nWilliam Dossett: Okay. Yeah. That's very helpful. Thank you. And to follow up on that and to ask about the guidance for the full year, can you remind us what the compares are with the weather? And what gives you confidence that the weather can drive improved comps via just historical knowledge of the business? And also just with the full year comp, can you talk about the breakdown or your expectations between ticket and traffic?\nMichael Broderick: I'll start with the ticket and traffic. We generally focus on a balanced approach to it. So we do expect to have -- I mean, coming out of October, if we have a weather event, we have a heavy customer count growth. And then also the -- it shifts to tires, which is a large ticket item. And then we have to just manage the expenses. When I look at the comp for the rest of the year, I'm seeing that we're going to go through a tough November/December. We're going to -- if we have a winter event, we'll be able to mitigate our comp story. But Q4, which is -- Q4, it seems like we have -- we started this initiative in Q4, and the comps do get softer in Q4. And of course, we have a 53rd week that's also included in that.\nWilliam Dossett: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, William.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question today is from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Daniel, your line is now open.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for having our questions. I guess, I want to start again, Mike, maybe on the 300 small or underperforming stores. Obviously, they're seeing the same maybe deferrals and struggles as the rest of the industry, but I'm curious, just operationally, when you look across them, we've been improving those for about a year. They've generally done better than the stores. Like what's left to do from a self-help standpoint in those smaller stores? Can they grow without an industry turnaround, or from here are they kind of dependent on a similar macro improvement at those 300 underperforming stores?\nMichael Broderick: Daniel, when I look at the overall store performance, I focus on those underperforming stores as a double-digit growth opportunity for us. There's a lot of variability in that performance. I actually see a large subset of those stores that are performing extremely well. That gives me a lot of confidence that we're on the right path. It's a people story, it's a retail execution story. I would say this is always going to be something that we're going to focus on from the day I started with the organization. We always identified underperforming stores, poor performing stores. It's just part of retail. These stores are located in good areas. It's all about people. It's all about process. It's all about execution. And that's why it's always going to be part of our storyline of -- the reason why I feel confident that we can grow this company.\nDaniel Imbro: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe moving over on the market share side, I think your commentary said you retained share in the higher margin, higher tiers, but obviously I didn't hear a commentary in the lower end tiers. So is it just that we're seeing some competitors be price irrational out there on that opening price point, so you just don't maybe want to retain share there? And then based on history, just if you could share some context during periods of past macro pressure. I would guess opening price point, maybe gains a larger percentage of industry sales. Is that true? So maybe where you guys are losing share, is that going to maybe become a bigger part of the industry for the next few quarters if the macro keeps getting tougher?\nMichael Broderick: We don't see -- we saw -- first of all, just to go back to market share, we definitely decided not to over assort our stores with OPP tires. So it wasn't just about pricing, it was about assortment too. And there's a lot of reasons for it. We proved that out in Q4 that when selling we -- in Q3 when we -- of last year when we sold a lot of OPP tires, we didn't make a lot of money on it. When I look at market trends, I do believe that tier one through three have a position in the customer's from a customer lens. They absolutely have demand. We did not expect to have a soft tier one through three when we looked at this -- in our -- really our forecasting and our performance modeling, we do expect that business to come back and when that comes back, we're well-positioned for it. We have an OPP offering that tier four, we have it in our stores. It's priced right. It's just a question of we're not going to lean into it because when we lean into it, we saw that we don't make money. We saw customers trading down from 1, 2, 3 unnecessarily into tier four and we wanted to stop that because it wasn't good for the consumer.\nDaniel Imbro: That’s helpful color. And then last one, maybe Brian, just to follow up on Bret's question. Cash conversion has stabilized, cash flow maybe improves when sales do, but can you talk about how you're just thinking about uses of cash? Another quarter, I don't think you guys were active on the buyback, just where does that fit into your capital priorities? And maybe what are you guys looking forward to get more active on that use of cash? Thanks.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: No, thanks Daniel. We look at it as a balanced approach. Like, we are looking to continue to reduce our invested capital. And we talked about that being $70 million so far through the first six months approximately. And it's been more debt led right now. But if you look at the balance since we announced the buyback, it's been pretty much 50-50 in terms of debt reduction and share repurchase for the amount of total capital that -- invested capital that we've retired. So I would think that going forward over a period of time that's going to continue to be balanced, particularly as we start to get lower in the debt balance and the opportunity kind of diminishes to continue to paydown debt and reduce interest expense. There's going to be more opportunity to fulfill the require -- the remaining authorization that we have a $53 million on our $150 million authorization. So it's going to be balanced and we look to continue to generate that excess cash flow in order to continue to return that invested capital.\nDaniel Imbro: All right. Thanks so much and best of luck going forward.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thank you.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of John Healy of Northcoast Research. John, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Healy: Thanks guys for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the comments on -- hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the comments on reducing less productive labor. It sounds like a tricky thing to do, whether it's the location or maybe the tenure or the talent, and especially with the shortages of mechanics out there. So we'd just love to get your big picture thoughts on how you're evaluating that and what you're doing there, and are we interpreting it the right way thinking that the labor is at the store level?\nMichael Broderick: Yeah. No, you're interpreting it the right way. We're very focused on the store level payroll. We've spent over the last two and a half plus years staffing up our stores, so we can get ready for the -- what we believe is the tailwinds of the industry. We're very focused on training our technicians, very focused on making sure we retain them and we keep them qualified to do the work that comes through our shops. What I focused a lot of my -- and the team's focused on is really mitigating wage and the wage expansion and why we're so focused on talking about overtime every quarter because that's the number one way that we're controlling payroll, unproductive payroll, making sure the stores are staffed and mitigating the wages through overtime. We definitely are focused on making sure our stores continue to be staffed with quality technicians. That's not going to change -- when I talk about unproductive payroll, it's mostly about overtime.\nJohn Healy: Got it. That makes perfect sense. And then just kind of industry type question. One of the things that surprised me recently was some of the Michelin commentary that US replacement shipments into the US were up like low double-digits in September. Just kind of your reaction to that, is that a sign that the industry is restocking or maybe a sign that you're starting to get some relief on pricing. So maybe folks are taken in product or you just thought it was odd number. Just kind of curious kind of your thoughts on that.\nMichael Broderick: Yeah. I don't have really anything that I have to support a comment about it. So I just look at making sure our vendors are shipping to us when we require it. We have an excellent relationship with ATD, so we have a lot of our inventory is just in time and we have a very supportive vendor community. When we're down one through six -- down 6% in tier one through three, that affects obviously our large manufacturers and they're investing in us to drive traffic. So the good news is we have great relationships with our vendor partners. We'll continue relying on that vendor partnership relationship, and we do expect the customer to come back and they'll be beneficiaries of it just like us.\nJohn Healy: Great. Thanks guys.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thanks.\nOperator: Now we have no further questions in the queue today. So I'd like to hand back to Monro CEO, Michael Broderick, for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nMichael Broderick: Thank you for joining us today. This continues to be an exciting time to be part of Monro. We have a strong foundation to build upon to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Monro Inc.’s Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2024. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without permission from the company. I’d now like to introduce Felix Veksler, Senior Director of Investor Relations at Monro. Please go ahead.\nFelix Veksler: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning’s call. Before we get started, please note that as part of this call, we will be referencing a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at corporate.monro.com/investors. If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2, I’d like to remind participants that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Monro’s future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monro’s filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Additionally, on today’s call, management’s statements include a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable GAAP measures will be included as part of today’s presentation and in our earnings release. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Monro’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Broderick.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, Felix. And good morning, everyone. I would like to start off by acknowledging that our first quarter results fell short of the expectations that we set on our last earnings call in May. I’ll spend the first part of our call this morning, walking through the shortfall, which was primarily driven by lower-than-expected sales due to customer deferrals and our higher-margin service categories in June. Broad-based inflationary pressures have persisted such that the consumers slowed their purchases of some of our higher ticket service categories. As a result of this, we took swift action to reduce nonproductive labor costs, including overtime hours in our stores, which allowed us to preserve margins and profitability on lower-than-expected sales. I will conclude with our plans to deliver improved earnings this fiscal year despite some of the consumer-related headwinds that we and others in our industry are experiencing. Before I get started, I’d like to recognize and thank all of our teammates serving as trusted vehicle advisers in what continues to be a challenging macro environment for our customers. Now turning to our first quarter results and the actions that we took to reduce nonproductive labor costs. Our first quarter comparable store sales growth of less than 1% fell short of our expectations. As I stated earlier, the shortfall was primarily driven by lower-than-expected sales due to customer deferrals in some of our key service categories in June. This also resulted in store comps for our 300 small underperforming stores that were consistent with our overall comps in the quarter. While our comps in the quarter fell short of expectations, customer traffic counts were in line with our expectations and remains consistent with improving traffic trends in the back half of fiscal 2023. And while our tire margins returned to solid footing, our overall gross margin in the quarter was impacted by a lower sales mix of higher-margin service categories. This resulted in higher material costs and continued labor cost pressures as a percentage of sales relative to our expectations. We took swift actions to reduce non-productive labor costs, including overtime hours in our stores, which were down 23% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. This allowed us to preserve margins and profitability on lower-than-expected sales. We will continue to closely manage our labor costs and expense to maximize store productivity. Now concluding with our plans to deliver improved earnings this fiscal year. While we will likely need to see an improvement in the overall health of the consumer before we can fully capitalize on longer-term industry tailwinds, we will remain relentlessly focused on achieving our mid-single-digit comp store sales expectations through accelerating growth in our 300 small or underperforming stores, maintaining a balanced approach between our tire and service categories with competitive pricing to drive store traffic and continuously improving our customer experience. Encouragingly, our preliminary comp store sales growth for fiscal July are up approximately 1%, which is a positive rebound of the sales trends that we saw in fiscal June and a step in the right direction. We will also strive to expand our gross margins through appropriate staffing in our stores and properly training our teammates to maximize their productivity. However, given the current pressures on the consumer, we are also laser-focused on maximizing profitability through prudent cost control, which includes rightsizing our fixed costs and rationalizing unproductive labor. While we take these actions, we will not cut productive labor at the sacrifice of our standards and to the detriment of our long-term service model. In addition, we will continue to create cash by optimizing inventory and leveraging the strength of our vendor partners for better availability, quality and cost of parts and tires in our stores. In closing, our business is well positioned, and we are confident that we remain on a path to restore our gross margins back to pre-COVID levels with double-digit operating margins over the longer term. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide an overview of Monro’s first quarter performance, strong financial position and additional color regarding fiscal 2024. Brian?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, sales decreased 6.5% year-over-year to $327 million in the first quarter, which was due to the divestiture of our wholesale tire and distribution assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales for these divested assets were approximately $24 million in the prior year first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 0.5%, and sales from new stores increased approximately $2 million. Gross margin was flat compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from 220 basis points of benefit from both the divestiture of our wholesale tire and distribution assets as well as lower distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, which were offset by higher material costs and higher technician labor costs due to an incremental investment in technician headcount as well as wage inflation. Total operating expenses were $97 million or 29.7% of sales as compared to $95.9 million or 27.4% of sales in the prior year period. The increase as a percentage of sales was principally due to the sales decline resulting from the divestiture of our wholesale tire and distribution assets, costs related to shareholder matters from our planned equity capital structure recapitalization, as well as transition costs related to our back office optimization in the current year, and a net gain on the sale of our wholesale tire and distribution assets in the prior year period. Operating income for the first quarter declined to $17.4 million or 5.3% of sales. This is compared to $26.3 million or 7.5% of sales in the prior year period. Net interest expense decreased to $5.2 million, as compared to $5.7 million in the same period last year. This was principally due to a decrease in weighted average debt. Income tax expense was approximately $3.4 million or an effective tax rate of 27.6%, which is compared to $8.1 million or an effective tax rate of 39.6% in the prior year period. The higher effective tax rate in the prior year period was primarily due to discrete tax impacts related to the divestiture of our wholesale tire locations and tire distribution operations, as well as the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in the mix of pretax income in various U.S. state jurisdictions because of the divestiture. Net income was approximately $8.8 million as compared to $12.5 million in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.28 compared to $0.37 for the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.31. This is compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.42 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Please refer to our reconciliation of adjusted diluted EPS in this morning’s earnings press release and on Slide 8 in our earnings presentation for further details regarding excluded items in the first quarter of both fiscal years. As highlighted on Slide 9, we continue to maintain a very solid financial position. We generated $72 million of cash from operations during the first quarter, including $52 million in working capital reductions. This has reduced our cash conversion cycle by approximately 71 days at the end of the first quarter compared to the prior year period. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the first quarter was 195% versus 178% at the end of fiscal 2023. We received $4 million in divestiture proceeds, we invested $8 million in capital expenditures, spent $10 million in principal payments for financing leases and distributed $9 million in dividends. Lastly, given the higher interest rate environment, we opted to pay down some of our debt in the first quarter to reduce interest expense versus repurchasing shares under our program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to $150 million of the company’s common stock. We have used our significant cash flow to reduce invested capital by $53 million during the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we had bank debt of $65 million, cash and cash equivalents of $15 million and a net bank debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3 times. While we are not providing full year guidance, we are providing color to assist in your modeling. We expect to drive higher year-over-year sales through low to mid-single-digit comparable store sales growth and outsized performance in our 300 small or underperforming stores, which is inclusive of an extra week of sales in our fiscal fourth quarter. We expect to drive year-over-year improvements in our gross margin through pricing actions, lower fixed distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to a higher sales base and productivity improvements from our labor investments and reduction of nonproductive payroll, which will be partially offset by continued wage inflation. Total operating expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be higher year-over-year due to increases in direct and departmental costs to support our store base, as well as the impact of inflation. Our tax rate should be approximately 26% for fiscal 2024. Regarding our capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $35 million to $45 million in fiscal 2024. We also expect to continue improving our operating cash flow, driven by continued working capital reductions. Our balanced approach of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as well as opportunistically completing value-enhancing acquisitions is expected to meaningfully increase our return on invested capital. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Mike for some closing remarks.\nMichael Broderick: Thanks, Brian. We’re optimistic about our outlook for fiscal 2024 and beyond. Although we still have important work to do, we remain well positioned to execute our growth strategy and deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator:\nQ - Brian Nagel: Hey guys. Good morning.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Good morning.\nMichael Broderick: Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Nagel: So the first question I have; I’m just looking, we’re just running through the numbers here and looking at the monthly comps. And as you discussed in your script, I mean, June did slow down but I mean not just on a one-year basis, but really over even a multi-year stack. As you look at what caused that? I mean I know you had mentioned you have the inflationary pressures, but it seemed like something just given the trajectory of the business, something even more specific to June may have occurred?\nMichael Broderick: Yes. Brian, this is Mike. I’ll take that. What we saw was across the board, industry-wide, significant slowdown in tire, tire units. Just the overall compression on tires, and I would look at tires as a high-ticket item, and then I moved right into some of my service categories in the high-ticket service categories. What we did see was actually a decent balance of our customer transactions, so our invoice count was okay. It was just low-ticket invoices, all driven by the lack of, I would say a healthy tire unit. And what we see, Brian, it was pretty much in our footprint. It was pretty much across the board on the tire category – in the tire category.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. And I guess – and I know we talked about this a lot, Mike. It’s the ongoing kind of repositioning that you’ve spurred here at Monro. But as you look at the business now, in the release day you reiterate the kind of the longer-term guidance in that longer-term objective to get to consistent mid-single-digit comps. What leverage do you, I mean what – clearly there’s an unfavorable backdrop. We’ve discussed that, but what specific levers or are there incremental levers you can pull here to really to get the business up to where you want it to be?\nMichael Broderick: Yes. That’s a good question. Everything we’ve been doing is preparing ourselves to create a Monro that’s very nimble for the marketplace and the customer environment that we have – we’re dealing with. We divested and we’re now out of that divestiture. We’re full year passed so we don’t have to talk about that anymore. But all the work that the teams are doing are creating a better assortment for our teams to be able to sell, managing payroll to a point where we can manage payroll no matter what the circumstances are. As sales improve, we can really lever up. As sales decline, we can actually take payroll out. I’ll give you an example of the team and the work that they’ve done on over time. And that’s, I would say, is – has been pretty significant over the tenure that I’ve been here is really getting an emphasis on controlling payroll. As we invest in our people agenda, it’s going to be really important and especially in the wage inflation that we’re dealing with is managing every hour for every store so that we can maximize productivity with our technicians. I would say the biggest lever that we have to pull right now is really fixing our small stores. Although those stores were never supposed to be linear, it took years for these stores to be underperforming. My expectation is that we deliver double-digit comps in these stores. But when I look at these stores, most of them are low-volume stores. So when they have missed one or two transactions a week, and these were maybe tire transactions, which is a good ticket, it really has an adverse result – adverse impact on the comp. And Brian, I have to tell you, when I look at the low-volume stores, it took several years to get there, it’s going to take me some time in order for us to have consistent results. I think secondly, a lot of the work that the team is doing is really creating a different culture, a sales culture, making sure that we just have a better environment for our customers that are coming in. And with a little bit of help in the backdrop, I think that we’re well positioned to go after that mid-single-digit number.\nBrian Nagel: Appreciate the color. I’ll pass it on to next question. Thanks.\nMichael Broderick: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you, Dan. Good morning.\nDaniel Imbro: I want to follow up on Brian’s second question there on the underperforming stores. I think the outlook that Brian gave kind of implied low-to-mid-single-digit comps, but it was driven by a better improvement this year in those 300 stores. I’m just trying to marry that with the comment in the release about you need the consumer to turn before things really get better. So I guess; how much of that improved underperforming store maybe in your control? And then maybe more specifically like what are the things you’re changing right now to drive that improvement over the next six-ish months?\nMichael Broderick: Yes. So I would say the – in these stores a lot of it is the people focus on the people. So the people agenda that I started with from the very beginning coming on with the organization, I would say is the foundation for improving these underperforming stores. We’ve got to get the right team to create the right experience for our customers. Now what are we doing holistically to support that initiative? Obviously, we’re creating training. I’ve walked everybody through in the past, creating a better environment. We’re attracting better technicians so that we are able to do better work and we have better customer retention. Now overall, when I look at the category on the tire assortment, now that we’re a full-year outside of the divestiture of our wholesale business, we have a better tire assortment. We are able to manage our margins. In the past, I’ve talked about the fact that we sold a lot of OPP tires. I’m actually very happy with our entire performance looking at the market share data and how we’re holding our own, looking at the margin that we’re producing and looking at the mix of tires that we’re selling. It’s a very healthy mix of tires, and I feel like we’re meeting our customers with the right assortment. I’ve talked about breaks in the past. There’s a lot of work being done on our service categories. I still think we still have a lot of work in front of us that we’re executing in 2024 to be able to help us drive sales and margin. These are all things to help these stores, the underperforming stores as well as the rest of the chain. These underperforming stores, it just takes one or two transactions and their trajectory changes significantly in a week’s period of time. And we’re really managing that, type of conversation every week when I’m focusing on these focused stores.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. That’s helpful. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to maybe dig into the gross margin a little bit here. You’ve cut sequential over-time, I think you said 13%. That seems like a really nice growth there. I guess what percent of labor hours remaining would still fall into the – like non-productive classification? Or how much left is there to remove in terms of these non-productive hours until comps accelerate as you guys think about managing the cost base?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Yes. We’re – this is Brian, Daniel. We’re not going to go specifically into how much productivity or unproductive time is still there. What we do know is a huge focus of the organization to drive out any unproductive labor. We believe that we’re doing that through the actions that we’ve taken this past quarter, and we continue to do that. As Mike said in his prepared remarks, we are avoiding touching anything that we feel is truly supporting our top line growth. So that’s why we feel like we can still go after mid-single-digit comp store sales, while carefully managing out on productive labor, and those two things are competing with each other. At the same time, we’re obviously managing all other fixed costs as well outside of store direct labor including back office to really make sure that we’re being prudent about our cost structure against the top line backdrop.\nDaniel Imbro: And then I guess within the outlook, you kind of provided the framework; I think you said gross margins will be up year-over-year. Is that driven more by the sales improvement, which is part of that or more by further cost actions, like which of those levers is the bigger driver?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: I think it’s a mix of both. I think, first of all we’ve got some easier gross margin comps coming up ahead of us. So that’s the first thing. And then I think the second thing is that we expect to be able to drive that low- to mid-single-digit comp. As we do that we’ll get leverage against our fixed costs. But at the same time we’re rationalizing and looking like we said for pricing actions, anything we can do to improve variable flow through. So I think it’s a mix of both top line and other actions.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. I’ll follow-up offline. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We now turn to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBret Jordan: Hey good morning guys.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Good morning.\nMichael Broderick: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Did you talk about car counts in the quarter, I mean, to give us some sort of feeling for what a same SKU price contributed year-over-year versus traffic?\nMichael Broderick: I brought up the fact that our traffic was low-single-digits decline, low-single-digits. So when I look at our comp it was driven by very low improvement in ARO. And I actually feel like that’s maybe I can even give more color into that. That is part of what we’ve been focusing here on Monro is making sure that we have a healthy customer traffic trend. Even though we had a significant backdrop, even though when I look at the industry data and I look at our units and tires to actually have a very low-single-digit unit decline, invoice decline, I feel like we’re really waiting or we’re managing the business in an appropriate way. We just didn’t have the tire business that came in, Bret. We just didn’t have it.\nBret Jordan: Yes. Okay. And then you’ve called out in the sort of non-recurring expenses, the cost of the recap. Was there anything that was in the quarter that was sort of a pre-spend on the ultimate recap? Or was that – could you carve out what was that number?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Yes. No, I mean those are just – those are just fees and normal expenses associated with the recapitalization.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then could you give us the monthly comps?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Sure. We were up 2.4% in April, 0.7% in May and down 1.6% in June.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then any regional dispersion West Coast versus Northeast versus Southeast?\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Yes. We the Midwest and the West comped slightly above our consolidated comps. In the Northeast, obviously where we have a lot of stores was below. South was a little bit below as well.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nBrian D’Ambrosia: Welcome.\nMichael Broderick: Thanks Bret.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A. I’ll now hand back to Mike Broderick, President and CEO for closing remarks.\nMichael Broderick: Thank you for joining us today. This continues to be an exciting time to be part of Monro. We have a strong foundation to build upon to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen today’s call is now concluded. We’d like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."
