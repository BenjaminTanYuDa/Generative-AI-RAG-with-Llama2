I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJustin Furby: Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Aneel Bhusri, our Executive Chair; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our first quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins on April 15, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that Workday delivered a solid Q4, achieving 18% subscription revenue growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. These results were driven by momentum across the business and capped off a year of strong execution by our nearly 19,000 Workmates across the globe. Over the course of the last year, we've made key investments across our leadership team, go-to-market and partner ecosystem and our platform, positioning us to drive enduring growth in FY '25 and beyond. I couldn't be prouder of what we've accomplished over the last year, particularly in an environment where deal scrutiny remains high. I'd like to thank our customers, partners and especially my fellow Workmates for making these results possible. My belief in the opportunity ahead for Workday and our value proposition has only gotten stronger in the 14 months since I've joined. With the emergence of AI, shifting talent landscape and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, leaders are turning to Workday as their trusted platform to manage their most critical assets, their people and their money. Customers have come to trust us with helping them navigate these huge transformations from the cloud to AI. In fact, the theme of building trust took center stage at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos last month. Throughout my conversations, it was clear to me that leaders see the business benefits of implementing AI, but they also recognize building trust is key. Workday stands apart in our commitment to the responsible development of AI technologies, its responsible deployment within our own company and our advocacy for its regulation. We've been delivering AI capabilities to our customers for nearly a decade, building AI into the core of our platform, and we're making significant investments to further enhance our leadership in this area. Workday Skills Cloud, for example, uses AI to gain insights into an organization's current skills and identifies skills needed for the future, allowing for smarter decisions about talent across the company. In our upcoming R1 release, many of the generative AI use cases we showcased at Rising will be put into the hands of early adopters, including job descriptions and knowledge articles. To further accelerate our AI road map, today, we're excited to announce our planned acquisition of HiredScore, which provides AI-powered talent orchestration solutions. HiredScore's technology delivers data-driven insights to help improve recruiting and internal mobility processes. The combination of our data set in Workday Skills Cloud with HiredScore's solution will provide customers with a transparent, AI-powered talent acquisition and internal mobility offering. Not only is it technology compelling, but HiredScore and Workday share a commitment to responsible AI development, including a focus on explainability and transparency. We are absolutely thrilled about the potential of what we can do together. Now let's move into the performance from the quarter, which reflects the diversity and durability of Workday's business. As we shared at our Financial Analyst Day, our net new business is driven by a balanced mix of new customer wins and expansions within our installed base, which speaks to the significant opportunity that we have ahead. From a net new customer perspective, we once again saw strength in full platform deals. We welcomed customers like Australian Stock Exchange, Boyd Gaming Corporation, HHS, Randstad, UHS of Delaware and VXI Global Solutions as full platform HCM and Financials customers. And new HCM customers this quarter included Crane Company, El Corte Ingl√©s, Hitachi Astemo, Hungry Jack's, Kohler Co., and Swisscom. Alongside healthy net new customer activity, our customer base team again delivered in Q4. We had several strategic expansions and renewals in the quarter, including BJ's, Goodyear and Greystar Global Enterprise. And we had a number of core Financial Management expansions across our HCM customer base, including Allied Financial, Huntington Bank, Intermountain Health and Stewart Title Guaranty. Our create and close motion also had another great quarter and is becoming an important driver of our customer-based sales team's growth. From a solutions perspective, we saw healthy uptake across our portfolio, including Extend, where new ACV doubled year-over-year in Q4. We now have more than 850 Extend customers, and I'm pleased to share that roughly 1/3 of our Extend new ACV signed in Q4 was from our new professional SKU, which includes AI Gateway as well as Workday Developer Copilot launching later this year. Beyond the wins we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform and I'm pleased to share that in FY '24, over 95% of our deployments went live on time. In Q4, we had several strategic HCM deployments, including AT&T, Northern Trust and Whataburger, alongside notable Financial Management go-lives, including American University, Sagility Operations and UMass Memorial Health. To propel our land and expand business, we continue to invest in several growth areas. I'll share a few highlights from those areas now, starting with international. Today, international represents over half of our addressable opportunity yet is 1/4 of our revenues. We're working to change that, and we're seeing early signs of progress. In EMEA, our leadership additions continue to drive improved and more consistent results. I spent a couple of weeks visiting our teams in Europe this past quarter, and I have to tell you, I am fired up by the momentum we're building. In Q4, our teams once again delivered healthy new ACV growth across key markets such as the U.K., Spain and France. We also closed our first deal in EMEA with our Alight co-sell partnership, and we continue to build pipeline with important partnerships alongside ADP and Alight in addition to our broader referral and co-sell ecosystem. In the Asia Pacific region, Australia delivered once again, and I'm pleased to share that Japan, which is a key investment priority, drove strong new ACV growth in Q4. While it's still early days for us in this market, we're focused on growing it. To help lead the way, I'm delighted to welcome Chikara Furuichi as our new leader of the Japanese market to help us win in one of the world's largest economies. Chikara brings over 25 years of experience in both SaaS security and cloud services from across Japan and APAC. He reports directly to Patrick Blair, our President of Global Sales. Moving to financials. We're seeing continued proof that our go-to-market and platform investments are paying off with healthy growth in core financials customers and new ACV and a robust pipeline looking forward. We drove a record number of new full platform wins in both Q4 and FY '24, and our industry approach is a clear driver of this momentum. Health care, for example, again grew new ACV over 50% in Q4, capping off a fantastic FY '24. Our innovation in key areas such as supply chain is differentiating us in the market and is driving industry awards such as the recent recognition in best-of-class in enterprise resource planning for the seventh year in a row. We're also pleased to share that Gartner named Workday a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Financial Planning Software for the second time since the category's inception last year. Our education and government teams also drove continued success in FY '24, and higher ed was a standout in Q4 with a number of full platform wins, including Oregon State University, Portland Community College and the College of William and Mary. And to help accelerate our trajectory in the U.S. Federal business, I'm delighted to welcome Lynn Martin as our new federal leader. Lynn has more than 30 years' experience in the public sector, most recently running Google's U.S. federal business and before that, running VMware's public sector team for close to a decade. Supporting our progress around many of these investment areas is our partner ecosystem where our focus is delivering customer outcomes, growing our business through referrals and co-selling and building differentiated solutions. During Q4, we announced a strategic partnership with Insperity that delivers on all 3 of these priorities. Through this partnership, Workday will become the platform powering Insperity's PEO service for SMB organizations, effectively opening up a new market opportunity for us. It's a terrific example of how we're innovating our go-to-market strategy to drive growth. Another great example is the Spark&Grow offering, which we launched with Kainos. It helps our emerging and medium enterprise customers to go live on Workday in less than 4 weeks. We've seen incredible demand for this offering, and we're just getting started. These are 2 great examples of momentum that is building across our ecosystem, which I'm pleased to share now includes more than 200 partners that have been onboarded to refer new sales leads and co-sell with us. We launched this pilot program last May and we've seen momentum building throughout the year with a nice uptick in Q4 partner-driven pipeline generation. In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's strong execution throughout FY '24, all while navigating a dynamic environment and embracing important changes we've rolled out across the business. We enter FY '25 with a strong foundation and a clear strategy to support durable growth while at the same time continuing to drive efficiencies across the business. As I said on my first Workday earnings call 1 year ago, we have the opportunity to be one of the largest, most enduring and profitable software businesses of our time. I've never been more convinced in that belief. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Aneel, who recently moved into a new role as Executive Chair. Aneel, it has been an incredible 14 months, and I'm truly grateful for your partnership and the trust you put in me to lead what you and Dave started nearly 19 years ago. Your technology vision and your commitment to Workday's special culture and values have put this company in an incredible position. I am excited for what we'll achieve together next. Thank you for continuing to be in my corner not just in guiding the applications and platform development but also as a friend. Aneel, over to you.\nAneel Bhusri: Thank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call. As Carl highlighted, we are continuing to see solid momentum across the business, fueled in large part by our ability to deliver the innovation our customers need to thrive in today's fast-paced and dynamic environment. There is no doubt that more and more organizations, spanning midsize to large enterprises, are seeing the increasing value in building their businesses upon the Workday platform with AI at its core. Earlier this month, we officially named Carl sole CEO of Workday while I assumed the role of Executive Chair. As I've said before, there is no better person than Carl to lead Workday through this next chapter of growth. He has already made a tremendous impact on the business from day 1. And thanks to his leadership, we are already successfully executing on several key growth initiatives and strategies that he put in place. Furthermore, and most importantly, Carl perfectly aligns with our values-driven approach, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us with him at the helm. As Executive Chair, I'll remain actively involved but with an emphasis on my true passion as a technologist. Together with our Co-President, Sayan Chakraborty, and the rest of our amazing product and technology organization, I will focus on guiding the future direction of Workday's applications and technology platform while staying close to our Workmates and our customers. How we evolve and expand the Workday platform in the coming years will be critical to our continued growth and scale. To help us do that, we have identified several core elements of our innovation strategy that we plan on building out over the next 12 to 18 months. The first is a continued focus on evolving our Financial Management and HCM applications so that we can further empower the offices of finance and HR to optimize their 2 most important assets, their people and their money. Next is AI. Fueled by our 10-year head start and unique approach to building AI directly into the core, we will continue to responsibly deliver new ML models that solve real business problems for our customers and enable their employees. We'll also incorporate high-value generative AI capabilities to enhance search, understand historical context, make recommendations and create content. Additionally, I'm incredibly excited about bringing HiredScore into the fold and how we'll further strengthen our overall AI capabilities. Third is industry, with an emphasis on deepening our offerings in retail and hospitality, education and government along with financial services, health care, professional services and tech and media. Extensibility is another important focus area so that we can enable IT teams to build and maintain integrations between Workday and third-party systems, ultimately extending the value of our platform. Our new Extend AI Gateway, which we announced at Rising last year, is a perfect example of the type of work we are focused on here. Fifth is experiences. Delivering persona-tailored experiences empowers high-performing employees and teams for maximum productivity. Manager Insights Hub and Flex Teams, which we also unveiled at Rising, are just a few of the ways we've already been delivering enhanced experiences for managers. The final area of investment is security and resiliency, which is foundational to everything we do. With more than 10,000 organizations depending on Workday to help run their businesses, it's essential that we design to protect the resilience and performance of critical processes, safeguard against the growing number of global cybersecurity threats and increase our investment in public cloud offerings to drive greater performance, scalability and security for our customers. We're also investing in our long-term innovation strategy by continuing to strengthen our product and technology leadership team. I'm pleased to share that David Somers has been appointed as our new Chief Product Officer and will lead development across our full suite of products. David, who will continue to report into Sayan, has been instrumental in leading our HR product strategy and development in the last few years, and I'm excited that he will be helping to lead our efforts to build out the capabilities of Workday's full product portfolio. As I think back to our early days, it's incredible to see the growth and scale we've been able to achieve. When our customers first went live in 2007, we offered a few different products. Today, we offer a full platform that helps our customers transform how they manage their people and their money. Additionally, we now have more than 5,400 core HCM and Finance customers, more than 65 million users under contract and process over 800 billion transactions per year. I'm proud of the company we've built and the continued value and impact that we deliver for our customers. In closing, I want to extend my deepest thanks to our nearly 19,000 Workmates around the world for finishing our fiscal year 2024 in such a strong fashion. Workday's future is incredibly bright, and I'm energized to work alongside them, Carl and the rest of our leadership team to help drive Workday forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Zane. Over to you, Zane.\nZane Rowe: Thanks, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As Carl and Aneel mentioned, Q4 marked a solid close to FY '24 with momentum building across our key investment initiatives. We enter FY '25 well positioned to deliver another year of durable subscription revenue growth, coupled with expanding margins. Turning to results. Subscription revenue in Q4 was $1.76 billion, up 18%, and full year FY '24 subscription revenue was $6.6 billion, growing 19%. Professional services revenue was $162 million in the quarter and $656 million for the year. Total revenue in Q4 was $1.92 billion and for the full year was $7.26 billion, both growing 17%. U.S. revenue in Q4 totaled $1.44 billion, up 16%, and international revenue totaled $478 million, growth of 21%. For the year, U.S. revenue was $5.46 billion and international revenue was $1.8 billion, both growing 17%. As we have highlighted, we see significant long-term international market opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful driver of our growth. 12-month subscription revenue backlog or CRPO was $6.62 billion at the end of Q4, representing growth of 20% with the outperformance driven by higher-than-anticipated early renewals. Gross and net revenue retention rates remain over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $20.92 billion, up 27%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $461 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $1.74 billion, reflecting a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. Q4 GAAP net income benefited from a onetime $1.1 billion valuation allowance release related to our U.S. deferred tax assets. Q4 operating cash flow was $996 million, with approximately $100 million of the outperformance driven by strong in-quarter collections and earlier-than-expected payments. Full year operating cash flow was $2.15 billion, growth of 30%. During Q4, we repurchased $136 million of our shares at an average price of $253.85 per share. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to invest in growth areas of the business, and we ended January with over 18,800 Workmates around the globe. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance of $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%, which aligns with the preliminary outlook we provided last quarter. This guidance reflects our Q4 performance and our expectation for current macro conditions to persist throughout FY '25. We expect Q1 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.81 billion, representing 18% growth. I will highlight that Q1 benefits from an extra day of revenue recognition, given the leap year. Normalized for this, our guided subscription revenue growth in Q1 is approximately 17%. For Q2, we expect subscription revenue to increase approximately 5% sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality in the business when considering the leap year impact of Q1. We anticipate FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $630 million to $640 million as we further leverage our partner ecosystem. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $163 million. Turning to backlog. As we've highlighted, CRPO growth is influenced by quarter-to-quarter variability in renewal volume, which can impact its growth in any particular quarter. In FY '25, we expect CRPO growth to come off the elevated levels we experienced in FY '24 as we lap periods of strong scheduled and early renewals. Given this variability, we expect CRPO to increase between 17.5% and 18.5% in Q1. We expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 24.5%. Our outlook contemplates incremental investments across our key growth initiatives while delivering continued margin expansion as we scale and optimize the business. For Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%. GAAP operating margins for the first quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 24 and 21 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate is 19%. We expect FY '25 operating cash flow of $2.25 billion, which is impacted by the $100 million of Q4 collections I called out as well as an extra payroll payment we expect to make in FY '25, given the leap year. In addition, we expect FY '25 capital expenditures of approximately $330 million. Our FY '25 outlook takes into account the acquisition of HiredScore, which is expected to close later this quarter. We're pleased with our execution in FY '24, thanks to the support of our customers, partners and Workmates. With momentum building across our strategic growth areas, we enter FY '25 focused on continuing to invest to drive long-term growth while also expanding margins. Let me turn it back over to Aneel before we begin Q&A.\nAneel Bhusri: Thanks, Zane. Given my new role, this will be my last regularly scheduled earnings call as I fully hand over the reins to the great Carl and Zane. It's been a pleasure getting to know so many of you over the years, and I wanted to give a special thank you to Mark Murphy, Brent Thill, Pat Walravens, Kirk Materne and John DiFucci, who have all been covering Workday since our IPO in 2012, and also to Kash Rangan, who I'm sure wanted to cover us back then but couldn't because his wife was a Workmate at the time. Okay. With that, operator, let's go to the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan: I am almost fighting tears in my eyes, Aneel. I was glad to be a part of the family, and now I'm part of the extended family since my wife is no longer a Workmate, but we're still here with you guys. One question for Carl and team, maybe. You gave guidance for next year back in September at Rising. The economic environment, the outlook has generally gotten better, right, or seemingly out of the fear of a recession. And you've got a slew of new products, you've got an expanded partnership strategy. You've got a reseller partnership strategy as well. So with all these new dimensions, what is getting the growth rate of the company -- because the guidance is roughly the same as it was. I'm just trying to understand the level of conservatism vis-√†-vis the levers that you have today, macro and micro included, that are definitely putting the company in a better position.\nCarl Eschenbach: Kash, thanks for the question. Before I answer it, I just want to start by thanking our Workmates, partners and customers around the world for delivering a solid Q4 and an outstanding full FY '24 performance. I could not be prouder of our execution, especially given the uncertainties of the environment at the start of FY '24 and while embracing important changes we've put in place here at Workday. The value proposition of our Workday platform continues to grow, which is evident from our results. The durability and diversity of our business delivers consistent solid growth while also driving operating leverage. I am grateful to Aneel for this incredible partnership that we have, and we can't wait to see what we're going to do together with the rest of our Workmates this year. We are just getting started. Kash, to answer your question, as you know, we have really put in place a number of strategic growth initiatives starting last year, and all of them are taken into account when we think about our guidance for this full year. When you think about what we announced at the Financial Analyst Day, we announced a 3-year growth strategy that maintained pretty consistent growth over the next 3 years as we got larger and we continue to expand our operating margin. Then at the end of Q3, we delivered a preliminary guidance for FY '25, which we reiterated here on this call today. Our growth initiatives are paying off. We have really solid growth. We continue to expand margins, and we will continue to lean into those growth initiatives as we think about the rest of this year. So we're pretty proud that we're maintaining the growth rate we have and still expanding margins, and it's because of those strategic initiatives that you mentioned that we are leaning into.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: First off, Aneel, I wanted to thank you for everything over so many years and that -- to let you know that I'm incredibly grateful. Carl, I wanted to ask you, it feels -- you and/or Aneel, I should say. It feels like Workday has been quietly gaining a reputation as a lighthouse for AI, and you're focusing on the safe handling of all this data and not overcharging. As you introduce these products in the upcoming release that you mentioned, what type of productivity boosts are you expecting to achieve for an HR practitioner? And I'm just wondering, is it strongest in the talent areas of skills and hiring, which I think you're mentioning more? Or do you think it's going to be more broadly applicable in other areas like budgeting and supply chain and so on and so forth?\nAneel Bhusri: Maybe I'll just take the high level and I'll turn it over to Carl. AI is going to be important across all those applications. But the first area that we've seen quite a bit of interest and traction has been on the talent management side, both through our Talent Optimization and Skills Cloud products and now through the acquisition of HiredScore. It's a natural area for AI to showcase. But as you think about an area like budgeting, hugely powered to think about effectively a Copilot driving smarter and smarter plans automatically for you and being able to replan on an almost instantaneous basis. And the world is so dynamic right now, it's really what you need. So in terms of productivity, I'll let Carl talk about it.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Thanks, Aneel. Yes, Mark, I do think the first place we're seeing true productivity gains is around what I would just describe as talent acquisition. And when you think about the addition of HiredScore, that we just acquired, along with our recruiting platform, our Talent Optimization platform and our candidate engagement platform, it gives us the ability to deliver a full suite for talent acquisition around how we identify talent, how we engage with them, how we source or recruit them and then how we retain them for internal mobility. So I am really confident in our ability to deliver a strong ROI to the recruiting and talent organizations, with us having what I think now is one of the best full platform suites for talent acquisition going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Aneel, congratulations on the new responsibilities and great job on building a great company. My question is for Zane actually, and it's, I think, more about sort of guidance. This quarter, subscription revenues was about $5 million ahead of your guidance. I think this is probably the smallest beat that we've ever seen from Workday in terms of subscription revenues. It seems like there's a lot of dynamics going on with early renewals and like how that impacts CRPO. Was there any impact on subscription revenues? Or anything that can help us understand sort of the skinnier-than-typical beat in terms of subscription revenues that we saw in the current quarter?\nZane Rowe: Sure, Keith. Yes, I mean, subscription revenues came in obviously ahead of our guide and as you point out, still ahead of where the Street was. I'll point out, fourth quarter is a big quarter for us and we had a really busy January. So some of that may have been reflected in the quarter as far as if you think about just linearity throughout the quarter. So there was some impact into the quarter. But as we look to FY '25 and we think about the buildup heading into FY '25, as you pointed out, we've seen good CRPO growth through all of last year. And as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we don't necessarily anticipate that level of growth above the subscription revenue growth that we've seen just because of the renewal activity on both the scheduled side as well as the early renewal activity. So there's some of that built into the guide. There's nothing that I would point out in the fourth quarter other than it was a solid fourth quarter. We feel really good about the momentum we have in the business. We feel good about the outlook. As Carl pointed out, it's consistent with the outlook and the guide that we gave a quarter ago. So we feel great about where we're sitting right now. I will also point out the aggregate level of CRPO. If you look at that versus the upcoming guide for the year, we're actually at a slightly higher level than where we were for the same time of the prior year, so the same time last year. So again, we feel like we're very well positioned heading into the year. It was a good fourth quarter and we're all ready to execute into FY '25.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.\nKirk Materne: And Aneel, I'll echo my thanks and best wishes on your new role. I think my question is for Carl. Carl, obviously, platform deals this year seem to have been a pretty big lever for you all, especially in the mid-market. Can you just talk about your confidence level in the pipeline around platform deals as we go into fiscal '25 and just sort of what that looks like?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Kirk. As we've said for the last year, we are focusing on delivering a full platform solution to our customers, both HCM and Financials, and we have seen a nice uptick in our selling motion there. In the medium enterprise, we're seeing a big uptick, so our full platform sales are going up, but we're also seeing it in the upmarket as well in large enterprise. And then there are certain industries where we see it like state and local government. We see it in health care. Our health care business had a really big quarter, a 50% growth year-over-year. So it is definitely a selling motion we're leaning into. And I think, quite frankly, we're just getting started. Our Financials platform continues to gain momentum in the market. We're able to sell FINS back into our existing HCM customers, so they become full platform customers. And net new sales, a lot of them are full platform from day 1. So the full platform approach we're taking is clearly paying dividends and driving our growth. We will also be -- starting next week, we'll be transitioning. In the past, we've talked about some pricing and packaging where we'll be selling more suites and bundles. That's something we'll be educating our field on next week. It's been in pilot. It's -- the pilot has gone well. And we're quite hopeful about how we're going to change pricing and packaging to encourage customers to have an easier way to buy a full platform from Workday.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Aneel, I'm glad you had that meal at the Truckee Diner. I'm sure you're thankful for that. Thanks again for everything. Carl, I think just back to Keith's question, when we see 22% backlog in Q3 going to 20% in Q4 and down to 18% in Q1 on the guide, I think everyone appreciates the steps and initiatives you're taking, but the growth numbers are kind of working in the wrong direction relative to the initiatives that you're taking. And I realize that perhaps this takes some time to play out, but I think everyone is trying to understand the environment is getting better, yet the backlog numbers seem to be declining quarter-over-quarter and then in Q1. So I'm just curious if you can help bridge what's going on.\nZane Rowe: Brent, yes, I'll start. This is Zane. We are very pleased with the backlog build. And as we pointed out, we focused primarily on subscription revenue build, and backlog is influenced by not only scheduled renewals but also this early renewal activity, which we now lap. If you recall, we started talking about that a year ago. So again, the 20% backlog growth that we saw this quarter actually came in, if you recall, about 1 point higher than even our expectations. And a big contributor of that was the pull-in that we saw through this early renewal activity. And we would expect backlog to have some variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis as you think about how you build backlog and how it's aligned with not only new ACV growth but the scheduled renewal growth. So it's coming in, I'd say, very close to our expectation. As we point out and as I mentioned over the last number of calls, we don't expect to see, in particular with CRPO, the sustained growth level coming in higher than subscription revenue growth in perpetuity. And we feel really good about the aggregate. If you look at the aggregate CRPO level as a percent of the guide, you can see it's actually at a higher level than what it was last year. So we feel really good about the build. But as I caution, there will be some variability as we expect on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Also, Zane, I just wanted to touch on the renewals dynamic. It's a conversation we've had now, I guess, for our fifth earnings call in a row here. But it is, again -- early renewals is an output of customer demand. And when customers want to buy product from us and consolidate onto our best-of-breed platform as opposed to having all these -- or best-of-suite platform versus all these best-of-breed solutions, it drives early renewals. So our teams don't get paid on early renewals. It's basically customer demand and early renewals is an output, right? It's not something we go out and focus on. So we're very pleased with the demand we see from customers, both net new and our customer base and selling back into them, which does drive early renewals. But that can vary, Zane, as you know, right, in any given quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBradley Sills: Congratulations, Aneel, on your new role here. I wanted to ask one on the verticals here. It's a big focus. You've been talking about this for a couple of years now. I know government, higher ed, health care, those have been relatively strong for quite some time. Can you give us a sense for which one in the other list, retail, hospitality, financials, tech and media where you see some of the fruits of the efforts that you've been making here to build on the product and go-to-market where we could see some incremental strength in any of those verticals?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Maybe I'll start, Doug, and then you can add, if you don't mind. I think the industry strategy or the vertical strategy we have here at Workday plays nicely with, if you will, our segment strategy. That's why we talk a lot about the diversity of our business. But to your point, health care continues to be a very large segment for us. We talked about retail and hospitality last quarter was the second, if you will, vertical that crossed $1 billion in ARR. We talked about the continued momentum around higher ed and full platform sales there. And then also around financial services, we didn't call it out and specifically in the earnings call as a vertical, but we had a number of very significant financial sales back into existing HCM customers around financial services. So that was a great indicator that full platform is resonating around financial services as well. So our industry strategy is playing out, and we saw another really strong quarter across those key markets. Doug, I don't know, maybe you have some additional color you'd like to add.\nDouglas Robinson: Sure. So in addition to the usual suspects of sort of those top industries that you excluded from the question, 2 that stand out. Professional services, I think we even highlighted the Randstad win. But we're seeing industries like professional services or business services where you bring people and money together are the perfect sort of scenario for a full platform opportunity for Workday. So we saw really good performance there in Q4. And then the second, which doesn't really sort of capture maybe the attention it deserves at times, which is medium enterprise platform deals, cuts across all of the industries you mentioned and includes the ones that, again, are the health care, FSI, public sector that you know well from us. So those are the 2 that I'd call out, Carl.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin: I wanted to maybe ask just the [indiscernible]. First, maybe in terms of the quarter itself, the fourth quarter, if you kind of dissect the large enterprise traction and activity versus kind of your traction activity in the mid-market, how would you say this fourth quarter trended versus previous? And then maybe, Zane, on the guide, is there any way to dimensionalize how much hired source -- or HiredScore, sorry, revenue you're including for the full year, just given you're reiterating a prior guide now with some acquired revenue?\nZane Rowe: Sure. Yes, I'll start on the inclusion. It's considered part of the prior guide. It's not a meaningful part of the total revenue guide, and we obviously include it in our cost base as well. So not meaningful when you think about the guide for this year but obviously very strategic for us, and we're very excited about what it will contribute beyond FY '25.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. And on the LE versus the medium enterprise, I'll let Doug start and then I'll add some color.\nDouglas Robinson: Yes. So I'd say that Q4 was very similar to Q3 in terms of ME, LE both hitting really solid growth rates. And I'd draw the distinction between Q3 and Q4 where ME really snapped back. The first half of the year, I think we had even called this out in previous earnings calls, we saw certain industries within medium enterprise have some softness. But in Q3, and this held true in Q4 as well, medium enterprise, particularly medium enterprise net new, snapped back, so we saw really good growth dynamics in both ME and LE for Q4.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. And on the LE side, Doug, as we said in my prepared remarks and just we answered in the prior question, we had a really strong quarter again in health care, a good state and local government as well and then higher ed. They're 3 strong categories, right, that actually fall into our large enterprise business that once again had really strong performance in the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Maybe one for Zane on margin. You're up to 24% operating margin here, guiding for 24.5% as a starting point for next year, so within striking distance at the low end of that longer-term target range you framed out. I just would love to hear you spend some more time on how you're approaching the balance between growth and margin from here. And then on free cash flow, appreciate the Q4 commentary and the outperformance there. It looks like the initial fiscal '25 free cash flow outlook is relatively consistent with fiscal '24. So outside of that 4Q, kind of just anything else you can add on what might be the puts and takes on free cash flow is helpful.\nZane Rowe: Sure, Michael. Happy to talk a little bit about margin. I'd say it's consistent with the conversation we've had, candidly, through all of FY '24. But as we outlined at our Financial Analyst Day, Carl and the team have really taken, I think, a thoughtful approach across those investment buckets that we've highlighted to everyone, including our international expansion, the focus on FINS, on AI and leaning into partnerships, and obviously, as we've highlighted this quarter, also highlighting organic growth and M&A growth. And we've really balanced the investments that we're making and contemplated that with the outlook and the buildup for FY '21 -- sorry, FY '25, but also aligning for our longer-term outlook and continue to focus on not only investing in the right areas, but obviously, that driving long-term growth and contributing to a margin expansion over that period of time. So it's a balance that we continue to focus on. The team here are looking at each of those investment areas and categories and thinking about how to adjust those dynamically where we see opportunities around the globe, quite frankly, and leaning in where we can and at the same time, as you would expect, as we continue to focus on being more efficient as an organization and thinking about our global presence and focusing on those efficiencies so that we can not only scale the organization but reinvest in some of these key areas. And that's, I think, represented in the outlook that we have, both the top line growth and then the margin expansion coming in nicely aligned with the midterm outlook that we provided at Financial Analyst Day. And I would say operating cash flow and then free cash flow aligns with that. I highlighted the fact that in FY '24, we clearly benefited from some strong collections and early collections. We don't necessarily anticipate that reoccurring next year, and we factored that into the guide, into our OCF guide for FY '25. So we're pleased with the growth there. If you adjust for the $100 million as well as the extra pay period that just so happens to align because of the leap year, you get back to OCF growth that I believe is in line with the business growth. So we feel really good about the cash growth in the business and obviously feel very good about the top line growth and the margin expansion that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Maybe I'll direct this to Zane. And Zane, back on the CRPO, so a 2-parter. For the 20% CRPO growth that you put up for the January quarter, are you able to disclose what the early renewal impact was? I think 3 months ago, you had mentioned that it was a little bit more than 1 point. Curious what it was for January. And then when we look forward, just to clarify, is the guidance for 18% CRPO growth for April, have you now fully lapped this early renewal dynamic such that we should think about that being more of a normalized or clean compare? Or does this dynamic still represent a headwind that maybe in a couple of quarters you work through and you get a bit of a recovery in the year-over-year growth? I'd love to understand that without obviously asking for specific guidance.\nZane Rowe: Sure. Yes, of course, Karl. Yes, as you mentioned, in the fourth quarter, the 20% included about 1.5 points of early renewal activity, some of which we expected. But with the growth that we saw, obviously, just in ACV growth as well as that early renewal activity that came in ahead of our guide, I mentioned it came in, I believe, 1 point ahead of our guide. So we were very pleased with the CRPO growth in the quarter. But I'll also point out, we're still focused on subscription revenue. We are lapping a period of higher than traditional growth tied to these early renewals. And as I mentioned, I believe, at our Financial Analyst Day where I gave an example, at times, duration and the level of renewal activity, both scheduled and early, can have a fairly significant impact on that CRPO growth. So as we look at our scheduled renewals from FY '24 to FY '25, we actually continue to see nice growth, if you look at it on an annualized basis. But I'll point out, you do get some variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which is why we're now actually even including a range into our expectation heading into Q1. So you do -- you lap some of that early renewal activity that we've clearly benefited from, but we don't necessarily anticipate that growth that we've seen in at least the prior number of quarters to continue at that rate. And candidly, we're thrilled with the increase that we see in CRPO, but again, that's not the only driver to our forecasted subscription revenue growth, which is the key area that we focus on. So netting it out, we feel good about our CRPO aggregate levels, and we would expect to see some variability, which is included in our first quarter guide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\nJames Wood: Carl, you guys hired a lot of sales reps focused on selling core FINS over the last few quarters. Can you just give us a sense of how you're feeling about ramp to productivity times, how we should be thinking about kind of where we are in year-over-year growth and fully ramped sales capacity into the new year and just how you're thinking about sales hiring plans through fiscal '25?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Derrick. So you are right. Last year at this time, we announced we were doubling down our efforts on the go-to-market side around Financials, and that included hiring out a whole bunch of new sales reps, which we did, and that continued throughout Q4. And what we do is every quarter, we look at our key metrics on how we're performing against that investment. We look at the pipeline. We look at new logo wins. We said it was up pretty significantly here in Q4. We look at our competitive win rates, which continued to tick up throughout the year on Financials. We also take a look at new ACV, which we said was up year-over-year on Financials. And then the drag effect on all of that is full platform sales, which were also up in Q4 on a year-over-year basis. So we are pleased with the investments we've made on the go-to-market side around Financials, and we will continue to lean into that as these people become more and more productive. If you think about it, a lot of them have been on board only 6 or 9 or even 3 months, so we haven't seen the impact of the full investment at this time. It's also important to note that we're investing in Financials, not just directly in our own sales force but how we partner with our ecosystem. And also, we continue to invest in the product side of the business around Financials so that we have a much more global and localized platform around the world because we see that as a big opportunity as well. So net-net, we're very happy with the investment. We'll continue to lean in. We think it's a huge market opportunity. We've said many times, only 20% or 25% of workloads have moved to the cloud. And then if you combine that with our competition pushing customers to a new platform, it's a rich opportunity for us going forward.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: I get the noise here and renewal timing issues impacting CRPO. Wanted to double-click into subscription revenue growth. We've seen 6 quarters of slowing growth in the subscription business. You're actually guiding to growth to accelerate for the first time here into Q1. What is driving the optimism around this reacceleration of subscription growth? And maybe you could provide a little color around the pipeline visibility this year versus going into last year.\nZane Rowe: Sure. I'll start and then let Carl give a little more insight into the pipeline. I did point out that subscription revenue growth heading into Q1 does benefit from the additional day tied to the leap year. And as you would expect, heading into the next quarter, we have good visibility into the pipeline. We also have good visibility into the aggregate level of CRPO. So we feel good about what we've presented for not only the quarter but also the subscription revenue guide that we've given for the year, which aligns with our overall midterm outlook. So we believe that between the pipeline and the CRPO, we feel good about that revenue guide.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. And on us being cautiously optimistic on the year and why we provided the type of guidance we did for both Q1 and the full year FY '25, it's because the investments that we put in place last year are really coming to fruition for us, whether it's in the Financials platform that I just articulated. The partners are really starting to bring us new opportunities, and we're leveraging them for co-innovation. Our international focus, we talked about it over the last year and all the new talent we brought. We're seeing consistent and predictable results out of Europe, and we had a great quarter in APAC, and even Japan did a really nice performance for us. And then on AI, we think we got the most compelling AI platform in our market, and we continue to organically innovate there, and we're doing inorganic innovation like we did with HiredScore. So all of that gives us cautious optimism as we think about both Q1 and FY '25.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. I'll now turn it over to Mr. Eschenbach for final comments.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call, and a special thanks to our Workmates, customers, and partners around the globe that continue to fuel Workday's success. Q4 was another solid quarter, highlighted by the durable mission-critical nature of our business and reinforcing the exciting growth opportunity we have ahead. We are well positioned and focused on getting off to a good start here in FY '25. With that, I'll hand the call back over to the operator to close today's call. And I hope everyone has a great evening.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to one. I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Justin, you may begin.\nJustin Furby: Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri; and Carl Eschenbach our Co-CEOs; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also the customer's page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on January 15th, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you, Justin. And thank you, everyone for joining our Q3 FY 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to share that Workday delivered another strong quarter, achieving 18% subscription revenue growth, 22% 12 month backlog growth and non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. These results were driven by broad based strength across net-new and customer base teams, medium and large enterprise and across regions, notably, the U.S. and EMEA. I want to thank the more than 18,300 workmates around the globe for partnering with our customers to help drive these impressive results. There is a clear sense of momentum across our business and it was on full display at Workday Rising in September, there we unleased new AI innovation, delivered product and partnership announcements and drew a record 28,000 attendees in-person and online. In fact, over half of our active pipeline was touched by our rising event in San Francisco. And just a couple of weeks ago in Barcelona, we followed up with our largest ever EMEA rising event with over 4500 people in attendance. When speaking with customers, prospects and partners at these events, a few things stood out to me. First talent continues to be a top C-Suite priority. In this macro-environment businesses are looking to scale and drive productivity. They can achieve both outcomes by simply hiring more. Leaders are turning to Workday to help them reskill and upskill their workforce, all while delivering a great employee experience that helps them reduce attrition and ultimately drives productivity. Second leaders are continuing to consolidate their technology footprint on a true platform to realize total cost of ownership benefits, while also accelerating their operations. Workday is perfectly positioned to benefit as the intelligent digital backbone businesses can rely on to manage their most precious assets, their people, and their money. And finally, AI, and in particular, generative AI is becoming a business imperative. As a trusted partner and a market leader with over 65 million users under contract we can uniquely drive efficiencies and improve the employee experience. Aneel will share more, but. I will say, that it is what we are doing and not just saying that is resonating with our customers. Simply put, our value proposition has never been so relevant and powerful. That's clear, in the results our team delivered in Q3 and in the first half of FY 2024. At our recent financial Analyst Day, we talked about the diversity and durability of our business and how it helps us grow during times of headwinds and times of tailwinds. This theme was evident in the wins we had this quarter. From a net-new customer perspective, we once again saw strength in full platform deals. We welcome customers like AdventHealth, Bentley Systems, Houston Methodist and Lifespan as new full platform HCM and financials customers. And new HCM customers such as Greene King Brewing, Group 1 Automotive, Minor Hotel Group and the U.S. Department of Energy helped us surpass 5,000 core HCM customers on Workday. Alongside healthy new customer activity, we had several strategic expansions and renewals in the quarter, including Magna International, Mondelez Global, Sonoco Products Company and Southwest Airlines. And I'm pleased to share that our create and close business had another great quarter and it's becoming a meaningful driver of our customer base sales teams growth. Now, I want to highlight some of the key growth areas we discussed with you at our Financial Analyst Day. Starting with international, which represents over half our addressable opportunity. In EMEA, I'm pleased to say that our leadership additions are driving improved and more consistent results. The team here once again delivered strong new ACV, particularly in the UK, Germany, France and Spain and helped us eclipse the $1 billion ARR mark in the region. Win rates were robust against our competitors, even in their own backyards. We had important new wins like AXA UK, Aurelius Group and International schools along with expansions at BBVA, Carl Zeiss and TELUS Global Services among others. And in the Asia Pacific region, Australia performed well with wins such as Ramsay Health Care and Wesley mission Queensland. We still have work to do in APAC. But we're focused on it and I'm delighted, Simon Tate has joined us to run the region. We're also making important investments in Japan to help expand our opportunity within one of the world's largest economies. As part of this, our leader in Japan will now report directly to Patrick Blair, our President of Global Sales. Moving to financials. We are seeing proof that our go-to-market investments are continuing to pay-off with healthy growth in both core financial customers and new ACV. New full platform wins are on the rise and our industry approach is contributing to this momentum. Healthcare, for example, through new ACV over 50% in Q3 and roughly half of the healthcare deals we landed in the quarter were full platform. State and local government also continues to outperform with strategic full platform wins at of County of Kern, County of Chesterfield and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Our back to base motion in financials also delivered in Q3. Wins included Clearwater analytics, Ochsner Clinic Foundation and Concentrix, which expanded their Workday HR footprint to include core financials when it combined with Webhelp, a Workday core financials customer in EMEA. Our planning business also had a strong Q3 and we welcomed AWS as a planning customer along with NPR and Storskogen Group. And finally, our win rates remained strong and we see a growing pipeline of opportunities to replace our legacy ERP competitors. On the partner front, we've always recognize the vital role our ecosystem plays in our customers success and it starts with go-lives. HCM go-lives this quarter included American Electric Power. Dave and Buster's and Iberdrola, along with financials go-lives at NorthShore University Health System, SolutionHealth and Weis Markets. Increasingly, we're leaning into our partner ecosystem in other strategic ways. Our skills accelerate our partnership with Accenture, which we announced at EMEA rising is a great example. Accenture will be reselling our skill solution providing their own services expertise on-top of the Workday's Skills Cloud. We also announced a partnership with ADP to extend the capability of Workday HCM with ADP's payroll and smart compliance solutions in key global markets. And we announced AI marketplace at Rising, which allows us to innovate with our ecosystem of partners to deliver trusted and responsible AI solutions for our customers most compelling use cases. Finally, we see strong momentum from our partner referral program we launched earlier this year. We've already exceeded our full year target for the number of partners that have signed on. And while it's early, we are starting to see a positive impact to our pipeline. Another key investment area is around AI, which we've been building into our platform for nearly a decade. As I mentioned at Rising, we demonstrated our leadership with new announcements and demos that illustrated how AI will shape the future of work. I won't steal Aneel's thunder, he'll be joining in just a minute to share more. In closing, we had another quarter of strong and consistent performance amidst a dynamic environment. The diversity and mission critical nature of our business continues [Technical Difficulty] to fuel our success. As we move through Q4, we have a solid pipeline and clear [Technical Difficulty]. And while we are clearly focused on delivering in the near-term. We have our sights set on delivering durable [Technical Difficulty] while expanding margins. With that, I'll turn it over to my Co-CEO and good friend Aneel, who will share more about our AI strategy and innovation highlights from the quarter. Aneel, over to you.\nAneel Bhusri: Thank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call. As you heard Carl mentioned an increasing number of organizations across all industries and geographies are continuing to place their trust in Workday, which is why we remain focused on delivering the innovation our customers need to thrive in today's environment. For the last couple of quarters, we've highlighted our longstanding and differentiated approach to AI, including generative AI. That is driven by our platform strategy, unrivalled dataset, emphasis on being human centric and commitment to delivering responsible and trustworthy solutions. At Workday Rising in September, our leadership in this space were showcased in a big way as we unveiled a series of new AI capabilities that will help redefine the way our customers work. On the generative AI front, we announced several new capabilities that will benefit all users with an emphasis on increasing productivity. Growing and retaining talent, streamlining business processes and driving better decision making. Examples of the use cases we previewed, which we expect to be available next year include the ability to generate job descriptions in minutes versus hours, analyzing correct contracts for faster, more accurate revenue recognition. Create employee growth plans to foster and retain talent and provide text-to-code generation capabilities to increase productivity of app development in Workday Extend. Another way we're infusing generative AI into our platform is through our investment in conversational AI. While we are still in the exploratory phase with this technology. We believe conversational AI will fundamentally change how users interact with Workday. By enabling them to easily surface information they need and interact with data through simple conversation. We're also leveraging generative AI to create a conversational experience for Workday Adaptive Planning customers. The use of conversational text will simplify the process of surfacing key planning insights. Enabling users to make quicker, more strategic decisions about their businesses. Additionally, we announced enhancements to Workday Extend, which continues to be a critical solution to help bring the Workday platform to life for our customers and partners. In fact, we've seen an increase of more than 70% in the number of apps built by customers and partners with Extend in the last year alone. At Rising, we unveiled Workday AI gateway, which is available on Workday Extend. Our AI gateway provides developers with access to Workday's AI services to enhance our ability to build intelligent and responsible apps on the Workday platform. Turning to the office of the CHRO, we introduced several new features within Workday HCM that leverage AI, many with a focus on elevating the manager experience by providing them with the tools and insights they need to effectively lead and foster the career growth of their teams. One example is Manager Insights hub, which leverages AI to surface personalized recommendations and make it easier for managers to identify the best opportunities for their employees based on Skills interest to improve talent mobility and employee engagement. And while we will continue to deliver on the promise of AI for our customers, many of our partners and other enterprise companies are delivering on the promise of AI as well. As Carl mentioned, we announced our AI marketplace to help harness the AI innovation happening across our ecosystem. To date, we have 15 early adopters and that number will increase over time as we expand to include tailored solutions delivered by our partner ecosystem, Workday related capabilities in third-party products and native AI powered Workday Extend apps. Of course, none of these AI advancements can truly be effective without the right safeguards and regulations in-place. Building on our continued efforts to advocate for smart AI policy at the federal level. Workday's Josh Lannon, Vice President of Productivity Technology was invited to testify before Congress on AI in the future of work. Josh spoke to the potential of AI to enhance how workers collaborate and amplify human potential and the steps Workday is taking to deploy these technologies in a trustworthy and responsible manner. At the application level, Workday products continue to be recognized for the innovation that we deliver to customers. For the office of the CHRO Workday was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for cloud HCM suites for 1,000 plus employee enterprises. Workday was positioned highest for ability to execute and it marked the eighth consecutive year we were recognized as a leader. Additionally, Workday VNDLY was named a 2023 top HR product of the year by Human Resource Executive. The award recognized VNDLY's ability to provide organizations with the full set of capabilities for end-to-end lifecycle management of external workers and its ability to integrate with Workday HCM to support full visibility into headcount spend and more. And for the Office of the CFO, Workday was named a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud ERP for service centric enterprises based on completeness of vision and ability to execute. This is the second year in a row that Workday was recognized as a leader. In closing, I want to thank the entire Workday team for their incredible efforts in Q3. We have an amazing opportunity in front of us and I remain confident in our ability to capitalize on it. Thanks in large part to our more than 18,300 workmates. They are relentlessly focused on driving innovation across the entire Workday platform to actively address our customers finance and HR needs. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Zane Rowe, over to you, Zane.\nZane Rowe: Thanks, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As Carl and Aneel mentioned, Q3 was a strong quarter, highlighting the durability of our business and ongoing market adoption for cloud financials and HCM. Turning to results. Subscription revenue in Q3 was $1.69 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $175 million, leading to total revenue of $1.87 billion, growth of 17%. U.S. revenue totaled $1.4 billion, growing 17% and international revenue totaled $462 million, growing at the same rate. As we have highlighted, we see significant long term international opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful driver of our growth. As we discussed at our recent Financial Analyst Day, we are providing our 12 month subscription revenue backlog or CRPO, which was $6.05 billion at the end of Q3, representing growth of 22%. The result was driven by strong new ACV bookings and healthy renewals with gross and net revenue retention rates of over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Early renewals in the quarter exceeded our expectations, adding more than a point of growth to 12 month backlog and early renewals from prior quarters also continued to benefit backlog growth in Q3. 24 months subscription revenue backlog was $10.58 billion at the end of Q3, up 23%. Early renewals in the quarter added nearly 2 points of growth to the results. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $18.45 billion, up 31%. Backlog benefits from increased contract duration, which speaks to our customers' continued commitment to our platform. Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $462 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 24.8%. Margin strength relative to our guidance was driven by revenue outperformance and the timing of certain expenses and investments, which we expect to build in the fourth-quarter. Q3 operating cash flow was $451 million, growing 10%. During Q3, we repurchased $148 million of our shares at an average price of $218.35 per share. And we had $139 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program as of quarter end. We intend to execute on the remaining authorization of our buyback during Q4. We ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to invest in growth areas in the business and we ended October with over 18,300 workmates around the globe. Now turning to guidance. Following our continued momentum in Q3, we are raising our full year FY 2024 subscription revenue guidance to $6.598 billion, representing 19% year-over-year growth. We expect Q4, subscription revenue to be $1.755 billion, representing 17% year-over-year growth. We now expect professional services revenue of $158 million in Q4 and $652 million for the full year. In Q4, we expect 12 month backlog to grow approximately 19%, this includes our current outlook for early renewals in the quarter. We plan to continue disclosing our 12 month, 24 month and total backlog, but intend to provide guidance on 12 months going forward. We are raising our FY 2024 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 23.8%, and for Q4, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.5% as we ramp-up our key investment areas. GAAP operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins respectively. The FY 2024 non-GAAP tax-rate remains at 19%, we are raising our FY 2024 operating cash flow outlook to $1.975 billion, growth of 19% year-over-year. In addition, we now expect FY 2024 capital expenditures of approximately $250 million. As we discussed at our recent Financial Analyst Day, we see considerable opportunity to drive durable profitable growth over the longer-term. The financial framework, which we shared in September is further bolstered by our Q3 performance and the momentum we see building across key growth areas of our business. In light of the continued uncertain macro and incorporating our Q4 outlook, we currently expect FY 2025 subscription revenue of approximately $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%. We also expect to expand our FY 2025 non-GAAP operating margins from FY 2024 levels. Our outlook contemplates incremental investments across our key growth initiatives, while delivering continued margin expansion as we scale and optimize the business. The confidence in our outlook is supported by the advocacy and support of our customers, partners and workmates, who are all key contributors to our success. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. Congrats on a great result. Thinking back on the Rising conference, the energy and enthusiasm was pretty remarkable. When you look back on that, how did you feel about the pipeline generation coming off of Rising and through November on the FINS side of the business. I noticed you mentioned an AWS planning win in that time frame, and do you see any early signs that might validate that the hiring wave you've had of these FINS dedicated sales reps can drive some bookings traction as they begin to ramp up in the next couple of quarters?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yeah, let me start and then Doug, I'll ask you if you have anything to add. So thanks for the question, Mark. Let me first start by saying thank you to our workmates and partners around the world for delivering our third consecutive outstanding quarter here in FY 2024. We often talk about the diversity and durability of our business, and it was once again on full display here in Q3. Our value proposition continues to resonate more than ever with our customers, and this gives us a very resilient and durable business. So just thank you to everyone for helping achieve another outstanding quarter. Directly to answer your question, Mark, as it relates to Rising, yes, you're exactly right. There was a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm coming out of the conference, and there was a lot of energy around the financials solution that we're bringing to market. And I will tell you, it wasn't just from our customers, but it was also from our partners who continue to invest on building out their practice around financials. As you know, for the last 10 months, we've talked multiple times about our investment in the financials business, and we are seeing early dividends, and I say early because we still have a lot of opportunity to grow the business going forward, but we see early dividends that those investments are paying off. Number-one, our pipeline around FINS continues to grow. Number two, we continue to sell both to net-new logos, our financials, and back into our customer base. Number three, all of the hiring we've done on our FINS go-to-market sales reps are actually impacting not just FINS sales, but also helping us drive full platform sales. We talked about full platform sales being up again this quarter, and I think that is just the strength of our financials in conjunction with what we already have as a strong HCM business. And lastly, I would say planning continues to do quite well. We did announce, last quarter we talked about Exxon landing a large financials deal, in this quarter we talked about AWS, which is a very significant land for us as well. So overall, we see the FINS opportunity being quite large. We talked about, only 25% of financials moving to the cloud, which just represents a huge opportunity for us and we are really pleased with our win rates against our competition there.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: All right, thank you very much. Congratulations on a wonderful finish for third quarter. Carl, you've been in the seat for little under a year, actually close to a year. You've cycled through one full Rising conference. You've had a chance to speak with partners, check the pulse of the customer. You went through a tough year of macro. Everybody [predicted] (ph) the session, thankfully we didn't have one. So where does that leave you with respect to your refreshed assessment of the next three to four years versus where you started? Thank you so much and congrats to the entire team here.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. I'm still here, by the way. Aneel, you want answer that question?\nAneel Bhusri: No.\nCarl Eschenbach: Of course. So first of all, Kash, thank you for your nice words. And thank you for the question. So let me start talking about Workday, I appreciate you saying almost a year, I can't wait till December hits because then it's officially a year and we no longer talk about it in terms of months. So we're almost a full year into this journey with my partner Aneel. Let me start by talking about Workday. One thing that I recognized when I was on the Board for five years, that I had an incredible culture and strong values, and that is more evident to me than ever before. And that's what continues to excite me about Workday as a whole. As it relates to, if you will, a refreshed outlook of the business and the opportunity, I see many ahead, and a number of them we're already leaning into throughout this year. First, our international opportunity. We spoke in my prepared remarks around the performance of our EMEA team growing the business significantly year-over-year and driving predictable results. We continue to see strong potential through the partner ecosystem that we're building and how we're getting leverage from them. So that's a huge opportunity for us. The third is, I just spoke about in answering Mark's question around financials. Financials represents a large opportunity for us that we're leaning into heavily. We've hired a lot of sales reps throughout this year. And if we continue to see the early results that we're seeing. The first three quarters of this year, Zane, and I will continue to fund additional growth on FINS and especially on the go-to-market side. And last, I think, one thing that I've really come to recognize and appreciate. Aneel talks about our unrivalled data set that we have compared to our competition out there, and that is paying dividends for us today, especially in the terms when you think about AI and Generative AI, no one has an enterprise large language model like Workday has and it is driving tangible and productive results for our customers through generative AI.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. And I'll echo the congrats on the quarter. Carl or Aneel, actually, I was wondering if you guys could just talk about where Gen-AI is and the decision making tree for your customers right now? Meaning, has it sort of sprung to the top so that your leadership in that category is having, I guess, an impact on win rates already? Is it something you sort of expect to continue to build? I was just kind of curious, everybody is sort of piloting AI right now, but I am kind of curious if your leadership is actually putting you in a position for your win rates to get stronger as we head into 2024? Thanks.\nCarl Eschenbach: I do think it will position us for our win rates to get stronger in 2024. At this point, I don't think people are making decisions yet, just purely on AI. I think it's something that every customer looks at to make sure that they're going to be covered with a new deployment or a customer knowing that Workday has them in a strong place, but they're still looking first and foremost at running their business and moving off of crappy legacy applications into the cloud. And we're unmatched in that category. And then when we add the AI stuff, I think it just checks that AI box. But, I would say that despite all the hype, it's still in the early days of actual large scale deployments of AI in HR and finance, we're ready, we're just -- we're waiting. I don't know Doug's with us. I don't Doug, you want to add anything on what's happening in the sales cycles.\nDoug Robinson: I think it does come out in the sales cycle, but in a different way. So we talk talent optimization. And talent optimization, the entire sort of value prop of it is built off of AI and ML. So while they're not saying show me your Gen-AI, they are saying show me how I'm going to move to a skills based economy, how am I going to reskill my workforce. And then it gives us a chance to showcase the innovation that we've got.\nKirk Materne: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLuv Sodha: Hi, this is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Thank you for taking our question. Zane, this one's for you. Early renewal activity has been fairly robust this year. And it supported backlog growth. I guess as you look out over the next few quarters. Could you just talk about your expectations for early renewals, but those continue to be a tailwind to backlog growth.\nZane Rowe: Yes, thanks for the question. As we've communicated over the last number of quarters, we've been very pleased with not only our backlog growth, that our new ACV growth and the renewal activity, both the scheduled renewal activity is growing nicely as well as the early renewal activity. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have some of that contemplated into the upcoming quarter and candidly into next year as well. I will point out that over the last 12 months, we have seen elevated growth rates in scheduled renewals, which has obviously helped with our backlog, but we're very pleased. I'll point out that we guide to, obviously, subscription revenue. So we're focused on subscription revenue, and I've given you an indicator of subscription revenue growth heading into FY 2025. We feel good about backlog and renewals as well, and just the overall health of the business. Carl?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, the only thing I'd add Aneel is, I think we always want to reiterate that our customers are driving the early renewals based on-demand. And if they want to buy additional SKUs to consolidate on our best-of-breed platform. We're not going to wait till renewal cycle to sell them additional products. We're going to do it when the customer is ready. Last quarter, we saw a nice uptick in SKUs being sold back into our customer base, that drive, if you will, these early renewals like Talent Optimization, Accounting Center, Prism and Extend are just four examples of what customers are demanding more from us, and we're -- driving those early renewals more than we are. We don't incent our sales force to do early renewals, it's all based on customer demand.\nLuv Sodha: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful, thanks so much for taking my question here. One of the things that stands out to me here is the strength in financials. You called out full platform wins here as a contributor. So great execution there. I'm just wondering, with these types of deals where you're seeing big organizations commit to the full platform, both FINS and HCM, are you finding that there's just an increased comfort level with the cloud for financials such that they're willing to make that leap now versus, say, in the past? Or is this simply just a function of you focusing more on those types of deals with some of the investments you've been making? Just curious to get some color on why now for that strength in full platform deals, particularly FINS? Thank you.\nDoug Robinson: Thanks for the question, this is Doug answering. I think first and foremost, we still think 25% of the market is all that's moved financials to the cloud. So it's still early innings. But the recent quarter pipeline build suggests that it's growing and that it's more consistent performance. And you look at verticals where it's really popping up. I think we even called this out, but healthcare alone grew over 50% in the quarter and over 50% of those deals were full platform. So there's enterprises like AdventHealth with 80,000 employees, 46 different hospitals at sort of massive scale buying into full transformation, human capital management, financials and supply chain on the Workday platform.\nCarl Eschenbach: And one other thing I'd add is, as we have really leaned into the mid-market or medium enterprise, those customers have a tendency to decide on a full platform approach between both Financials and HCM and that business had a really good quarter for us in Q3, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And those customers are absolutely leaning into a full platform decision at a given time when they're looking at transforming their business.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Yes. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. And, I guess, first of all, congratulations on a really strong quarter. It looks to me like you accelerated CRPO subscription bookings, which I know is a metric we're not supposed to look at, but we do. At the same time as your incremental growth on sales and marketing, actually, you were way more efficient. So I guess, what I want to ask about is, as I think about the matrix for next year and you talked about the growth algorithm, how do you stack rank which of those priorities you need to kind of hit on to get there? And then what prevents kind of like maybe what are some of the areas that you see leaning into on an incremental spending perspective that might be temporarily anchoring margins?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, you want to start Zane, then you can add color. So one of the biggest investments we've talked about a number of times already here is our investment in our financials go to market build out that is paying early dividends. I do think it's important to remember that a lot of these hires that have happened over the last three quarters of this year aren't fully ramped and don't hit full productivity till next year. So as they come up to speed, right, I think we'll see continued growth in the financials and overall business as we head into next year, because of this build out we're doing this year. We do continue to lean into our partner organization, we're hiring a number of people to manage all of the partners we're bringing on. An example would be, this year when we launched our referral program, we had a goal of signing up 100 partners in our referral program, and through three quarters, we already have 150 partners who have signed up. And it brought us hundreds of new leads and new opportunities both here and in our international business. So we'll continue to lean into that. And then, I think Aneel and Zane will continue to lean into investing in the product side, as we see a great opportunity to leverage that dataset and model that we talked about, to drive AI solutions in new SKUs into the market. So, I think it's a little bit more of the same. And we'll continue to lean into the investments we made this year as long as we continue to see the early signs that they're producing the results that we want.\nAneel Bhusri: Alex, I'll just add. As Carl is alluding to, obviously there's significant sales and marketing expense ahead of this. At the same time, we're investing in other key areas just around the globe. We're also looking at the product side. We're being very disciplined about how we think about that incremental growth and that incremental investment heading into next year. Which is why the outlook I gave aligns nicely with the framework that we have and we're confident that as you've seen this year we'll be very thoughtful on where we spend and how we spend. So, as you've seen, our guide increase from 23% earlier in the year to now 23.8%. As we look to next year, we have the benefit of expanding not only our revenue base, but also our margins throughout the course of next year. So we feel very good about where the business is, where those investments are. I'll point out obviously that as you know in this business the bookings come well ahead of the revenue. So we would expect to see revenue continue to build beyond FY 2025.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then maybe just if I squeeze in another one for Aneel. Coming out of the Analyst Day it did feel like at least on the macro front, there were kind of gathering storm clouds, whether it was a potential for government shutdown or labor strike or macro concerns. Did you feel maybe coming out of the quarter and as you look at into the kind of the big selling season that some of those it has indeed ebbed and maybe there's more of a conservative optimism that you're kind of seeing on the horizon?\nAneel Bhusri: I don't see conservative optimism. I kind of just see it's par for the course. I mean, we've just been in this dynamic -- I think dynamic is the right word. Somewhat complicated world now since before COVID. And what -- I'm proudest of the team, and I'm going to defer this question to Carl and to Doug is how they've executed through this, really challenging time. That's just very -- I don't want to say unpredictable, but it's not predictable.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Aneel, I think you said it well. I don't think we see any improvement in the macro or do we see it getting any worse. It's pretty consistent with what we've seen all year long and I'll just echo what Aneel says. I just want to give a hat tip to Doug and Patrick and our sales teams around the world for their understanding of how to navigate some of these choppy waters. We've said in the past, we continue to see heightening scrutiny on some deals, particularly net new but our teams have figured out how to navigate that and close a lot of business the first three quarters of the year. And even when opportunities may slip, they don't leave our pipeline, they just move out a quarter or two, because once people make a decision to do a transformation around HCM or financials, it's not if they're going to do it, it's when and I think that was very evident both this quarter, the first three quarter of the year, I should say, and I think that will continue going forward, but our teams are very skilled and very good at closing business as they call-it each quarter. I couldn't be more proud of them.\nAlex Zukin: Well, definite hats-up to you guys from us here. Congratulations.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Carl, you touched already on the partner build-out. Can we just double click on that one as well, like because, like what's the appetite at the moment on the partner side, to build out headcount around you, Obviously, economic times are tops and the SI's are usually late cycles, so they're only realizing now what's going on. Like, is that kind of still very much in investment mode on their side, or is there a pause from their side that could kind of potentially be a headwind for you going forward. But congrats from me as well there? Thank you.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you, Raimo, and thank you for the question. As it relates to the investments our partners are making, I do think they're investing in Workday. They already have very well established and mature HCM practices. But if you were at Rising and you spent time talking to our partners and the ecosystem there, what you would have heard is a lot of them see the opportunity, just like we do in financials, and they're investing heavily on building out their financials practice around Workday. And that was evident both at Rising here in the U.S. and just a few weeks ago at Rising in EMEA. So there is no doubt our partners are really leaning into us. And, by the way, I mentioned it earlier, they're also bringing lots of opportunities to us because for the first time this year, we're giving them an incentive to bring us as net new opportunities as part of our referral program. So, yeah, the investment is happening.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thank you. I guess for Carl or Aneel, I wanted to ask about traction with Extend and how that plays into the AI opportunity for you. I think you've talked about this is the platform that helps integrate into Workday models, into third-party AI models, that helps unlock a lot of private data and that you'll look to maybe introduce new tiered pricing for Extend. But can you just talk about how you see Extend helping to drive AI monetization for you guys in the medium?\nCarl Eschenbach: Well, so Extend has been one of our best kept secrets before the AI gateway for the last several years. For the longest time, customers wanted extensibility and instead we had frankly build every feature they wanted into the product and we give them Extend and they're able to develop the features that are unique to their own business. And basically that same story plays out with AI, where, I think we've got a great strategy for embedding AI into our products. You'll see a series of new SKUs over time. They are built on -- they built around AI technologies. But the AI gateway around Extend unleashes partners and customers to do AI things that may be very unique to their business that we would never build into our core products. So it's been huge. And, I also think, you'll see ISVs, leverage the AI Extend gateway and continue to build products using that technology, which will only extend our ecosystem and make our customers even happier with the offerings that they have in front of them. I think Extend is kind of a secret weapon for us, especially now with the AI gateway. And we are monetizing it and I think we'll continue to monetize it. I mean maybe Doug wants to talk about how we're monetizing it and how much more we can do.\nDoug Robinson: I think the best example of that is the Accenture Skills Cloud that we announced with Accenture, this quarter, Aneel. So essentially, they've taken extend and build IP on-top of it and then they are also taking Workday journeys, Workday Skills Cloud, Workday learning and reselling it. On behalf of Workday into the market to different customers. So they're packaging it up with a set of services around it and then driving revenue on our behalf. So there's lots of exciting opportunities like that, that's just one example.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Maybe I'll direct this one to Zane. Zane out-of-the Investor Day, there was some degree of investor angst about the margin outlook and yet, here tonight, you've raised your full year margins and you're guiding to up margins next year. Just curious, has your thought process changed at all in terms of the OpEx trajectory over the next several years, perhaps it's not quite as front end loaded as you were thinking. Does this imply maybe you feel a little bit better about the revenue outlook and that's flowing through to perhaps a better than expected margin outlook next year? Love to get a little bit more color and to sort of contrast it to the Investor Day commentary.\nZane Rowe: Sure, Karl. Yeah, happy to answer that. I thought you're going to ask me about my first five months here, but I'll go ahead with the margin question instead. I'd say no change from the framework that we discussed, but as you point out, obviously we've been pleased with the revenue we've seen through the course of the year, obviously increasing our margin outlook for the year and then leaning into the margin, increasing into next year as well. So it's a little bit of all the above. We feel confident with our strategy, with the revenue growth we've seen. We're always going to be thoughtful as we articulated at our financial Analyst Day around those investments that we're making, but we want to have that capacity to make those investments where we believe it makes sense and we expect to do that into FY 2025 and well beyond that. I've also pointed out previously that where we see opportunities to increase that operating margin, we'll continue to do that and let it drop to the bottom line as well. So broadly speaking, no change in our outlook. But you're right in pointing out that when we have those opportunities, we'll let it drop to the bottom line.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, thank you Zane.\nZane Rowe: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you. So, Aneel and Carl. I'm wondering how you see your partnership evolving when Aneel takes the Executive Chair role in January. And Aneel any lessons from Dave's transition to chair back in 2014.\nAneel Bhusri: Wow, okay, so. Second one cut me off guard a little bit. I'll just -- I'll answer the second one first. You know everything is a continuum and I still talk to Dave almost weekly and he is still the touchstone for a lot of things that happen at Workday. But you know what he said to me when I became the CEO. There can only be one captain of the ship. And I'd say the same thing about Carl. I'm excited about Carl being the captain of the ship. And frankly, what I've seen over the last almost a year, we're just nine days away from the year. December 10th was the date. Carl's amazing, and he is driving the business in ways that I never could have. And so I'm really happy in transitioning back to a product and innovation and strategy role, which is really how Workday got started with Dave and I. And those are my roots. So I'm very excited and our working relationship has been great, but I think more importantly and I would say this is the same with Dave and I. Workday is a company built on friendship, it was first Dave and I, and now it's Carl and I and I think that's really powerful and that's what makes me very confident and optimistic about the future.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. And the only thing I want to add is, Aneel is going to be sticking around. He is truly -- I know we like to use the Rockstar term here at Workday. He is the rock -- a Rockstar in the software industry. And just watching Aneel's energy the last three or four months diving deep into AI. Driving our product and technology strategy has been amazing, and I can't wait to see him continue to do that even as he steps into this new capacity. He's truly a genius when it comes to product and product strategy. He is not going anywhere, period. I know he's my boss as an Executive Chair, but I also want to be his boss sometimes and tell him he's not going anywhere.\nPat Walravens: Okay, great, thank you both.\nOperator: We will now take two more questions. Our next question is from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Berg: Hi everyone. Congrats on the really nice quarter here. And thanks for taking my question. I guess my question is probably for Doug. I know it's early and I know that Workday has had AI interwoven into the platform for obviously couple years, but with a renewed sense of kind of customer interest in the space last six months, I guess, what are you seeing now for an appetite to actually pay for some advanced or incremental functionality around some of the Gen-AI technologies out there? I think a lot of the questions we get is around -- from investors is will customers actually pay for this? Now that you have maybe three to six months under your hat, any viewpoint there would be helpful. Thank you.\nDoug Robinson: I'll answer it from a broader AI perspective and I think the answer is yes. Customers will pay for where they see business value. And if you remember at Analyst Day, we highlighted that in the previous 12 months. Talent optimization increased attach to 45% from 35% in just 12 months. I look at the top three SKUs that sold within the quarter of Q3 and talent optimization was right in that top three. So, I think they're willing to pay for business value and we're seeing a lot of energy. In some ways it feels like early days of Workday, and I was part of early days of Workday where our customers come with great energy to co-innovate with us and what can we do together. And they share some of the things they're experimenting with, and we share some of the things we're experimenting with. But we've talked about this for several quarters in a row. There is a desire to consolidate vendors and to consolidate onto a platform and leverage that platform. So I do think there is a willingness to pay and I do think it shows up in the results.\nCarl Eschenbach: If I could add one other thing, I would just say that the point solutions that are being created by startups are proving that customers are willing to pay for AI, only AI native equivalent of co-pilots. These companies are getting substantial deals done and they are adding -- I think they're adding value and they're part of our ecosystem. And it's a good proof point that customers are willing to pay for it if they see the value.\nScott Berg: Great. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Schwartz: Thank you very much. This question is for Carl or Doug. Just wanted to tap into what you're hearing in the C-Suite in terms of prioritizing IT spend for next year. If we think about this year, clearly, there was a prioritization on technologies that drove efficiency and business cost optimization. Do you have any early read on how the C-Suite at large enterprises are thinking about prioritizing IT spending for next year? Thank you.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, thanks Brian. For the question. Doug you want me to start and then you go.\nDoug Robinson: Yes.\nCarl Eschenbach: Okay. So I think there's probably three demands we're seeing right now out of the C-Suite. Number one, talent. Talent is clearly a C-Suite priority, and companies are all focused right now on reskilling and upskilling their workforces. And they're also really focused on driving a better employee experience to keep the employees around longer and therefore drive better productivity. So I would say talent is a C-Suite priority. The other thing I would say is leaning into something you mentioned, is they are looking to consolidate, and they're looking to consolidate their IT spend. And in doing so, they're driving more of a platform approach. And I think we have a platform where people are consolidating on top of. And when you do that, you have a better total cost of ownership. And I know we've talked a little bit about AI on this call, and we'll continue to do so for many years to come. But I think AI is really becoming a business imperative, and they're all trying to figure out how to leverage it. And I think as they do so, they're going to lean towards vendors who they trust like Workday to be able to deliver those AI solutions and really drive impact to their employees and their overall productivity gains they're seeking as a company. That's what we're seeing, but. Doug, you're out there touching even more customers than I. So I'd like you to respond too.\nDoug Robinson: Well, you covered mine, but I'd say, I agree with you. Best of suite versus best of breed. There's a desire for that, which is that consolidation play. And you touched on the other one I was going to hit, which is a renewed energy around efficiency and productivity with business applications. So get employees in and out, drive great efficiency. And that, by the way, has the side effect of driving a better employee experience. And so while there's all this talent and skills and employee experience focus, there is -- CIOs come into our corporate visit center and saying, how do I get more productivity? How do I get more efficiencies? And that's where the Gen-AI conversations get really interesting.\nBrian Schwartz: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Robinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. I'll now turn it back to Mr. Eschenbach for final comments.\nCarl Eschenbach: Sure. [indiscernible] that works too. No problem. Thank you, operator and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. And a special thanks to our workmates, customers and partners around the globe that continue to fuel Workday's success. Q3 was another strong quarter, highlighted by durable mission critical nature of our platform and it only reinforces the excitement we have both in Q4 and the opportunity we have ahead. We are all well-positioned here at Workday, and we're focused on executing in Q4 and laying the foundation for a durable growth in FY 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll hand it back over to the operator to close today's call and I hope everyone has a great evening and a happy holiday season.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question only. I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJustin Furby: [Technical Difficulty] Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our Co-CEOs; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our Company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our third quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on October 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Call. I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter, achieving subscription revenue growth of 19%, 24-month backlog growth of 23%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. While we continue to see deal scrutiny, our workmates around the world did a remarkable job, staying close to our customers in driving this quarter's result in positioning us for strength in the second-half of the year and beyond. Workday continues to stand-out from the crowd for a few key reasons. First, the mission-critical nature of our platform. Our customers now representing more than 65 million users under contract are all in on Workday, because they trust us to manage their two most important assets, their people and their money. Trust is at the core of our customer relationships and we will always work to earn it. Second, our value proposition is strengthening as businesses consolidate their technology footprint from best-of-breed solutions to a true platform. Workday is a trusted platform, they can turn to drive productivity gains, agility, skills-based talent strategies, and a great employee experience all at the same time. Third is our unique approach to AI and ML. Aneel will share more on our progress here shortly. And finally, our winning culture and talent, which is only getting stronger as we continue to attract our industry's best talent. We recently welcomed Emma Chalwin as Chief Marketing Officer. Emma is not only a great culture fit, but she has extensive global experience across all facets of marketing at companies like Salesforce and Adobe. We also recently hired an incredible Head of our U.S. Federal Government team and a Senior Executive in sales operations, and another in our services organization to help us scale our go-to-market efforts. And of course, you all know our CFO, Zane Rowe, who is joining us today for his first earnings call. I could not be more excited to welcome these leaders who along with our existing team will help us achieve our next phase of growth. Turning to the highlights of the quarter. I will focus on five key areas, land, expand, global, industries, and partners. Starting with land, we see full financials in HCM platform wins on the rise, illustrating the trust customers have in Workday. Wins this quarter include ADVOCATE Health Assured Partners, Carillion Services for Tria, KinderCare and University of Florida. And we continue to build on our market leadership position in HCM, with new customer wins, including Fresenius, digital technologies, Stellantis, and Rio Tinto. Once we land customers, we immediately turn our efforts to successful deployments. In Q2 notable HCM go lives include A1 Telekom Austria, Korean Airlines, Nike, and Rite Aid. Strategic financial go-lives include fitness international, multi-care health systems, Wintrust, and the University of Washington. We also celebrated our first FedRAMP go-live which was a full platform rollout at a well-known civilian agency. Expanding our existing business with customers is key to our growth strategy. In addition to strong renewals this quarter we had a number of expansions at companies such as Airbus, Dell Technologies, Lloyds Bank, those companies in 7-Eleven. Our faster time-to-value solutions, which includes planning, Picon, Extend, health and talent optimization continue to gain traction with many deals created and closed within the quarter. This year we put increased focus on financials go-to-market and it's starting to bear fruit with healthy customer growth in Q2. Beyond the full platform deals I mentioned earlier, we had a number of financial expansion wins in the quarter, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, Nordic Consulting, and Rakuten. Given our momentum, we continue to invest in financials targeted sellers to lay the foundation for durable growth. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. continues to be our largest market, representing 75% of our revenue. The U.S. team drove solid results in Q2 with particular strength coming from our customer base in industry teams. We have a significant runway for growth in this market in a healthy pipeline looking-forward. Expanding our footprint globally is among our largest untapped opportunities and is a top priority. During Q2, we held 20 Elevate customer events across EMEA and APJ, attracting over 5,000 attendees and generating hundreds of leads in net new opportunities. Not only are we building pipeline, we're starting to see more consistent execution in certain regions, notably EMEA. We saw strength in key markets such as Germany, U.K. and France. Where wins included Renus assets, Symrise, National West Mr. Bank in ALD Automotive SA. Our industry-first approach is paying off. This quarter, retail and hospitality became our second industry joining Financial Services to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, and we continue to have strong momentum in financial services which outperformed in Q2. The health care team also delivered another strong performance with 3 large hospital systems going all in on Workday's platform in Q2. A great example is ADVOCATE Health, which is part of their merger with Atrium Health selected Workday to replace a competitor's cloud HCM financials and supply chain management solution. Workday supply chain continues to contribute to our traction in health care with more than 220 health care organizations investing in it to reduce costs, promote standardization and boost resiliency. Finally, our education and government team followed up a strong start to the year with an impressive Q2, with wins such as West Virginia University, the Paul University and Metropolitan Community College to name a view. The potential we have to accelerate our growth through our partner community is huge. We are seeing early signs that our partner referral program will positively impact new logos and our partnership with the AWS marketplace led to multiple strategic wins in Q2. In EMEA, our recently announced payroll partnership with ELI is beginning to drive pipeline. And in APJ, our strategic partnership expansion with Samsung SDS is not only helping us drive overall business in South Korea. It also is enabling the development of region-specific applications built on Workday Extend. After spending time with many of our partners at our annual Altitude conference this past quarter, it is clear our momentum is building. We look forward to welcoming more than 15,000 members of our Workday community at our annual Workday Rising Conference next month in San Francisco. We hope to see many of you there. As this quarter's results show the diversity and mission-critical nature of our business continues to fuel our success. We are the clear market leader for cloud HCM and finance and our value proposition has never been more relevant or powerful. We are investing across our product portfolio, geographies, industries and through partnerships to drive durable long-term growth. It is an incredible and exciting time to be a work made and I truly believe our future has never been brighter. With that, I will turn it over to my Co-CEO and good friend, Aneel, who will share more about our AI and ML strategy and innovation highlights from the quarter. Aneel, over to you.\nAneel Bhusri: Thank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call and especially to our nearly 17,900 workmates around the world for helping deliver another solid quarter. I couldn't agree more with the sentiment that our future is extremely bright. I've been on the road a lot recently to meet with current and prospective customers, and one thing is abundantly clear. More and more organizations are looking to Workday to be their trusted partner to help them navigate today's business landscape and thrive in this new world of work. Critical to our ability to be that trusted partner is our continued focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, including generative AI. . Last quarter, I highlighted Workday's unique approach to AI and ML, which began in earnest in 2014 with a focus on 3 key aspects. AI and ML are embedded into the core of our platform, we place an emphasis on being human-centric with our AI and ML strategy, and we continue to believe the true potential of AI and ML can only be met by ensuring that is leveraged in a trustworthy and ethical way. Looking ahead, Journal of AI will continue to be a major focus for us. Despite the recent hype cycle, Workday has been using large language models for years, and we're continuing to invest in a big way. What helps further set Workday apart is our unrivaled data set quality, which is fueled by our more than 65 million users under contract and $600 billion annual transactions to create data models that provide accurate, meaningful and most importantly, trustworthy results. We're currently building product capabilities that leverage generative AI for a variety of tests. Examples include natural language generation, content search, content summarization, content augmentation and document understanding. And we're looking beyond those use cases at how we can also leverage copilots, agents and conversational UI. Each will help our customers redefine the way they work, and we look forward to previewing these new capabilities along with the rest of our latest AI developments at Workday Rising in September. All told, our differentiated approach is working as we are seeing continued momentum across the board with our over 3,000 customers having opted into sharing their data with our ML models. And we know they are realizing value once they have opted in as we are processing more than 50 million ML inferences per day, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year. Furthermore, we believe that the enhanced value that AI and generative AI provide to our customers will also create economic benefits to Workday by positively influencing competitive win rates, renewal rates and our already industry-leading customer satisfaction. We plan to offer most AI capabilities to our customers who opt in as part of their current product subscription with generous based usage entitlements. We also expect AI to open up new market opportunities with direct monetization that are wholly based on AI technologies, similar to our talent optimization solution that leverages Skills Cloud, one of our fastest-growing SKUs. Last quarter, I also shared our perspective on the growing importance of AI safeguards and the active role we're playing in driving the development of smart regulations. Since then, the EU has entered final negotiations on its AI Act which we expect to shape AI regulation globally. We've worked closely with policymakers in Europe over the last two years, and we're pleased to see many of our suggestions accepted in the Parliaments version that was recently approved. In the U.S., under the leadership of Sayan Chakraborty, our Co-President, we played a leading role in helping develop the AI framework for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, which is a how to guide for organizations to develop and use trustworthy AI. We are leading by example by implementing the NIST AI framework, and we're working with Congress to encourage adoption of it throughout the federal government. We are also helping to drive the conversation with lawmakers at the state level, including California as they look to find a path forward for new AI regulations. We're helping them develop legislative frameworks that build trust and AI tools while driving innovation across the enterprise. As we continue to drive thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI, you'll hear more from us on our work in the EU, the U.S. and around the world at this pivotal moment for AI policy. On the application front, we're continuing to see our innovation story resonate with customers who are increasingly selecting Workday over the competition. According to Gartner Enterprise Application Software as a Service, market share research, which was published in Q2, Workday had the highest worldwide market share in 2022 for SaaS ERP at 21%. Additionally, we crossed another milestone in Q2 with more than 5,000 core HCM and finance customers, a testament to the power of the Workday platform. For the office of the CFO, we enhanced Workday Adaptive Planning with the next generation of our patented Elastic Hypercube technology. Powered by new AI and performance improvements, Workday Adaptive Planning can now support our customers' most complex planning requirements. Scaling automatically without sacrificing speed or performance. Further proof to the continued momentum we are seeing with this application Workday Adaptive Planning was named Best Financial Management Solution in the 2023 SIIA CODI wards. Workday was also named a Customer's Choice in the 2023 Gartner Peer Insights voice of the customer for financial planning software report. Additionally, Workday Accounting Center is proving to be a true difference maker for the office of the CFO, as shown by the 70% year-over-year growth at experienced in Q2. Today, accounting center is helping more than 150 customers across a dozen industries to pull from a larger, more diverse spectrum of operational data sources to deliver increased granular insights and allow them to better understand their profitability, all in one system. And for the office of the CHRO, Workday HCM was named a leader in the Forrester Wave Human Capital Management Q2 2023 report which highlighted our investments in Vetley and Workday Pecan employee voice as well as our use of embedded AI and ML to reduce user friction. In closing, I'm confident that our continued focus on driving innovation across the entire Workday platform will not only position us for future growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue but also play an integral role in helping us continue to build the highest levels of trust with our more than 10,000 customers. I'm excited to see many of you next month for Workday Rising which is back in the Bay Area for 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Zane Rowe. As Carl pointed out earlier, Zane has been a perfect fit since joining Workday last quarter, and I'm thrilled to have him on board. Over to you, Zane. Over to you, Zane.\nZane Rowe: Thanks, Aneel. As this is my first earnings call as Workday's CFO, I want to start by saying how honored I am to partner alongside you Aneel, Carl and all of our fellow workmates around the globe. I joined Workday because I thought it was one of the most compelling opportunities in all of enterprise software. The continued strength we saw in Q2 further reinforces that belief. Turning to the quarter. Subscription revenue in Q2 was $1.62 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $163 million, leading to total revenue of $1.79 billion growth of 16%. From a geographic perspective, total revenue outside the U.S. was $442 million, representing 25% of total revenue and 15% growth in Q2. As Carl mentioned, we see significant long-term international growth opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful portion of our revenue mix. 24-month subscription revenue backlog was $10.27 billion at the end of Q2, up 23%, driven by new ACV bookings and strong renewals with gross and net revenue retention rates of over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Early renewals in the quarter exceeded our expectations and added roughly 1.5 points of growth to 24-month backlog. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.85 billion, up 32%. Early renewals in the quarter added roughly 3 points to the growth. In addition, we continue to see longer contract duration on both net new deals and renewals, which speaks to our customers' continued commitment to our platform and is causing our total backlog growth to significantly outpace growth in the 24-month backlog. Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $421 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.6%. Margin strength relative to our guidance was driven by revenue out-performance and the timing of certain expenses. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, which benefited from the timing of collections in the quarter. During Q2, we repurchased $139 million in shares at an average price of $218.33 per share. and we had $287 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, and we ended Q2 with nearly 17,900 global workmates. We are pleased with our financial performance in Q2 and focused on continuing to drive results in the second-half while investing to support longer-term growth. Now turning to guidance. Following our momentum in the first-half of the year, we are raising our full-year FY '24 subscription revenue guidance to a new range of $6.57 billion to $6.59 billion representing 18% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be $1.678 billion to $1.68 billion, representing 17% year-over-year growth. We're maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of $630 million to $650 million as we continue to strategically shift more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy. For Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $165 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 21% year-over-year in Q3. This includes our current outlook for early renewals in the quarter. We are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 23.5% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach of investing in long-term growth while we expand margins. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.5%. GAAP operating margins for the third quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We expect FY '24 operating cash flow of $1.95 billion, growth of 18% year-over-year. As we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate making our first semiannual payment of our employee cash bonus plan in Q3, which impacts our annual cash flow and quarterly seasonality for FY '24. In addition, we continue to expect FY '24 capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. I'll close by thanking our terrific community of customers and partners for their continued support. And I look forward to seeing many of you in the investment community at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on September 27 in San Francisco. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much, and the energy on the call is just so palpable. It looks like there is a lot of new leadership changes. Congrats Zane on joining a great team here. I had one thing or maybe two things. The importance of data in the world of AI, you have data on 65 million professional workers. At a high level, how could you possibly monetize with AI, the value of this data in the years ahead, and therefore its implications for the pricing power of Workday? And if you could, are there any pent-up areas within the portfolio that might have taken a bit of a seat-back because of the caution in the spending environment? If that caution goes away, where do you see maybe geographies or product segments that could do even better in the year ahead? Thank you so much and congratulations.\nAneel Bhusri: So Kash, I'll take on the first part. Good to hear your voice. The data is really valuable because it lets us train the large language models. And what you'll see us do is have with the large data sets, we can only train the large language models. We can then do domain-specific large language models, and those are smaller and less expensive. And we turn around and use those models to either make our products more competitive or they're the basis of new SKUs like the Skills Cloud. I think you see us more in the mode of new SKUs like Skills Cloud rather than actually charging for any insight from the data -- that it's the customer's data. They allow us to use it in an anonymized way and we give them the results back. But I think what it allows us to do is train these large language models and then domain specific ones that will create new SKUs.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. And just one quick add-on then we'll talk about some of the other questions Kash, great to hear your voice. And I think it's important to know that Aneel and Dave did from the beginning is they built this platform and they built AI and ML deep into the platform. So it's been built in, and we've already seen a positive economic impact to Workday through our industry-leading customer set, our renewal rates and competitive win rates still remain strong because of AI and ML and it's built in from the beginning. So I think that's a differentiator for us against those 65 million users and $600 billion, transactions that we get on the platform a year. As it relates to your second question, maybe I'll start, Doug, and then you can jump in. we haven't seen any pullback due to the -- any macro headwinds in any of the things we're selling into the market. If anything, I think our value proposition is only resonating more cash as people look to consolidate multiple products who are sometimes called best-of-breed onto best of suite platforms. and they're consolidating on top of Workday for both their financials and their HCM and the wrapping our adaptive planning product around both. So we continue to see strong momentum across the board. And you mentioned geographies -- our European team continues to do quite well. We've talked about it the last couple of quarters and our focus on international, and they continue to deliver for us. They're much more predictable and they're driving strong pipeline in EMEA -- and then we'll still continue to work on APJ to grow that business out. Doug, do you want to add any additional color?\nDoug Robinson: I think that's -- some of that I was -- echo as well. I think just as you coined it sort of the lift in caution, cash. I think that caution is still out there, and that still shows up in the additional deal scrutiny. But I would say, just to give you a little more insight, we were really pleased with the performance of U.S. large enterprise -- and Carl mentioned to me, the -- I attribute that to execution as much as maybe a lift in caution, but it's been really nice execution across Europe in the first-half.\nKash Rangan: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. And congrats on absolutely stellar performance. Zane, I'm wondering if you can dimensionalize at all the FINS quota capacity increase that you're bringing on board? Or how much you could bring on just relative to the demand signals that you're seeing out there? And then for Carl or Aneel, I'm curious if you see more opportunities out there in the mid-market. Or perhaps sensing an inflection up at the Global 2000 level for some of the customers that might need to handle complicated currencies or legal entities, minority interest, country localizations, that type of an arrangement?\nZane Rowe: Sure, Mark. I'm happy to start and then hand over to Carl. As you point out, we're bringing on some significant amount of thin sellers as we see that opportunity, I'd say, both on the domestic side and on the international side. I'd say it's still early days there as we bring them on. Obviously, it will take some time for us to all of those benefits, but it's clearly a focus area for us. I will tell you that the unit growth in FINS this quarter was tremendous and exceeded our expectations. So we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing and optimistic about what we can do in the future there on FINS with the additional go-to-market capacity.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, Zane, thanks for that color. Yes, Mark, as you know, six months ago, we decided to put a big investment in the go-to-market side, specifically around FINS. And while it takes six to 12 months to get your reps up and ramped, we're seeing early indications of it providing significant leverage in the business. One of the ways it's turned up here this quarter, as Zane just talked about, is we saw a really good growth in a number of new FINS units sold on a year-over-year basis into the market. But it's more than just selling FINS. We're also seeing the knowledge set that we have across the field now with financials is actually impacting our full platform sales. our full platform sales are only accelerating as we sell both HCM and FINS into the market at the same time. And we saw that specifically kind of into your next question, in the medium enterprise business. The medium enterprise, we see full platform sales very regularly at this point. And I think that's attributed to the build-out of our FINS sales force. And then the last thing I talk about is the FIN sales force helps us continue to drive a land sale with planning. Planning continues to be a good product for us. We're landing with it, and it opens up the door for us to go back and sell both FINS and full platform into those customers that we landed with planning. So there is no doubt at this time that the FINS build-out of the sales force is paying dividends. As it relates to the medium enterprise, we had a really solid quarter in what we described the medium enterprise segment. And I think the highlight there was specifically we're seeing more and more full platform sales into that market segment. And we're very pleased with their performance, specifically here in the U.S., and we're going to replicate that internationally as we build out the medium enterprise globally.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Oh, wonderful. Thanks and great to see the great results here. I wanted to ask one on the expand success that you're seeing here. I know Carl has been an initiative here to go back to the base here. Is there any color you could provide as to where you're seeing particular strength? There's so many modules within HCM and FINS that I would love to get some color from you as to where you're seeing success there. And then the second question would just be on the macro, you mentioned that deal scrutiny is still there. Is that outsized in office of HR versus office of CFO, where might we see some potential acceleration coming out of the macro and any differences there? Thank you.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, sure. So yes, we -- one of the things we really like about our business model is what we describe as both the diversity and the durability of our business. From a diversity perspective, we're still landing a significant portion of our business on net new deals, which is really exciting to see. And when you land net new deals, what that provides you is a platform to sell back into your customer base, and we have two different selling motions there. In this quarter when we had a really balanced performance across selling back to the customer base and landing net new -- and that's a motion that we're going to keep leaning into. And by the way, we talked about FINS when we're adding FINS sellers, we're separating them into selling net new FINS and back into the customer base. So this motion is clearly working for us. As it relates to macro, maybe I'll just do a high level and then ask Doug to chime in and see what he's seeing since he's with customers daily. Nothing has changed over the last few quarters. And because of that, we continue to perform quite well because I think our sales force is very skilled at navigating the extra scrutiny they're going to get. As well as they're doing really well at understanding the sales process and their closing deals and they're getting them across the finish line. That's both a tribute to our sales force globally, but I also think it comes back to the strong value proposition we're providing customers as we continue to be the platform they're choosing to support both their people and their finances, their two most precious assets. So it's a combination of good execution, understanding the sales cycle and us continuing to have a strong value proposition for our customers and prospects. And I'll ask Doug to call or add any additional color on the macro.\nDoug Robinson: Yes. Thank you, Carl, and nice to talk to you, Brad. From a macro perspective, you asked the question whether it shows up in one area or the other, I think you meant between HCM or FINS, and I'd say not really. I think it's fair to say that the extra scrutiny is on any dollar spent in corporate America or across the globe is getting that scrutiny. So it is sort of across the board. I would say perhaps more pronounced, I don't know if scrutiny is the right way to describe it in net new versus customer base, which is why the customer base has been such an important part of our motion over the last two years at the company. Which was your first question around expand. So in that motion, we really sort of see two key things. One is this notion of create and close or what we call speed SKUs or speed solutions. So just to highlight there, Peakon planning, talent optimization, those tend to go quick time to value and tend to be really strong in quarter sort of create opportunities and close. But at the same time, we have our customers or the customer base doing larger, what I would describe as more strategic enterprise type agreements. We talked about the expansions across Airbus, Lloyds Bank, Lowe's, 7-Eleven this quarter. Those are already big customers committed to the platform but have taken on an even more strategic approach with us as they look to consolidate vendors and standardize on our platform.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful to hear. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Thank you very much. And I'll echo the welcome to Zane. Good to hear from you again. Carl, I was wondering if you could just double-click a little bit on international. And what you're seeing in that region, maybe across some of the products. And I was wondering if you could also just talk about the investments that you're making today and sort of the opportunity for those to kind of come to fruition from a bookings perspective next year? I guess just a little bit more color on international would be helpful.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. So I'll talk specifically about EMEA, which both Doug and I already mentioned -- but this is an area that we -- I think you are aware, over the last couple of quarters, we've shared that we brought in a lot of new leadership across the region, both in the U.K. at the entire EMEA level. In dock in France. So we've really built out their leadership team there, and they're actually bringing in more and more talent underneath them, and it is starting to clearly pay dividends. We are seeing early signs of solid pipeline build that's much more predictable than we've seen in the past. We see more predictability in the business, because they have their arms around it. And they are selling both HCM and FINS successfully. The other thing we're seeing, which is a little bit of replication from what we're seeing here in the U.S., as you know, the EMEA market as a whole is very much a medium enterprise business. And they're doing really well at selling full platforms into the EMEA market where customers see the true value of combining both HCM and financials and again, wrapping planning around it for that full platform sale. So we definitely are seeing the momentum there. And we do have some big competitors in our backyard there, but when we look at our competitive win rates across the market, including in the backyard of some of our big competitors, our competitive win rates are holding up, our discounts are holding up. So they're really executing well and taking a really strong approach to the market. So we couldn't be more pleased with what's happening in EMEA. Internationally, if you go into APJ, we had an okay quarter. We still have some work to do there. We think there's tremendous upside in the APJ market, and we will continue to add resources both on the go-to-market and continue to internationalize and localize our products so we can have a better fit in some of the emerging markets we're going after in APJ.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Carl, maybe the first one for you and then a quick one for Zane. You mentioned a couple of really interesting deals in a number of different verticals, including state and local. You talked about a FedRAMP deal. I guess maybe -- can you dimensionalize the growth of some of these verticals relative to financial services and retail hospitality, when do we think that the kind of the state local, the federal, the health and life sciences, the education verticals can start to rival that type of scale that you're seeing with FINS serve and retail and opticality? And then a quick follow-up for Zane.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. So thanks for the question, Alex. And as you know, we don't break out or share specifically or percentages on any given market segment or industry. But in the case -- this time, we did highlight our second $1 billion in annual recurring revenue business in retail and hospitality, which continues to be quite strong and growing. And we had another really solid quarter in industries as a whole and specifically in higher ed, we called out health care and financial services. In the government business, listen, we're still in the very early days of state and local government. I think there's only 15 states at this point who have decided to do a full platform replacement, which leaves 35 or 36 states up for opportunity for us going forward. And we think we have a really good solution for that market. And on the federal side, listen, we're just starting. We have FedRAMP moderate. We said we were excited to see our first customer civilian agency, do a full platform rollout on our FedRAMP Cloud. And we also said we were bringing in a new leader, right, a really seasoned leader to help us lead federal going forward. So this is an area we'll continue to lean into. We do see opportunity in federal even without having FedRAMP high on the cloud, we do have a lot of opportunity with the existing agencies, and we see that as a rich market for us going forward.\nAlex Zukin: Around the early renewal dynamic that you guys are seeing this year. Clearly, a solid benefit for Q2, 24 months description backlog, it sounds like there's also some benefit in the guide for Q3. Maybe just dimensionalize it and remind us like what's the customer activity? Is it an incentive that you're giving? Is it the macro? Like what's driving this? And like do we think about this as a future headwind? Do we think about this as an opportunity for code perming at upsell? Like what's the right way to think about this?\nZane Rowe: Alex. Yes, I'll start and then let Carl chime in as well. As you point out, we're very pleased with the RPO growth on the 24-month side this quarter was 22.7% growth. But as we pointed out for all the reasons Karl and Doug mentioned, we saw about 1.5 points of that be early renewals coming into the quarter, which is a terrific opportunity for us to interact and interface with our customers, as well as upsell them as well. So we're very pleased with the outcome in Q2. As we look to Q3, what we've done is taken a look at where our expectations are for Q3, which is included in that 21% increase as part of our guide. I'd say approximately 1 point of that as we look out to the next quarter right now is included in that 21%. So we believe that activity will continue. Again, we're thrilled with the activity. It means our customers are doubling down on us. They're leaning into that platform, and we couldn't be more pleased with that. As you point out, obviously, we've been running ahead of subscription revenue for some time on RPO. So we would expect some variability related to subscription revenue in the future, but we welcome the early renewals, and we think it's a terrific opportunity for customers to continue to buy into the platform. Carl, I'll let you add to that.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Thanks, Zane. Yes, Alex, we did have another really good quarter of selling back into our customer base. We talked about that earlier. And that is what drives a lot of the early renewals. But I want to make sure it's clear to everyone, we don't incent our teams to drive early renewals. We incent our teams to work with our customers to add additional SKUs as they look to consolidate more and more on top of the HCM or the financials platform. So the demand is being driven by our customers and then we go and we work with them in some cases, they add new SKUs. And when they do so, they actually do early renewal and they've co-term their agreements, which drives the uplift that Zane talked about in our 24-month RPO. So we're not incenting people to do it. It's customer demand. They're looking to add more and more modules. And as we continue to innovate and bring new SKUs to market, we would expect this to continue going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. I wanted to sort of extend on Brad Sills earlier question about kind of the upsell motion. It seems like you guys are having a lot of success there. Carl, when I think back to your guys' time at VMware, VMware was a machine in terms of packaging and mechanisms for selling more solution into existing customers, and there's a huge kind of successful part of that business? Are there sort of learnings or sort of mechanisms or improvements that you guys can make in that hub cell motion that you could bring on board that could turbocharge this upsell effort even further from what we've been seeing thus far?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, I'll take that, and thanks for the question, Keith. I hope you're well. Listen, the teams are doing really good already selling back into the customer base. I think it has to do with the motion that Doug and Patrick are driving with two different, if you will, sales forces, one selling only to customer base and the other selling net new. And because we have that focus on customer-based sales, I think the teams are driving these new SKUs back into our customers. Specifically as it relates, can we do things differently. Potentially -- we are looking at different ways to price and package our products in the future to make it easier and more consumable for our customers and make it easier for our sales reps to sell -- but right now, we don't have any, if you will, new plays that we're running. I think the team is executing well. Our customers clearly see the value of the additional SKUs that we have in the market. and clearly see a total cost of ownership play by consolidating on top of our platform. So I don't think you'll see any short-term change here, Keith. But we're always looking for ways to innovate on go-to-market and one of them would be through some type of pricing and packaging in the future.\nDoug Robinson: Keith, I would just add, we continue to obviously invest in this area. It's one of tremendous opportunity for us. and we spend a fair amount of time looking at it and thinking about what's the next best opportunity for the customer to recognize value and, of course, in turn for us to do the same. So it's an area that we continue to see good progress on.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. It‚Äôs very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Carl, earlier in the year, you unveiled a new partner referral program. Maybe too early to see the fruits of this new program, but curious if what you're seeing and ultimately what over the next six to nine months with this partner program?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, sure. Thanks, Brent. Good to hear from you. We did launch a new partner program. There's many facets to it. including technology arrangements and collaboration on the technology front, including co-sell, including resell. And also, we rolled out a referral program. And I will say we're seeing early signs of the customers really leaning into this new program. And they're also getting value because they're innovating on top of Workday, leveraging things like Extend to expand their market opportunity with us as well. So the resell program, that's Phase 2, but the co-sell and referral program has kicked off, and we're seeing a nice uplift in referrals from our partners on a global basis. Another thing we did is we launched a partnership, if you recall, Brent, with AWS, and we're selling to the marketplace. And we have seen a number of opportunities in Q2 that were driven from that partnership with AWS as people are looking to burn down the credits they have with AWS today. So Overall, we're very excited about the partner program. We had a big partner conference just last month. We had over 3,000 people joining us at our Altitude conference where we spent more time articulating our new program. and sharing with them how they can both monetize the Workday platform to sell more services and innovative solutions and also help us drive net new outcomes and get paid for it.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Welcome aboard Zane, I'll direct this one to you. As you just alluded to, the gap between the 24-month backlog and the sub revs growth has historically been pretty narrow, but it's widened out a lot in recent quarters to 3 to 4 points. I'm just curious -- why is that? And over what time frame do you think that gap will close? Maybe it's partly due to the early renewals you mentioned, but maybe there are other factors. Thanks for unpacking that for us.\nZane Rowe: Yes, of course, Karl, great to hear from you. As we mentioned, we're really pleased with the program we have behind that and the additional backlog and the performance we've seen on RPO has even exceeded our expectations over the last number of quarters. And it's driven by a number of variables. I think both Carl and Doug talked about the relationship with the customer, as well as our opportunity to expand those SKUs and that relevance with our customers. So we're pleased with the performance there. Now some of the variability we talked about education and gov we tend to see longer duration with those contracts. So that will have a natural extension. And in many cases, especially if you look at the top line growth of backlog and RPO we see significant increases driven by that mix shift. And then the other dynamic is, of course, the early renewal that we talked about, where it's another opportunity to engage with the customer to go deeper into the platform, as well as sell more of our SKUs. So it's -- as I pointed out in the third quarter, we feel like the second quarter was higher, at least our current expectations at the second quarter and the activity we saw there would be higher than what we see in the third quarter. Part of it is also Doug's team and just where they spend their energy, and we've obviously leading up to a seasonally strong fourth quarter. So we like the motion. We encourage the motion. It's an opportunity for us to lean in and have a longer and more durable relationship with our customer base. And we believe you'll see that reflected in the numbers. But to your point, it may create a little bit of variability if you looked at backlog and the variance between backlog and subscription revenue. But we're solely focused on driving continued growth in the business and particularly focused on that subscription -- that long-term subscription revenue line. Hopefully, that helps.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes, it does Zane. Thank you.\nZane Rowe: Great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thanks very much for taking my question. There's a lot of goodness in the results and the message. So I'll echo my welcome to Zane and congrats to you all. My question actually for you, Zane, is in your comments, you've said that Workday plans on maintaining a disciplined approach of investing in long-term growth while expanding margins, which I think is music to everyone's ears. But can you expand on what that means to you? And if there's any sort of framework or even rule of thumb that we should consider in the years ahead? Thanks.\nZane Rowe: Yes, it's good to hear from you. I'd say, generally, we're at a unique opportunity here at the company to do exactly that, which is to lean in and to make smart investments Carl has highlighted a number of those, whether it's partners, whether it's international defense product. We're at a point where I think this is an opportunity to really lean in on our TAM opportunity and that growth that we can see across the platform. So from the finance side, I think we benefit because we can make thoughtful investments and help the business grow both on the product side. Obviously, we talk about AI ML and the tremendous opportunity we have there. But then also on the go-to-market side, when I look at that balance between 75% domestic and 25% international, I just think it's ripe with opportunity to grow on the international side, but do it in a thoughtful way, as Carl alluded to, on the EMEA side, with an uncertain backdrop, we've seen great opportunities there, and we've seen good growth there. So I'm just pleased when I look at the opportunity to be here to leverage the finance side and to lean in on where we make these investments -- and then we continue to see top line growth. And as I just mentioned on the RPO side, we can see significant RPO growth, but along with that, we have investments in interesting areas that create longer-term revenue growth and subscription revenue growth as well around the globe. Carl, that you add a few.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. No, I think you said it well, Zane. We continue to invest on the go-to-market side, but I want to make sure everyone knows we're investing heavily on the product and technology front as well. And Neil's leading that charge with [Indiscernible] -- we continue to invest to drive innovation here at Workday, and we're leaning into the AI ML opportunity. which we think will bear fruit in the future. The other thing to think about is how do we get operating leverage from AI and ML internally. We think by using these technologies, we can actually drive better operating margin, which allows us to reinvest in go-to-market and products in the future. So there is kind of a flywheel effect we can get from the benefit of AI and ML.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, stuff. Thanks so much guys.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks, congrats from me as well on the results. You're getting a number of questions on the backlog metrics, but it's really the consistency of those metrics that continues to impress. You're guiding for low-20s growth again next quarter. So maybe you can expand on just what's helping sustain such a consistent growth profile in an inconsistent environment? And then going back to the international side, there were some encouraging commentary around EMEA, but the growth rate there still lagging a bit. So just wondering if there are signs you're seeing that can help the growth rate there and maybe pick back up and take some of the load off of the U.S. strength you're seeing? Thanks.\nZane Rowe: Sure. Yes, I'll start and then hand over to Carl. As we point out with backlog it's really that relationship with the customer and the diversity of the business and the contract lengths that have helped support that. And it's been Doug's team interacting, interfacing with those customers. and leaning in more on the platform. And that's what you see reflected in those RPO numbers. Our success that we've seen on the renewals has clearly helped our customers engage more, create more uplift as well as extend the duration of our relationship with them. So I think it's that compounding effect. That you've seen over the last number of quarters. And again, I would highlight that not only do we lean in there, but we wouldn't always expect as we look out for the remainder of the year or even into next year, it's not that we're pushing the backlog. We're focused on subscription revenue and continued subscription revenue growth -- and the backlog just happens to be in that big RPO increase just happens to be a byproduct of the interaction and interface that we have with those customers in the long-term relationship that we've developed with them. Carl, that you maybe give a little bit more detail.\nCarl Eschenbach: I think you're asking specifically on the first question about how do we continue to do this. And I think it's just the strength of the platform we have. And I think with some headwinds in the market that everyone continues to face, people are looking to do more with less. And by doing so, they're looking for a total cost of ownership play. And I think we provide that both on the HCM side and the financials as people consolidate what I said earlier, from best-of-breed to best of suite. And it's also driving a different level of employee experience. We're helping drive productivity gains for our customers. We're helping them upskill and rescale the folks. We're delivering a new level of employee experience. And by doing all of those, people just continue to put more and more on top of our platform. And even if it is our own SKU, they're leveraging things like extend to build other solutions on top of the Workday platform. So I think this motion of selling back into the base is going to continue as people consolidate more and more on top of us. As it relates to the international growth, again, we're highlighting we saw really good performance out of our team in EMEA, specifically and we're encouraged by both the consistency and predictability of their performance and the strong pipeline that we're building over there as we head into the second-half of the year. Let me say, though, on the flip side, if I can, Michael, right? Our U.S. team just continues to drive really solid performance as well, and they're outperforming in a number of key areas like large enterprise and across some of those industries that we spoke about today. Our education business, health care and financials. So we're aiming to keep driving, right, our U.S. business and watching them continue to perform and outperform and at the same time, try to drive international growth. And it's always important to remember, the international growth from bookings doesn't actually get shown in -- right in the same quarter, you'll see it in the out quarters as we look to continue to drive that growth. We'll see a slight shift over the coming years from 75-25 to something that we get more impact and more performance from the international teams.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you guys, so much for taking my question. Nice to see continued strength and resilience in the business. I want to go back to talking about generative AI and your opportunity there. Clearly, a big opportunity to leverage the data you have and use it to make the product and platform better. But I want to talk about the opportunity to maybe utilize generative AI, both to accelerate migrations from legacy on-premise solutions in terms of making it easier for custom applications to migrate, as well as making it easier for that data to transform and maintain -- transfer and maintain data fidelity? And maybe at the same time, even on your end, utilize generative AI to reduce the services attach rate and bring down that services mix a little bit over time. Any way you could help me kind of understand the way you can utilize it on that would be very helpful? Thank you so much.\nDoug Robinson: Yes. On the first part, we are definitely looking at generative AI to do a better job of data transfer and transformation from legacy systems. And I think over time, it will be increasingly automated with AI. So that's already in motion. On the second one, it's definitely something we're exploring and how we bring AI into our services organization to speed up implementations. Stay tuned on that part. We're very focused on the products that we deliver to our customers. And one thing to think about is actually how we build AI into the products to make them easier to implement. But that's a work in progress at this point. It's a great question.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. I'll now turn it over to Mr. Eschenbach for final comments.\nCarl Eschenbach: Thank you, operator, and thank you for everyone joining today's call. And a special thanks to our workmates customers and partners around the globe that continue to fuel Workday's success. Q2 was another solid quarter, highlighted by the diversity and mission critical nature of our business. We have an exciting opportunity ahead, and we are all well positioned as we think about the second-half of the year and beyond. I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Rising Conference and Financial Analyst Day in San Francisco. With that, I will hand the call back over to the operator to close today's call. And I hope everyone has a great evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to one. With that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJustin Furby: Thank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our Co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our second quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on July 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\nAneel Bhusri: Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. I'm pleased to share that Workday reported strong Q1 results and once again outperformed against our key operating metrics, which include a subscription revenue growth of 20% for the quarter. While the macro environment continues to be unpredictable, we remain positive about our future growth prospects for a couple of reasons. First, we got the year off to a strong start and have built a healthy pipeline of opportunities, which gives us better visibility into the rest of fiscal '24. And second, we're seeing the value proposition of the full Workday platform combined with our unique approach to artificial intelligence and machine learning, continue to gain momentum as more and more organizations across geographies and industries put their trust in us to help them drive the future of work. When it comes to AI and ML, we think about implementing differently than any other enterprise software company in the world. And we've been at it for nearly a decade, while many of our competitors are scrambling to catch up. We approach AI and ML with a heavy emphasis on being human-centric, using these capabilities to augment people in organizations to make them more productive, better informed to make decisions, and to help them reduce business risk. Several things set us apart. One, AI and ML are embedded into the very core of our platform, allowing us to rapidly deliver and sustain new ML infused capabilities into our products to drive more business value for our customers. Two, we have the quantity and quality of data that further differentiates us, meaning that we not only have access to an enormous amount of data due to the more than 60 million users representing more than 600 billion transactions over the last year. But we also have a unified data model that allows us to build and train models in a way our competitors simply cannot replicate. And three, we firmly believe that to deliver on the possibilities it offers AI and ML must be leveraged in a trustworthy, unethical way. Workday has always been a trusted partner to help companies keep their most critical assets, their people and money, safe, secure and private. This approach becomes even more essential when leveraging AI and ML. As you know generative AI is driving the AI and ML discussion right now. Despite the recent hype around large language models, Workday has been delivering AI and ML including LLMs for several years. We believe we need to look past the hype cycle and identify the real ways our customers can extract business value from LLMs. Today we're using generative AI tools behind the scenes to help power products like Workday search and skills cloud, while exploring a variety of generative AI use cases for our customers. For example, we're looking at many content generation use cases within our Workday talent management, recruiting, financial management, and core HCM applications. Additionally, for years, we have taken a leading role in AI focused policy discussions at the federal state and local level in the U.S., while partnering with the European Union and other governments around the world to provide thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI. Simply put, we believe AI technology should be regulated. This is an area that you will continue to hear more from us in future quarters, and I look forward to sharing updates about how Workday is helping to drive AI policy globally. Moving to our core set of applications, we continued our investment in Workday Peakon Employee Voice by recently unveiling semantic search capabilities, which leverages AI to analyze millions of employee comments and present the most meaningful insights. While manual keyword searches take hours or days, semantic search can analyze employee comments in seconds to quickly provide leaders with the insights they need to address emerging workplace trends. Employee engagement is one of the biggest hot buttons for CEOs today, and we're continuing to see more organizations turn to Peakon to help them stay on top of and address employee sentiment. In fact, Peakon hit a significant milestone in Q1 as it surpassed more than 500 million total survey responses, and 70 million written comments, providing us with one of the world's largest standardized datasets on employee sentiment. For the office of the CFO, we recently unveiled predictive forecaster, a capability within Workday adaptive planning, that creates ML-based forecasts with the ability to add additional regressors and datasets. The feature which is in limited availability today, supports our next evolution of Workday adaptive planning to produce increasingly predictive plans and enhance insights to help organizations more effectively navigate today's business landscape. Another important innovation focus area for us is to be more open and connected. Whether that's by providing an open and extensible platform or by working closely with our partners to deliver added value to our customers. For our Workday platform, we're continuing to deliver tools and capabilities that simplify and enhance application development with Workday Extend. For example, we introduced our first set of ML APIs in Q1 to enable our Extend customers to build extensions that leverage ML. We also released low code no code development functionality with App Builder. enabling developers to create apps with Extend via a simple drag and drop user interface. And we built on our decade plus partnership with AWS to create a native integration from Extend to AWS. With this integration, developers can easily and securely leverage AWS services in their Extend applications. The integration is in early access with GA to follow later this year. Extend which surpassed 500 customers in Q1 continues to be a major differentiator for us with the office of the CIO. Additionally, we held Workday DevCon, our third annual developers conference earlier this month. In person attendance for this year's event grew by nearly 200% over last year, which is a testament to the excitement we're seeing from our customers and partners to build on top of the Workday platform, not only with Extend, but with Prism, Adaptive Planning, Journeys and Integrations. And on the partner front, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Alight to deliver an integrated payroll experience to customers across six key regions for us in Europe, Benelux, Germany, Italy, the Nordics, Spain and Switzerland. As you know Workday's core values are foundational to everything we do, and guide the decisions we make. In recognition of our efforts to always strive to do what's right. I'm pleased to share that Workday for the third consecutive year, was named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere. Additionally, we continued our commitment to sustainability by joining Frontier, and advanced market commitment to accelerate carbon removal. Finally, I want to note an organizational change that we will be making. After nearly nine years with Workday, Barbara Larson, our current CFO is stepping away to spend more time with her family. During her time with Workday, Barbara has served in several senior leadership roles across our finance and product organizations, has played an integral role in shaping Workday into the company we are today. I'm extremely grateful for her friendship and for the countless contributions she has made to the company. And I wish her nothing but the best in her next endeavor. With Barbara leaving, I'm pleased to announce that Zane Rowe will be joining Workday as our new CFO. Zane comes to us from VMware, where he was CFO since 2016. And before that held CFO roles at EMC and United Airlines. Carl and Zane worked together at VMware, so I let Carl share more in a minute on what Zane's addition to our leadership team will mean for Workday. In closing, we once again delivered a strong quarter and feel good about our growth prospects throughout the rest of fiscal year '24, despite what will continue to be a challenging macro and economic environment. Innovation is core to who we are and fuels our continuing focus on infusing differentiative AI and ML across our entire product portfolio. Doing that will enable us to continue to serve as the digital backbone for organizations who want to thrive in today's changing world of work. With that, I'll turn it over to our Co-CEO and my good friend, Carl Eschenbach to share our go-to-market highlights from the quarter. Carl, over to you?\nCarl Eschenbach: Thanks, Aneel. And thank you everyone for joining today. I want to start by offering my sincere thanks to Barbara for all she has done for Workday in her nearly nine years here. As a Board Member and now as Co-CEO, I've had the opportunity to watch her grow and help drive Workday forward across her many leadership roles. Without question, Workday is a better company because of her. We will miss her and we wish her well. As we searched for a leader to take over as CFO [indiscernible] and I cannot think of a better person than Zane Rowe. I had the privilege of working alongside him at VMware, and I believe he is one of the finest executives and CFOs in all of enterprise software. As we embark upon the next phase of our growth journey, Zane is the perfect person to guide us on our path of driving durable long-term growth and margin expansion. We are thrilled to welcome Zane to the team and expect a seamless transition over the next couple of months. Ninety days ago at our global sales kickoff, we challenged our teams to deliver a strong start for FY '24. I'm proud to say that our workmates met that goal driving growth across key geographies, industries and solutions, leading to strong new ACB growth in Q1. Because of their efforts, we are well positioned as we head into Q2, despite a challenging macro environment, which continues to cause customer uncertainty, increased scrutiny, and in some cases, lightning sales cycles. I joined workday as Co-CEO six months ago. And while I was excited about the possibilities then, I am even more excited now. Sharing the Co-CEO role with Aneel couldn't be going any better. Working alongside him, I've had the chance to witness the power of Aneel 30 years of product experience, which is unmatched in our industry. Our complementary skills make a tremendous partnership. I've also spent a lot of time over the last few months meeting with our employees, customers and partners around the world. These visits have shown me the energy and innovation across the Workday community firsthand. They reinforced my belief that Workday has the potential to be one of the most enduring software businesses of our time. There are two key themes I keep hearing that sets us apart. The first is that Workday is mission critical. Workday is the intelligent digital backbone for enterprises who are looking to consolidate their technology footprint and move from best-of-breed applications to best-in-suite or best-in-platform. Enterprises are clearly looking to benefit from the reduced total cost of ownership and a rapid pace of innovation that Workday delivers. Second, as Aneel mentioned, Workday's approach to AI and ML is a clear differentiator for us. With over 60 million users all on a unified data model. We are uniquely positioned to be the secure steady hand to support our customers through this tectonic technology shift, same as we did with Cloud. Turning to highlights for the quarter, I would like to focus on 5 key areas; land, expand, global, industries and partners. Our land motion with net new customers remains the primary driver of our growth. We had a strong performance landing new customers across our key buying centers, geographies and industries in Q1 and continue to see significant runway. In HCM, where we are the clear market leader, we saw sustained momentum with several new customer wins, including Dollar Tree, Interpublic Group, Johor Corporation and McLean Company, along with notable HCM go-lives, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, J. Crew and Lexmark International. Increasingly, customers are looking to leverage the full power of Workday by purchasing both HCM and financial management. New full platform wins in Q1 include IBEX Global Solutions, Pima County, The Rio and Stephens Transport. We also had several core Fins go-live, including Whole Foods, Vanderbilt University Medical Center; and Extendicare, which went live on both Financials and HCM. Another way that we strategically bring new customers into the Workday community is through our planning-first motion, which drove healthy growth and had important wins in every major region this quarter, including Leonardo Hotels, LeoVegas and a significant expansion of our agreement with ExxonMobil. Planning is an important first step on our customers' digital transformation journey. And once they are a Workday customer, we can partner with them to realize the full benefits of our platform. Several companies expanded from Planning first to full platform in Q1, including DJE Holdings and The Nature Conservancy. Given this success, along with momentum, we are seeing within the office of the CFO, we are adding significant sales capacity this year focused on selling Fins. And while this is early, we are optimistic about the initial pipeline momentum from these resources. Customers are increasingly leaning into Workday as their trusted platform across the board. This was reflected in strong renewals and healthy expansion activity across our installed base in Q1. Wins include Brown & Brown, IU Group, Nissan and Racetrack, to name a few. We are seeing expand to momentum across our product portfolio, including solutions that deliver faster time to value for customers such as Peakon, Planning, Health and Talent Optimization. This momentum is helping our sales teams create and close a healthy amount of pipeline all in the same quarter. Global growth continues to be a massive untapped opportunity for us. We drove strong execution across a number of our major geographies this quarter, yet less than 5% of our TAM is penetrated. In the U.S., we saw strong traction, particularly within large enterprise. In EMEA, we're seeing early signs that our new leadership team is coming together with healthy growth across key markets, including Germany, Switzerland and the Nordics; and wins, including Equinor ASA and Clyde & Co. In APJ, Australia was a highlight with wins including Insignia Financial and the Australian arm of Tokio Marine. Momentum is also clearly building within our investment in native payroll in the Australian market. While we still have work to do in APJ to capture the full market potential, after spending time in the region in Q1, the executive team and I continue to see a lot of opportunity. Next, I want to highlight our industry-first approach, which is a critical part of winning the offices of the CFO and CHRO within our core services-based industries. In higher education, for example, we have led the market over the last 3 years in cloud-native HCM, financial and student systems according to the Tambellini Group. We saw continued momentum in Q1 with notable wins, including a Fins expansion at Northeastern University and new platform wins at the University of Richmond and Loyola University of Maryland. In the professional services industry, the key wins I mentioned earlier include deals at DJE Holdings, IBEX and Interpublic Group. In financial services, we had several wins and expansions, including Absa Bank, Fannie Mae and First American. In state and local government, we followed up a strong Q4 with another quarter of healthy growth. And in health care, we were pleased to be named the top-performing cloud ERP solution by Class Research. And we had important Q1 wins, including a significant expansion at Stanford Health Care. Our ability to accelerate our momentum in these industries and across our business depends on our ability to maintain a vibrant and engaged partner ecosystem. While our partner ecosystem has always been critical to our success, we are shifting even more deployments to our partners. And in return, we are looking to work with our partners in increasingly strategic ways to drive more co-innovation and greater lead generation for the Workday. As part of that effort, we rolled out our new partner referral program in May, which puts clear incentives in place for our ecosystem to drive lead generation. In addition, following our go-to-market partnership with AWS we announced last quarter, I'm pleased to share that we had our first AWS private marketplace transaction during Q1. And as Aneel mentioned, the recently announced payroll partnership with Alight expands our global payroll coverage. In closing, we're off to a great start in FY '24 with strong new business bookings, healthy pipelines and continued progress towards our strategic growth initiatives. And while the macro remains uncertain, we are positioning the business to return to 20%-plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves and laying the foundation for driving durable growth and margin expansion for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Barbara. Barbara, over to you.\nBarbara Larson: Thanks, Carl. I appreciate the kind words. It's been such a pleasure to work and grow alongside you, Aneel and this entire organization these last 9 years. But after much thought, I know this is the right time for me to step back and focus on my family. And I can't think of a better person to pass the CFO reins to than Zane. He's a remarkable leader, an incredible person and culture fit and the right person to take Workday on the next phase of its incredible growth journey. I look forward to working with him over the next couple of months to ensure a seamless transition. As Aneel and Carl mentioned, we had a strong start to the year driven by solid execution and durable demand across our solutions as organizations continue their finance and HR modernization journey. Subscription revenue in Q1 was $1.53 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Professional services revenue in the quarter was $156 million. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $420 million in Q1, representing 25% of total revenue. Twenty-four-month subscription revenue backlog was $9.79 billion, up 23% at the end of Q1, resulting from strong new ACV bookings and renewals with growth in net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. As Carl mentioned, we saw significant customer base expansion activity in the quarter. Many of the customers that expanded their strategic footprint elected to co-term and renew their existing contracts ahead of schedule. These early renewals in the quarter added roughly 1 percentage point to both 24-month and total backlog growth. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q1 was $16.65 billion, up 32%. In addition to the benefit from early renewals, we continue to see an increased average contract duration on both new deals and renewals, causing total backlog to grow significantly faster than 24-month backlog. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $396 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.5%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue upside, a slower-than-anticipated ramp in hiring and the timing of certain expenses. Q1 operating cash flow was $277 million. As we discussed last quarter, the year-over-year decline was driven by the first full year payout of our performance-based cash bonus program, a $55 million interest payment on our debt and payments associated with our January workforce realignment. We ended the first quarter with more than 17,800 global workmates. We continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology, but we continue to plan for fewer head count additions in FY '24 as compared to FY '23. Overall, we're very proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q1, and we are focused on maintaining our momentum as we enter Q2. Now turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum of our business while also balancing what remains an uncertain macro environment. Following a strong Q1, we are raising the low end of our FY '24 subscription revenue guidance, resulting in a new range of $6.550 billion to $6.575 billion, an 18% year-over-year growth. We continue to view this guidance as prudent in the context of the environment. We expect Q2 subscription revenue to be $1.611 billion to $1.613 billion, representing 18% year-over-year growth. Additionally, we continue to expect sequential subscription revenue growth in Q3 of approximately 4%. We are maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of $630 million to $650 million. As Carl mentioned, we are strategically shifting more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $160 million. We expect the 24-month backlog to increase approximately 20% year-over-year in Q2. We continue to expect FY '24 a non-GAAP operating margin of 23% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach to invest in long-term growth opportunities, while at the same time delivering healthy margin expansion. For Q2, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2. GAAP operating margins for both the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. We expect to achieve GAAP profitability on an operating income basis beginning in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year as we continue to drive margin expansion and reduce stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. To align our compensation plan with our focus on speed of execution and results, we recently modified our cash bonus program from an annual to a semiannual payout structure, beginning with our FY '24 bonus plan. We expect to make the first semiannual payment in Q3 of this year, resulting in an additional bonus payment in FY '24 versus our initial expectations. As a result, we now expect FY '24 operating cash flow of $1.95 billion, growth of 18% year-over-year. In addition, we are lowering our guidance for FY '24 capital expenditures to approximately $300 million driven by normalization we are seeing within our supply chain. We have $425 million in the remaining authorization under our buyback program and expect to resume buying back shares in Q2 after our trading window opens. And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work as we move through FY '24 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Considering that it's a Q1 and macro headwinds are persistent, this is a significant outperformance in the backlog. So congratulations to the team Workday. One quick one for Aneel. With generative AI, what is your view on how Workday can potentially get paid? Is it to a new SKU or improvement in ARPU? And if I can slip one for Carl, any update on the net new business back-to-the-base initiative and how that's powering through these results would be useful. Thank you so much.\nAneel Bhusri: So I think touch the part about ChatGPT and then or generative AI, and then what was the follow-on to that?\nKash Rangan: How can you monetize it, Aneel, in terms of a new SKU or an ability to charge more for the productivity improvement that you can offer to your customers?\nAneel Bhusri: Yes. I think in general; AI and ML are technologies that all customers should expect to be embedded in their products. The way we've thought about it is using it to enable products that couldn't have existed before. We announced some of them as new SKUs, but our big ones so far have been Skills Cloud. That just couldn't exist without AI/ML. You could say the same about Talent Optimization. As it relates to generative AI, by the way, those are based on generative AI maybe not ChatGPT, but generative AI. And Skills Cloud is a great example of a large language model as well. There's other SKUs coming down the road. There's content generation. You could think about the one that everybody talks about, performance reviews as an example. There are ways to monetize it, but we want to make sure it's a brand-new product that couldn't be built without it. And I would just say stay tuned. You'll see us start rolling things out, but we're doing things around generative AI very carefully to make sure that we follow our path on ethics and security and doing it the right way.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Kash, as it relates to the net new business, as you can see, we had a really strong start to the year here in Q1, and that includes our net new business or our new ACV business. And it was across all industries. It wasn't specific to one. It was across all industries. It was across all market segments. And geographically, we saw strong performance both in the U.S. and in EMEA as well. So our net new business is the lifeline of Workday. It gives us the customer installed base to sell back into. And we saw a strong performance in Q1, and that was reflected in our guide for both Q2 and the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Congrats on the great consistency. And Barbara, best wishes, and thank you for everything. Carl and Aneel, in this environment, are you better off spending the next incremental dollar on financials or on products that help to navigating this challenging labor market, like recruiting and skills cloud and talent marketplace. I'm just wondering where you see stronger prioritization and willingness to buy. And then, you did mention a significant expansion with ExxonMobil. I'm a little surprised because I recall that as a very large planning deal just announced last summer. Can you just clarify why the expansion is so rapid there?\nAneel Bhusri: On the R&D side, they're long-term investments. And I feel very comfortable that they're all fully funded. I think in this environment, it's more of a question on how you allocate go-to-market resources. And that's really up to Carl. So Carl, how would you think about that?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Sure. So we saw a really solid performance in financials this quarter. And as we talked about last quarter, we were doubling down on go-to-market around financials and hiring a significant number of quota-carrying capacity reps. And we're going to continue to do that because of the pipeline that we saw build specifically around financials. We also called out in our prepared remarks that we continue to see a lot of momentum in our land business, specifically around planning. We land customers with planning, and then they come right back in and buy both. Financials, obviously, but we're also seeing people buy HCM on the back of a planning land because of workforce planning. In the example of Exxon, we only had a portion of their business for Planning, and they expanded it much more broadly across their entire business because they saw the value that they got from that platform that they started to use a year ago. So again, planning is a good lead-in for us, and we'll continue to invest in go-to-market around financials because of both the strength of financials and the planning land business we see today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Very nice quarter. I wanted to ask a question really about the macro environment and what you're seeing out there. You referred to it as still uneven. But like the idea of customers co-terming and sort of pulling forward contracting seems a little bit more aggressive than what we saw, like this time last year when customers were delaying deals and shifting it out. So one, should we take that as any indication on kind of the overall macro environment? And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about that state of Iowa contract that was in the news that got canceled. Did that have any impact on the quarter in terms of RPO or bookings or is that already out of there? Thank you.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Thanks, Keith, for the question. I think it's consistent from what we described last quarter. There's an uncertain environment out there which, in some cases, caused customer uncertainty, increased scrutiny. We're seeing the CFO be involved in a lot more deals. And in some cases, we're even seeing lengthening of sales cycles, but that's specific, if you will, more to net new opportunities. And even if they get pushed out, they don't go away. They just push out by a quarter or 2. That being said, we couldn't be more proud of how we executed in Q1 with this backdrop. And one of the reasons we think that's the case is because companies continue to prioritize both HCM and financial transformations to support two of their most critical assets: their people and their money. And in an environment like this, we're starting to see our value proposition actually only become that much stronger. The reason for that is we think our platform is a consolidation play. And as people consolidate more on to a specific platform, there's a total cost of ownership benefit that they get. And if you think about the headwinds most of our customers are facing specific to the HCM platform, they need to drive two things, they need to drive productivity gains and they also need to make sure their employee experience is at the highest level, and that's exactly what we do on the HCM side. On the financial side, the value proposition also is resonating in this environment, why? Because finance role has continued to change in an environment like we're playing in today. They have to be agile and nimble. They have to be able to do forecast, and they have to make quick [indiscernible]. And we just see this as another example where our platform play on the financials only get that much stronger. So I think overall, we're not immune to the environment that's out there, but our value proposition is resonating more than ever in a market like we're dealing with today.\nBarbara Larson: And then, Keith, this is Barbara on Iowa. We don't provide customer-specific revenue or backlog disclosures but do keep in mind that no single customer is material to our business.\nDoug Robinson: Keith, Doug Robinson here. I'd just say that the storyline for me of the quarter is the diversity of the business. And so you talk about the macro, it's sort of the core of your question. And there's enough diversity in that business that we're not seeing where there are pockets of weakness, we have lots of diverse lines of business where we do see industry a lot of strength. And specific about like the early renewal comment, I think that's just a function of not a focus or any specific sales play that's being run, but I do think it's a function of we're getting a larger percentage of our revenue from our existing customer base doubling down and back to rationalizing a number of suppliers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Congrats on the strong start and, Barbara, best of luck going forward. Aneel, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the unified data model and then the explosion of interest around AI. You guys, as you mentioned, have been investing in AI for a while. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of an advantage the unified data model is, as you bring in more generative AI into the product suite versus if you didn't have that? And I was just curious do customers recognize this, meaning when they're making a bet on your long-term product portfolio, do they realize the benefits of this model even more so as we start talking about AI in a bigger way? Thanks.\nAneel Bhusri: Well, I think it's a great question. I think it's our job to explain to them the benefits of the unified data model, and it's a huge advantage, right? We have a data model that we can run huge algorithms against that are not just all of HR, but it's all of HR and finance. And if you wanted to bring in third-party data, we can bring that in through Prism Analytics. If you think about a company that's been built through acquisition, the first thing they need to do is figure out how to get all the data and probably have to dump it into a data mart where you lose a lot of intelligence along the way, kind of lose the data model alongside. So it's huge. But the other part that's huge for us is the amount of data we have in a normalized multi-tenant fashion. We have over 60 million employees in the system and hundreds of billions of transactions every year. We have a huge advantage on the data being in a way that makes it easy to run algorithms against, where I just think for almost everybody else, it's so hard just to get the data all in one place and then they don't have the data sets that we have.\nCarl Eschenbach: I would say, too, from a sales perspective, we see it now becoming part of the buying criteria and part of the decision-making, whereas a year ago, there wasn't perhaps the customer pushing it so much as the sales teams and the consulting teams trying to demonstrate the value of it and shine a spotlight on it. Even within customer base now, we've always done, as Aneel mentioned before, predictions and recommendations based off of AI and ML, and customers have been using that for years. And there's now set an interest in understanding how we go about doing that in deeper detail.\nAneel Bhusri: And one other piece architecturally, a lot of companies are approaching AI and ML as something brand new, so they're trying to attach AI and ML technologies to the applications. Our applications have that in their foundation through the technology set or the tool set. And that goes back really to 2014. We've always looked to the consumer Internet as a guiding light for where new technologies are first born, and then we apply them in a secure way, in a way that protects data privacy. So we've been at it for almost a decade now honing in. And I think ChatGPT, and conversational AI is an important next step, but we have all the foundational elements. And I would not forget about the value of more traditional AI and ML techniques because we haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg about what companies can do to make their businesses better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Aneel and Carl, financial services, I believe, is one of your largest verticals. And many are curious ultimately what you saw post March. Have you seen any change in terms of appetite there? I'd just love to get your thoughts on the overall vertical.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Brent. Yes, it is one of our larger verticals. In fact, a few quarters ago, we talked about crossing $1 billion in ARR in this vertical. So it continues to be really important to us and strategic. It's important also to note though, Brent, when we talk about the financial services industries, it's inclusive of many things, including insurance, asset managers. We have investment banks there, commercial banks and regional banks. But as a whole, we were really pleased with our performance across the financial services segment this quarter. Specifically in the U.S., in our large enterprise segment, we saw probably the best quarter out of all the things I articulated there. At the same time, the regional banks, the regional banks fall more into our medium enterprise business here in the States. And we did see a little bit of softness in that business. But I think that was to be expected considering what was going on with the banking crisis in those regional banks. But overall, we saw a really solid performance in financial services.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: My question here is on the momentum you're seeing with those expansion deals, it sounds like, from planning to fins. I know this has been an effort that's been underway for a number of years, but it really seems like you're hitting your momentum here. What would you attribute that to? Is this just planning is becoming more or less a system of record, just given the need for analytics and the development of the platform, the challenging macro that need to change for forecasting and run ad hoc forecasting? Or is this more of an emphasis on kind of selling back into the base in that particular segment? Just curious as to why you're seeing the momentum now. Thank you.\nAneel Bhusri: I'll just answer the product piece. There's no question planning is a system of record. And I think if there was any question during the pandemic, it became very clear that companies that could plan and adjust faster and better were going to do better. And so it is now clearly a core system of record. So Doug and Carl will take it from there.\nDoug Robinson: I mean I'd definitely say the product investments have helped our sales effectiveness with financial and workforce planning. But frankly, it's a simple answer, which is adding more Fins-focused sellers who wake up every day really focused on that motion and then partnering them closely with the team that lands with the planning so that there's great collaboration between setting a vision starting with Planning but setting a vision for a full platform with Workday.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. I don't have anything to add. You said it well, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: So maybe just the first one around the way that macro evolved throughout the quarter, did you feel like it was kind of -- it's still tough, but it's not getting worse? And then kind of exiting the month of May, any commentary that you would kind of compare? And then on a product point, a really interesting partnership around global payroll with Alight. As you look at customers that are increasingly wanting to consolidate functionality onto one platform, where does it make sense to partner versus -- build versus buy or partner versus buy functionality? And why was payroll, in this case global payroll, kind of the right one to partner on versus acquire?\nCarl Eschenbach: Well, let's start with your last question, and then I'll follow up on the quarter and what we're seeing. Aneel, why don't you take the payroll.\nAneel Bhusri: Yes. So we have six of our own native payrolls. They're huge investments. And when you get to Europe and the works councils in particular, every country is very different. And it's always a trade-off about building a payroll versus HR Fins functionality that can be used in every country. There are great payroll solutions out there. Alight is a good partner. Frankly, ADP has been a very good partner almost since the start of the day of the Workday. And we have a good partnership in the field with them, a good partnership in the field. And really, what we want to do is provide choices to our customers and the more that we can do with integrations that work out of the box. Frankly, what it does is it opens up market for us where companies in some of these geographies, they expect HR and payroll to come together as opposed to just HR. So when we don't have payroll, we're not able to access all that marketplace. So these are really important partnerships to us.\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes. And as it relates to the macro, the question was around whether we're seeing anything change throughout Q1 and the start of year Q2. And no, it's pretty consistent. It's very uncertain. And as I said earlier, we're clearly seeing deals go for another level or two of approval, including all the way up to the CFO office. And that hasn't changed throughout the last four months. In fact, it's pretty consistent with what we even saw at the end of last year. That being said, we're prepared for it. The teams understand this is going to happen. They're very prepared for these extra levels of approval. And I think we've navigated these choppy waters quite well. I will say, we also mentioned in Q1, we were going to be prudent with our guide both in Q1 for the full year based on the choppy waters we see out there, and that's exactly what we're seeing. And it's playing out in the guidance. And as you saw in our guide for the full year, we maintained it because of the healthy pipeline we built coming out of Q1.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Maybe this is for Doug and/or Carl. But the HCM seat expansions can be harder to come by upon renewals in an environment where your customer base isn't hiring as aggressively. But it certainly doesn't appear from these numbers that was an issue for you guys at all. But I'd love to just comment on the seat expansion dynamic you're seeing upon renewals. Thank you.\nDoug Robinson: Yes. It's a great question and one that we purposefully built into the plan. We expect it as part of this year's plan for some moderation there. And in fact, that did play out. Now the customers that did renew in the aggregate added more employees at the end of the quarter than at the time at the end of their agreement, but it did moderate just as we planned. So to us, it's playing out as we had predicted. No deviation up or down from it.\nCarl Eschenbach: The only thing I'd add there, Doug, is if you look at the head count contraction in the market, I think it's much more acute in one industry versus others, and that's in hi-tech. So in a lot of our other customers where we did have renewals come up, they did expand their head count because not everyone is reducing their head count and doing risks out there in the market. It's much more acute in hi-tech.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Bracelin: Clearly seeing good momentum here with the planning-first sales motion. I want to pivot a little bit to Extend, particularly on the heels of Workday DevCon. You're crossing over 500 Extend customers now. What are the types of applications people are building with Extend to run on Workday? And as you think about exposing AI and large language models, does that potentially accelerate the app build opportunity with Extend? Thanks.\nAneel Bhusri: Yes. I'd say most of the applications are basically, it's called Extend. They're usually apps that customers wanted to build that are either in HR or finance that are custom apps that they had before that they now want to move into the Workday environment. So it just helps them retire legacy applications and put everything in the same environment where they also get the benefit of those applications getting updated and move forward to the next version by Workday. So it's a very powerful opportunity. And exactly what you said around AI and ML is what we're doing. And if you think about the announcements, we made at DevCon, a lot of it was enabling AI and ML development. And of course, what we're doing with AWS was huge. That was probably one of the most exciting announcements we made at DevCon. Now people can natively build on top of AWS and have it represent through Extend and tie into the rest of their Workday application suite. I think Extend is still one of our best-kept secrets. And it's hard for me to see how every customer shouldn't want to have at least some presence of Extend in their Workday footprint.\nOperator: We will take two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: You're talking about a return to 20% growth, but still above that number. So congrats on that. Maybe just one on margin, you drove 200 basis points of outperformance in the quarter, still holding on to the full year guide. I know Barb mentioned some items around timing of expenses, but anything we should be mindful of in modeling out expenses for the rest of the year? And maybe, Barb, just any further comment on how you ensure there's a seamless transition given some good transition through the management team thus far? Thanks.\nBarbara Larson: Yes. Thanks for the question. You're right. We outperformed Q1 margins. Some of that was due to a slower-than-expected hiring ramp and also some timing of certain expenses. So it's really early in the year. We have a lot of strategic growth areas of the business where we're looking to invest and help sustain durable long-term growth, while also planning to deliver healthy margin expansion this year. And in terms of the transition, I'm here through the end of July and focused on making this as smooth and as seamless as possible for Zane as well as for the team. And I couldn't think of a better person to hand the reins over to. Zane is an incredible person. I've known him personally. So Workday is in good hands.\nMichael Turrin: But I will add, you will be missed Barbara.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Hynes: Congrats on the results. Maybe one on international. I don't think we've hit that yet. It sounds like you're happy with the leadership that's in place now. I think in the past, you've talked about some product gaps that need to be filled internationally. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about kind of where you are in that process and maybe in what markets you see the most opportunity to jump start international.\nAneel Bhusri: You want to go?\nCarl Eschenbach: Yes, I'll start. So yes, thanks for the question. And it is a big focus for us here. We always talk about our TAM. And we talk about half of our TAM is outside the U.S., and only 25% of our revenues this quarter come from that market. And if you look at it globally, we're only penetrated 5% of our total TAM. And a lot of that's going to come going forward from our international expansion. In Europe, specifically, last quarter, we talked about a number of new leadership changes we made, and we're starting to see really good traction in Europe. In fact, the leadership we talked about last quarter continued. Just last week, we brought in two new leaders, both in France and a new leader in the U.K., so that team has hit the ground and they're doing super well right now. A number of us in the leadership team spent time in APJ last quarter as well. And we saw a tremendous amount of opportunity there in those markets. As it relates to the product, Aneel talked earlier about Alight, an example of us expanding our partnership with them to get more payroll in market. We've built out additional data centers over the last year in Singapore, in Germany, in Australia. And I think you can expect us also to look at the ecosystem, our partners going forward to expand our presence in international markets. We just recently rolled out a referral program for our partners. So if they bring us net new opportunities, they'll get paid. We launched that and we see that across EMEA. And we're also going to do some of that in APJ. So we're really pleased with the early signs of some of the transformation we're going to in the international market and it's going to come across all functions of the business, both go-to-market, product and our ecosystem.\nAneel Bhusri: Yes. And I would just add that the payroll is the big solution for a lot of those international markets. But there are capabilities required for Japan and Korea. They have a business process where thousands of people will change jobs once a year. And it's a very unique -- it's almost like a re-recruiting process. And it's been a chicken-and-egg thing, where without the pipeline, we haven't made the investments as the pipeline is building, we're making the investments in those capabilities. Japan is a country we should be doing a lot better in, and we have some product gaps that we can fill to make it better for the sales teams.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."
