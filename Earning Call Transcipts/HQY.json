[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call to Richard Putnam. Please go ahead.\nRichard Putnam: Thank you, MJ. Hello, everyone. Happy Vernal Equinox, and welcome to HealthEquity's fourth quarter fiscal year-end and 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Richard Putnam, Investor Relations for HealthEquity, and joining me today is Jon Kessler, President and CEO; James Lucania, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dr. Steve Neeleman, Vice Chair and Founder of the Company. Before I turn the call over to Jon, I have a couple of reminders. First, a press release announcing the financial results for our full year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was issued after the market closed this afternoon. These financial results include the contributions from our wholly-owned subsidiaries and accounts they administer, but do not include any impact from BenefitWallet HSA portfolio acquisition. The press release includes definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference today. A copy of today's press release, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures and a recording of this webcast can be found on our Investor Relations website, which is ir.healthequity.com. Second, our comments and responses to your questions today reflect management's view as of today, March 19, 2024, and will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. There are many important factors relating to our business, which could affect the forward-looking statements made today. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from statements made here today. We caution against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we also encourage you to review the discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stocks as detailed in our latest annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. With that out of the way, let's turn the call over to Jon Kessler. Jon?\nJon Kessler: Hi there. Thank you, Richard. Today is also a baseball's major, in addition to being the vernal equinox, is also baseball's opening day. Should be a national holiday. The good news is you do not need the permission of Major League Baseball to reproduce or account this call. You don't need anyone's permission. You can just do it. So with that, thank you for joining us. And since we just held our Investor Day Jim and I are going keep prepared remarks and of course, Steve is here for Q&A. In fiscal '24, the team delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue at 16% and reached the $1 billion in revenue milestone. Adjusted EBITDA grew more than twice as fast at 36% and in sales, as we previously reported, new logo growth and network partner production drove a record Q4 and a strong year overall. Members and assets grew 9% and 14% respectively in fiscal '24 and the team opened 949,000 new HSAs from sales. HealthEquity ended the fiscal year with 8.7 million HSA members in total. More than 30% of HSA cash is now in enhanced rates. Investing members and invested assets grew 13% and 28%, respectively. Total HSA assets reached $25.2 billion and total accounts grew 5%, including from organic CDB net growth for the first time since the pandemic began. Now, if you weren't at our Investor Day or if you were dazzled by the mountain views, listen up. Management aims to continue strong top-line growth and competitive outperformance while doubling non-GAAP net income per share from fiscal 2024 levels over the next 3 years. To do this, we have focused capital investment on our proprietary health accounts platform and the ecosystem to which it connects us, leveraging foundations in the cloud, in data science, and in API technology to deliver remarkable experiences, to deepen partnerships, and to drive member outcomes. We call those 3Ds. We further leverage our platform through opportunistic HSA portfolio acquisitions such as BenefitWallet, the transition of which we expect to complete in Q2. This 3-year strategy will, we believe, not only build shareholder value, but also advance HealthEquity's mission, which is to save and improve lives by empowering healthcare consumers. It's important stuff. Now to Jim to detail other important stuff, which is our Q4 and fiscal '24 performance and enhanced guidance for fiscal 2025. Jim?\nJames Lucania: Thank you, Jon. First, I just want to thank all of you that joined us for our Investor Day last month hope you found it informative. I'll briefly highlight fourth quarter fiscal year GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. As always, we provide a reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures in today's press release. As a reminder, the results presented here reflect the reclassifications of our income statement we described in an 8-K filed on February 21, both for fiscal '24 and the prior year for comparison. Fourth quarter revenue increased 12% year-over-year. Service revenue was $118.6 million, down 1% year over year, reflecting the final run off of National Emergency activity. Custodial revenue grew 35% to $105.4 million in the fourth quarter. The annualized interest rate yield on HSA cash was 268 basis points for the quarter. Interchange revenue grew 6% to $38.4 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 62% in the fourth quarter this year, up from 58% in the fourth quarter last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $26.4 million or $0.30 per share on a GAAP EPS basis. Our non-GAAP net income was $55 million or $0.63 per share versus $0.37 per share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $98.8 million and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 38%, a 620 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year. For the full fiscal year of 2024, revenue was $999.6 million which Jon generously rounded up to $1 billion, up 16% compared to last year. GAAP net income was $55.7 million or $0.64 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $195.5 million or $2.25 per diluted share, up 71% and 65%, respectively, compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $369.2 million, up 36% from the prior year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 37% for this fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet. As of January 31, 2024, cash on hand was $404 million boosted by $243 million of cash flow from operations for the full fiscal year. The company had $875 million of debt outstanding net of issuance costs. We continue to have a $1 billion undrawn line of credit available. We anticipate using both cash and drawing on the line of credit over the next few months in connection with the closings of the BenefitWallet HSA portfolio acquisition. Today's fiscal '25 guidance reflects the carry forward of stronger than expected Q4 sales and efficiencies from the technology investments Jon mentioned, offset by slightly higher mix of investments versus cash in HSA assets. We expect revenue in a range between $1.14 billion and $1.16 billion. GAAP net income in a range of $73 million to $88 million or $0.83 to $0.99 per share. We expect non-GAAP net income to be between $247 million and $262 million or $2.79 and $2.96 per share based upon an estimated 89 million shares outstanding for the year. This is a big deposit towards our goal of doubling non-GAAP net income per share to our $4.50 goal by fiscal 2027. Finally, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $438 million and $458 million. Our guidance reflects an expectation for an average yield on HSA cash of approximately 300 basis points for fiscal '25. As a reminder, we base custodial yield assumptions embedded in guidance on an analysis of forward-looking market indicators such as the secured overnight financing rate and mid duration treasury forward curves. These are, of course, subject to change and not perfect predictors of future market conditions. As Jon mentioned, we ended fiscal '24 with about 30% of HSA cash in Enhance rates and expect that mix shift from basic rates to continue as over 80% of new deposits flow into enhance rates. Our guidance also includes the expected impacts of the BenefitWallet HSA portfolio acquisition anticipated to be completed in multiple tranches by the end of Q2. Cost impacts include interest expense due to an increase in the amount of variable rate debt outstanding and drawdown of corporate cash to fund the acquisition and on boarding costs beyond normal seasonal costs to serve in Q1 and Q2. We expect full run rate benefit in Q3 and beyond. We assume a non-GAAP income tax rate of approximately 25% and a diluted share count of 89 million including common share equivalents. Based on our current full year guidance, we project a GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2025 at about 28%. As we've done in recent reporting periods, our full fiscal 2025 guidance includes a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP metrics provided in the earnings release and a definition of all such items is included at the end of the earnings release. In addition, while the amortization of acquired intangible assets is being excluded from non-GAAP net income, the revenue generated from those acquired intangible assets is included. With that, we know you have a number of questions. So let's go right to our operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Jon, I might be in trouble here, because I think you guys called on me in the queue faster than I can type. When I look at the custodial rev in my model for the quarter, it looks like it was down a touch sequentially while a lot of the KPIs that underpin that. Again, I'm hoping I got a good fat finger on my model here. Could you just kind of like kind of break down what kind of like line metrics that drove the sequential decline in custodial revenue where given the company's strong performance and also the KPI was I would have expected that to be up?\nJon Kessler: Yes. So let me give a partial response and then ask Jim to lay it along. I believe, George, that one of the things that will be important for everyone this quarter to remember is that, we have, as we outlined in an 8-K around our Investor Day and then discussed at Investor Day, we've made a few changes in how we in revenue classification within the three buckets of revenue on our income statement. And I believe that what you may be looking at is a little bit of an apples to oranges as a result of that, because one of the things that we've done is, I think appropriately so given its growth is we're treating the revenue that we generate from the service of managing invested assets as what it is, which is a service. And conversely, a benefit of doing that is that now the custodial line is more purely, 2 things. It's revenue generated from yield on HSA cash and revenue generated from yield on client held funds. And so that's a big piece of what you're describing, I believe. Jim, do you want to elaborate on that or on any other factors?\nJames Lucania: Yes. No, that's precisely what it's going to be. And so you'll and for the benefit of everyone on the call, the details of the shifting components in the prior periods will be outlined in a footnote in the 10-K, which we'll hope to get on file as soon as possible in the next few days or so hopefully.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. And Jon, you got Jon and Jim, you guys detailed that, and I should have kind of remembered that as I was working my way through the model. And then I guess if I could just do a quick follow-up. The enhanced rates progress on the enhanced rates product, I guess would just love any comments that you have about like the selling season as you push forward and continued demand around that.\nJon Kessler: Yes. We well, actually, Jim, you want to comment on this?\nJames Lucania: Yes. Sorry, you broke up a little bit there, but the question was about progress of moving toward growing the enhanced rate mix.\nGeorge Hill: Yes, that was it.\nJames Lucania: Yes, yes. So that yes, I think what we've outlined, nothing has really changed in the strategy. We'll get a little bit of a more of a step function bump up in that percentage because of the upcoming BenefitWallet placements. So getting a big slug of dollars that we can more than 80% place in enhanced rates is the expectation. And then the same, the organic growth in the business is also being contributed almost 80% plus into enhanced rates. So you're going to see that number come up and we've shared our goal is in that same 3-year timeframe where we're trying to double non-GAAP net income per share. We're also trying to increase the percentage or the mix of cash, HSA cash and enhanced rates from 30% up to 60%. So will it be nice and even quarterly growth? No. But that's the objective to get from 30% to 60% in the next 3 years.\nOperator: The next question is from Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo.\nStan Berenshteyn: Maybe sticking with the enhanced rates, it looks like annuities are holding up a bit better than 5-year treasury rates. Just curious what kind of spread are you seeing over 5-year treasuries as you're locking in these enhanced rate products right now?\nJon Kessler: Jim?\nJames Lucania: Yes. Again, you also at Investor Day, we outlined our sort of average expected spread is 5-year T plus 75 basis points on average. So some a little higher, some a little lower, but these spreads don't actually change, right? When we have a partner, we sort of negotiate the formula. And so we're not shopping in the retail market each time we place these assets.\nStan Berenshteyn: And maybe for the follow-up. At the Investor Day, there was definitely some excitement over the chat-based communications that you're pushing forward with members. I'm just curious, what percentage of inbound member comps are text based now and how has that changed over same time last year?\nJon Kessler: Yes. Let me first say that I think the long-term vision is that that chat is just one mechanism for this kind of stuff. And then by long-term, I don't mean the Jetsons. I mean over our strategic horizon here. Although, I guess, now the Jetsons would be in the past. I don't know. But, so I'm going to answer your question in terms of both chat and other automated forms of handling calls. And so that number is still relatively low, in terms of true automation ignoring just IVR type stuff. But low might be, we're up to kind of 15 to 20%. And in addition, we've also, in the last couple of months here, rolled out a similar functionality for our client services center that that handles inbounds from, our clients as well as, many of our brokers that we deal with. And which I frankly did not expect would be a big hit, but has been used rather aggressively. And that number has increased from, let's say, roughly 10, roughly 1,000 basis points over the last year, so 10%. And, we're going to try and drive it farther and faster. And the keys to doing that in our view are, one, is to continue to use the technology for what it's great at, which is improving the quality of the dialogue. And the main way we do that is by continuing to train the technology on actual experiences backed with our VOC data as well as with all of the data in our existing systems. The second way that we expand this is by, as I suggested a moment ago, expanding beyond, the chat format. So, we are we actually just went live in the last couple of days here with, our, sort of first iteration, of work on the voice side. I wish, I could explain the details of it, but I can't. I do know that, it's using a wonderful product from our partner Google and who's a customer of ours and also a great partner on this work and that it leverages our existing cloud infrastructure. But so we think this number can continue to grow and the results in our view can be three things. One is obviously lower cost, but the second is not only a better experience for our members and clients, but actually a better experience for our agents who the agents that are part of this, ultimately, while it obviously reduces the total number, the agents who are there can be better paid and really use their skills. And then lastly, looked at from the perspective of our partner ecosystem, I think we mentioned this on the call at Investor Day, there are opportunities for both customization and personalization of messaging with items that are of interest to our partners. And that can be as simple as branding, but sometimes, but I think more importantly, you can get to areas like doing more personalization of what you're talking about than any human could ever do. And so, I feel great about the fact that we kind of stepped out on this a little bit before there was a buzzword called AI or truthfully or generative AI at least or at least before I even knew it was generative AI. But, we're in a great spot and we're leveraging our partners at Microsoft on the infrastructure side and then obviously with this new bit on the application side of Google and doing some really neat stuff.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies.\nGlen Santangelo : Listen, obviously, a lot of good news to talk about on the custodial revenue side, but I was hoping we could maybe dig in a little bit to the service and interchange revenues. With service revenues being down a little bit relative to the account growth that you had last year, I'm kind of curious if you could talk about the pricing environment in terms of what you saw, this selling season. Then on the interchange side, I don't know if there's anything related to change health care and that issue that may have impacted the quarter? And I'll stop there.\nJon Kessler: Jim, why don't you hit the first part of Glen's question and I'll hit the second part.\nJames Lucania: Yes. So on the service side, what you're seeing is a couple of things. So yes, certainly, the market competition remains the same, right? Nothing has changed there. So we face competition on large market RFPs, and we're going to continue to face a little bit of pricing headwinds on a per product average revenue per user on the service line. The other piece you're seeing is the end of the national emergency that like I mentioned in my comments. So you think of that as an FSA account that we have with a member that's open for several years, because of the extension. You might have a 23, a 22 and a 21 and a 20-year open. We count that as one account, but we're getting revenue for each of those years. So with all of those national emergency items coming to an end in Q4, you don't see the accounts go away, but the revenue per account does go away in that case. And then the last piece is just mix shift, right? HSA is a low service fee product relative to CDBs. So as we continue to grow HSAs faster than CDBs, we will see blended average revenue per total accounts come down. So you have sort of a multiple headwind there on price. Aside from all of the pricing impacts, service revenue does grow with accounts. So acknowledge that that's a little more challenging to forecast. But that's, we think of sort of service and interchange together as our service revenue streams. They do grow with accounts. The piece we call service has that little extra headwind of pricing pressure and mix shift.\nJon Kessler: Yes. And I was with regard to the question on change, which I prefer to call optimum for reasons that should be obvious. But nonetheless, we'll use change here. We have not seen any on the revenue side, interchange flow side, we have not seen any impact in the Q1 thus far. We certainly took a look at particularly the last couple of days of February when this kind of started out. And so far, I think so good on that front. And but in addition, I will say that since a lot of the kind of public discourse and appropriately so here has been about the speed with which providers are getting paid and pharmacies are getting paid and therefore, be able to give people access to medications and medical services. We have not had any disruption in the payments that we issue. And that includes, the fact that we utilize, change as our partner for, what we call virtual cards. So these are payments to physicians. The virtual card systems of change were not impacted by this incident. And so, we continue to be able to pay get our providers paid and get the our members reimbursed and get our pharmacies paid, and that seems like a good thing. And maybe I'll just as long as you break the topic, I'll say one other thing about it, which is that from a security perspective, while Optum United change have not come forth with much clarity with regard to the sort of underlying vulnerability that was the source of this. We have, there's been a lot of discussion in the intelligence community about in the cyber intelligence community about what it might be. And I suppose one benefit of that is that, it's identified a number of what would have otherwise been zero day vulnerabilities. And our team has been very active in as those kind of come out in that world and we monitor those through our own resources and third parties. As we monitor those items, we identify whether there are threats within our own systems. And if there are any threats within our own systems, we take that. But at the end of the day, it's yet another reminder of the fact that there's a reason why we spend more on cybersecurity than we do on marketing. It's both the right thing to do and it's an appropriate thing to do. And if you're going to be a market leader, you're going to have to step up to that, particularly in an industry where you have both health and financial data in your systems.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: I think this is a good segue. So you're just talking about cybersecurity and it's your focus on that and it's being important. I wanted to pivot to credit risk, not only with your depository, but also your enhanced yield partners. And the reason why is because you're seeing some continuing challenges inside some of the bank companies. And then secondly, there's this persistent concern about commercial real estate exposures. And when I'm just curious how you evaluate your partners both on the depository enhanced yield in the context of these types of external risks that we read about, seems like almost every day?\nJames Lucania: You want me to start with that one, Jon? Look, I mean, I think this is this is the purpose of our we have a custodial cash committee within the company, and the board also provides oversight of the activities of that custodial cash committee. This is what we do. We try to diversify the portfolio of partners that we work with and we do monitor the activity of each of those partners. On the bank deposit side, we're not placing like these deposits are not treated as mass deposits of health equity into the member banks. They're treated as many small deposits that are fully FDIC insured by the federal government. So they add up to $2,000 here and there adds up to a large deposit with the bank. And then on the insurance side, I think as we've talked about, right? We are, at the start of this program, working with highly rated, the blue chip insurance company partners here. And we are adding another criteria there of being a small percentage of their of any of our insurance partners' balance sheet, right? It's not just diversifying the dollars across our partners. We are trying to make sure that we're a very small part of the liabilities of said insurance company. But yes, acknowledge that as we mix shift towards more insurance partner, our ability to risk manage becomes marginally heightened there as we don't have the FDIC pass through.\nGreg Peters: Jon, did you want to add anything or should I just plow on to my follow-up question?\nJon Kessler: Now ahead, sir.\nGreg Peters: So BenefitWallet is the integration is underway. So again, when you're dealing with M&A and you guys have a track record of this, there's always surprises and unforeseen challenges. Is anything popped up on your radar that you want to call out that has been unusual so far? I know you've sort of identified the expectation of when we get expect to transfer everything over. But just curious if it's meeting plans or where there's been some deviations?\nJon Kessler: I think by and large, Greg, so far so good. As you know and others may not, I know you do. But one of the things we did with this transaction is that we structured it such that we're not acquiring any technology systems or the like. And that has a number of benefits. First of all, it significantly reduces the possibility of surprises. But in addition, it also reduces things like temporary cyber security threat environments, those kind of things. And it's been a good model for us for smaller transactions. This will be the largest of not only in fact, this will be the largest HSA transfer, I believe, ever done, but certainly the largest of this type. And so, so far so good. What we will do is once the transaction is complete, as we do with other transactions, we'll give you a precise reporting of accounts, assets or precise is the wrong word, but we'll give you a final tally of accounts and assets, so that you're able to understand the distinction between organic and these kinds of acquisitions. There was if you look back, we talked about kind of where these numbers might end up, but also the agreement itself contemplates the possibility of them being slightly higher or slightly lower depending on any number of factors. And so you'll be able to get a pretty clear view of how this thing ends up and that'll be that. But so far, the team, Brad, Mike Reske, Kelly King and the whole team at HealthEquity as well as at BenefitWallet, the conduit team there have done a great job of moving this thing forward. And we're really excited about the fact that we now begin to welcome members as we've begun to do in the last couple of weeks as each of these tranches is getting 10-K or 8-K I should say.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets.\nSean Dodge : Maybe just coming at the pricing service fee question in a little bit different ways. If we look at revenue per customer, on one of the last calls, Jon, you talked about customer fields, so fields being fees plus yields. As yields have increased, how much pushback or skin, I guess, have you had to give up on the fee side, maybe kind of catalyze more by the higher yields and not necessarily from any change in the competitive landscape. Is there been I guess, has there been a meaningful shift there? And then over the longer run, should we think about average revenue performance customer outside of cross being pretty stable, where lower fees offset higher yields? Or do you think there's some kind of net gain where higher yields you don't necessarily have to give all the back end in fees or lower fees?\nJon Kessler: What your question suggests, Sean, is and it is an important observation is that there is some I'm an economist, so I'll say it this way. There is some cross elasticity between what's happening with yields and in particular what's happening with the spot market and pricing pressure. That's a natural thing, and it makes a lot of sense from the perspective, particularly of larger customers. But I actually think when you look at it, I've been somewhat underwhelmed, I'll say, by the extent to which there has been that kind of competitive pricing pressure. I think the bigger issue is that, is two issues. One is that and as it relates to this year and one is more generally is that is the pace of, for lack of a better term, mix shift as Jim put it earlier. And that mix shift being towards HSA, which in terms of total revenue per customer is awesome or total margin per customer. However you want to think about it is awesome per account. But if I focus solely on service revenues, it's a little bit of a downer, because HSAs tend to have the lowest monthly fees and then there are a few other things. Now you've got the fees from investments in there. But they're going to be lower service fees, whereas conversely, for example, the highest service fee per account product is commuter. Fantastic. And as well as COBRA. But I don't think anyone would say that COBRA is a big margin maker. And it's because you don't have a bunch of other revenue sources there. And so, I think that's really the biggest factor. And so as you model this, I mean, there should be some correlation between the pace of relative growth of HSA versus the rest of our business in terms of accounts. And the pressure that you might see on these for lack of a better term, unit services. Second point is that I think now for more unique to this year is that as we reported, we did very, very well with relative to our expectations this year with our new logo business and particularly with our enterprise. And, of course, enterprise, where you get new logos is, where you're going to be most competitive, particularly when, those logos are coming with existing assets. And so the fact that we did well on assets is in part reflected, the sort of other side of that coin is that, you're going to be more competitive on your HSA fees for that business. So, that's a thing that that's worth considering in particular for this year, but it doesn't move the needle that much. I don't I don't know. I mean expressed on a account, service fee for total account basis, maybe it's moved the needle a half percent. I don't know. And then the last point I'd make is a little bit into our strategic planning horizon. So thinking about beyond fiscal 2025, it is very much our goal or a goal of ours to grow the noncustodial line. Remember, we think about service revenue as inclusive of interchange. And the reason we break out interchange from the rest of service revenue is just that it's big. It's material. But if you look at that line as a whole, or for that matter, exclude interchange if you want to, right? Our goal is very much to see that line grow. And the way that's going to happen is several fold. The first is, as we talked about it at the investor day, you know, it it's going to about the growth of incremental services as we talked about, both new and then turning that CDB growth from, okay. Now we've got it to the place where notwithstanding the national emergency type stuff. It's a black maybe it's a one. I don't know. It's black at least a black zero, but it's not a crooked number. That will be helpful. But also incremental services around data analytics and the like that we talked about at Investor Day. So over time, we do want this thing to grow. We're never going to shy away from the fact that the custodial businesses, the component of revenue is and should be a growth engine for the business, particularly if balances continue to grow. And that we're able, we've been able to and I think we're going to continue to be able to make it both more productive and less cyclical. But it's not like we're forgetting about the service revenue. We're going to try and grow this over time.\nOperator: The next question is from Allen Lutz with Bank of America.\nAllen Lutz: I guess for Jon or Jim here. The technology and development spend has increased pretty dramatically over the past 2 years. But if you look at this past quarter, it was flat year-over-year. And at Investor Day, you talked about a lot of the investments you're making in digital CDB parts, cost transparency, cybersecurity. So I guess as we think about this fourth quarter number here and you think about what's embedded in the fiscal 2025 guidance, do you expect the technology development spend to be more flattish or is that kind of continue to grow trajectory has over the past 24 months?\nJon Kessler: Fire away.\nJames Lucania: Sure. I can take that. So no, you should definitely not assume that the tech and dev spend is going to be flat. I think what we've talked about in the past and Jon has talked about before my time here is that we were reaching the peak last fiscal year of the spending as a percentage of revenue. So we're a little above 22%, kind of 22%-ish now. So we should start seeing more efficiency. But no, we're going to continue to invest in the business. So the idea is efficiency at the margin level, not trying to flatten the raw dollars of tech and dev spend.\nJon Kessler: MJ, do we have another question?\nJames Lucania: Maybe we lost MJ. Did that happen? Without MJ, we got nothing.\nJon Kessler: Yes. I can't bring up the questions. MJ has to do that.\nJames Lucania: Something funny is going on. This call is very adventurous so far, everybody. There's a lot of someone's transcribing me saying this right now, aren't they?\nJon Kessler: Yes.\nJames Lucania: Or maybe not.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Davis with Barclays.\nStephanie Davis : Maybe MJ didn't put me on because she knows how sick you guys are of answering all my questions. I think, I talked to you every week.\nJames Lucania: You got us you got us to Miami, my hometown. Stephanie got us to within, like, literally my hometown of well, I guess, in my case, Miami Beach, which is where we were. So that was we were 50 blocks or something from where I was born. Can't do better than that.\nStephanie Davis : Well, congrats on the quarter. But Florida man, Jon Kessler, I have a question. When I think about your recent investor day versus the last investor day you've had. There was way less CDB talk. And I'm looking at your CDB line, and we're actually seeing account growth again this year. So I love a little bit of a look back on how that industrial logic of marrying HSAs and CDBs played out. And we think about the future, do you think we get to the same level of accounts we saw during the wage transaction, or where does this where does that line go?\nJames Lucania: I really appreciate that question, actually. I mean, I can't get them all, but this one yes. I do. Because you noticed something that as we kind of looked at investor day and things like sometimes things just happen as you go through it and you don't quite notice them, and this is one of them. And, so here's my thought. First, the core logic was not we are going to like, we have leg 1, and now we're going to have leg 2. That sort of thing. It was that acquiring the CDB business at scale gave us the opportunity to grow our HSA business in 2 ways. One, by playing on more fields and two, by, that we weren't able to play on before and two, of course, by giving us clients to cross sell to. And all evidence is that that happened. And the easiest way to see that is that when you look at HSA at either gross HSA openings or net adds, whatever you want to look at, right, when you look at our sales numbers. Notwithstanding the fact that the HSA market is still growing by the same amount year-over-year instead of capturing roughly 20% of that growth as we were pre-wage. Right now we're capturing, and we'll see. I noticed that Devenir put out there. We're going to have our market announcement, like, 5 minutes before this earnings call. So, I'm guessing maybe they listen to the earnings call and they use some of this information and then in a couple of weeks, they have their thing. But they're wonderful people, and I shouldn't tease them that way. But let's say, from an account perspective, we're capturing a third of the market and maybe in the aggregate 30%. And so it works. That having been said, I think, what I would have did say at the time of transaction having at least some amount of expertise in that business was that the CDB business itself was extraordinarily steady. And it turned out it wasn't. And it wasn't primarily as a result of and I don't want to be cheeky about it. I mean, it's primarily as a result of I don't want to adopt responsibility, but it's primarily as a result of pandemic. And even at the outset of the pandemic, as you'll recall, we didn't anticipate the level of unsteadiness of that business. And so, obviously, there's a commuter component that people talk about. But in addition to that, there's the fact that the dependent care, which is part of the FSA piece, when you know, kind of disappeared for a while and is still well below its prior levels. And then, thanks to, some of the recovery legislation, we got this sort of brief, blip in COBRA that then went away. And then in addition to that, we've got the fact that the ACA marketplaces are subsidized and that subsidy appears like it's going to continue. And so actual COBRA uptake relative to which is a portion of COBRA revenues kind of came down. And so like that's a lot of movement that we were not anticipating having to deal with. And so as we look at it going forward, what we want to be doing, as I said in earlier answers, we want to be growing the CDB business. We want to be taking market share. And since the business as a whole is, I'm going to put commuter aside, whatever. Let's assume it's kind of where it is. But broadly speaking, it's only going to grow at the rate of workforce, which is like what percent. When we want to be growing at a crooked number, that means we're taking market share, right? And I think we're well positioned to do that. We have more scale than anyone else. We're actually investing in the product, because as a result of all of our investments, 2 examples being, we have and these are not future examples. They already happen. We are rolling out, we're in the mixed of rolling out what have been through, our chip cards and, like, people say, chip card, what's the big deal? Well, let's, so far, no one else has done something where we have a staff card that is also a chip card that will actually also be available on mobile wallet. What does that mean? It means that you can have 2 or 3 of our products on the same card, and there doesn't even have to be a card, right? Now it's also not easy, because it turns out that unlike regular chip cards, there's not as much standardization as the Mastercard and Visa people think there is out there in the retail world, and so there's some there's some bumpiness there. But it's a great product. Second example is through the use of AI. We've got to a place where you can take, as you saw at investor day, take a picture of a receipt from publics. You can have whatever on there. We can tell you what it is, and we can approve it right then. And that's the biggest pain point with the largest of the CDB products, which is the FSA. So, I think it's reasonable to believe that we can get to a place where we're at single-digit growth in that product. And so that's the plan. We'll also look, Stephanie, we will continue to look carefully at, what do we need to own, what do we not need to own. But it's always going to be in the context, at least as far as I'm concerned. It's going to be in the context of strengthening our core business. Everything we talked about at Investor Day in terms of new product, the health payment account product we talked about, which is a form of smoothing deductible costs for people who don't who do, but also don't have the benefits of HSAs. It's always going to be in service of two things. One is our core product, which is our custodial accounts and the second is the mission of helping people, helping empower consumers and in doing so and saving really saving and improving lives when we listen to what people say. So that being the case, that's how we, that's kind of the framework through which we look at it, and think that's a reasonable view of what you should be expecting from us over time. I would very much have expected to and like to have gotten to that place quicker than we have. It's easy for me to blame the pandemic, but we have some responsibility for that too, including myself.\nStephanie Davis : It kind of shows it's more, it's not that you're not focusing on. It's just that's not an area of innovation as much, which is more kind of the focus for moving forward.\nJames Lucania: What I think is, it's, if you look at for us. Let me say it this way. A piece of in order to achieve the 3-year target that we laid out, this is one of the things that in all likelihood we're going to achieve. That is to say, to go back to I think it was Alan's question. I could be wrong. If I am, I apologize. But regarding service revenue, one of the things we're going to have to achieve to get there is we're going to have to grow that service revenue. We can grow service revenue by innovating new products and innovating and by growing our CDB space. And we can innovate within the CDB space somewhere. And given that, again, I don't think the hurdle is, like, super high, but I do think it's probably fair that it's also true that at the margin, these are not as profitable products. So, is it always going to be the first thing on a priority list? No. That's it.\nStephanie Davis : Thanks sneaking one for Jim? Or is this, I mean, that was a long answer. I'm also happy to give it to you.\nJames Lucania: Go for it.\nStephanie Davis : Let me annoy you with this one. So you've given us a ton of clarity on our custodial revenue. So if I look at the incremental EBITDA dollars in your guidance compared to your incremental custodial profit, there's a pretty big delta in that even compared to prior years, which doesn't really square with this whole shifting of R&D dollars as opposed to like adding new headcount. So is there anything beyond conservatism to call out there about why there would be maybe a lower conversion rate?\nJon Kessler: So maybe a little more clarity because I didn't give you guidance on custodial profit dollars.\nStephanie Davis : But you have given us clarity on the custodial AUM, how it trends. You've given us clarity on what's graduating and you've also stock exchange.\nJames Lucania: I think the one factor that it's important to consider in this whole discussion is the other element of let custodial, which is the CHF. In CHF world, custodial revenue from CHF is going to decline this year. Because if depending on what one believes, but for the forward, SOFR curves, so kind of plain old forward curve that CNBC talks about all day. We're going to have lower short rates later in the year. And that hasn't occurred yet, obviously, but that's reflected in our guide and so forth. So that's the one area in which that short cash area is the one area where you'll see sensitivity. I think that's, I'm guessing that that is the biggest source of the variance that you're describing.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Larsen with BTIG.\nDavid Larsen: Can you talk a little bit about your care coordination software solution? I think it's really interesting how you can compare prices at different providers, hospitals for different procedures that ties in perfectly with like the needs of high deductible account members might have. I think it ties in great with what health plans are trying to accomplish. How many plans is that deployed to how many plans is that deployed to, please? And just any thoughts on like the uptake rate of it and the impact it can have on total cost trend?\nJames Lucania: So let me say first and we tried to make this distinction at Investor Day. This item is still in beta. So it's the deployment today is very limited. And I would describe it more as a feature in my mind than a product. And the reason I say this is that is as follows. There are people who've tried to build businesses out of this as you well know. And for the most part, they have failed. And certainly in the public markets, they have not done well. And the way we've approached it is the view that you can get 80% of the benefit with 20% of the stuff now that you have the benefits of ML for the business logic and generative AI, for the UI to some extent. And so that's what we're really trying to do, and we're going to try and do this across multiple applications. And we're not, I don't really think of it as a unique threat to the businesses that are in that space. They're going to face that threat one way or the other. And so our approach is to partner. So this, for example, this solution is, as we said at Investor Day, is it's not, it's us being able to access some of that logic, through APIs and the like and then also access some of the ML and AI services to kind of make it as good as we can. So I guess I'll just say, one, this is something that's in beta. Two, I would look at it as principally as a source of support for competitive differentiation versus it's going to be in the near-term it's own revenue line. We will, I think, ultimately have some kind of a broad analytics and services business that we'll talk about more. We began to talk about it at Investor Day, but it's early for that. And so I think the way I'd look at it is exactly as you said, which is I think it's good strong feature, and it's an ability to deliver something that people want in a way that's easier for them to consume and that's ultimately less expensive than it's been delivered in the past, which would mean it's going to be made more available. The last part of your question, David, about sort of the impact on broader health care trend, here's my view. Again, I will say as someone who's been part of and observed the battles about all of the massive, all the ways that people have that are supposedly going to bend trend, which for the most part haven't done squat over the years. Here's an interesting fact. When and I'm sorry for the long answer, but we did keep the earlier comment short, the prepared ones. When you, if you look at, healthcare as a percentage of, U.S. GDP, in 2010, it was 17.2%, and the projection was that by now, it would be '24. It's still 17. Right? Nobody talks about that, but it's true. What happened? What changed? It's not I mean, the Affordable Care Act did a bunch of good things in my view, but it did not do much to bend the cost curve. That was not the objective. It enhanced access. The biggest change that's occurred over that period of time has been 2 things. One is, the incremental involvement of consumers in healthcare and the second is the reduction in cost of many of the everyday type pharmaceuticals and procedures that we do, in part because consumers are involved, in part because of the of all of the push towards generics and the like, even if obviously there are certain drugs that are extensive. And, so the way I look at it is, it's not that any of these tools per se bends the trend. It's that they all make the involvement of consumers more effective. And that in the whole is what has a positive effect on the trend among other things. And so that's the way we look at it. And when I look at our clients who have been most effective and tried the hardest to utilize tools effectively over the course of not 1 year or 2 years, but 5 years or 10 years or in the case of I think about one client that we've had now for 17 years. It's not like special, and it doesn't have only a young population and all that kind of stuff. It's not a high-tech type situation. They've been successful at holding healthcare inflation through CPI and not just when CPI was 6%, right? Or 8.4 or whatever it was in last year. And so, you can do this. And it's not going to be the magic that that heals all of healthcare, but it's absolutely part of the toolbox. And our job is to, we didn't create this tool, but we can sharpen it. And in doing so, we sharpen every other tool, whether that tool is wellness program, transparency type stuff, telemedicine, whatever it may be, generics. What we do sharpens every one of those tools, and that's how we help bend the trend, which ultimately makes healthcare more affordable and by helping people understand it, makes them better uses of it.\nJon Kessler: Thanks, David.\nJames Lucania: I feel like Richard's getting really mad at me now. He's getting mad. He's like, I've got answers way too long.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Just relative to BenefitWallet, any updates that you can provide there just in terms of the way of what you expect Conduent had a call? Is there any reason why you shouldn't be able to achieve the same level of profitability or the same interest rates on the funds that they've achieved? Is there anything structurally different? Or is there any portion of the BenefitWallet portfolio that isn't coming over to you?\nJon Kessler: So I think I can give a short answer to this one. To the last part of your question, yes, the answer it well, there are 2 parts. One is the non HSA component of the business so that they have some FSAs and the like, and they are not part of this transaction, and they will continue to be managed by Conduent's broader human resources outsourcing business. And then secondly, of course, as in all transactions, there will be some attrition both in the midst of the transaction and some that might occur shortly thereafter. But that we'll try to account for that and we certainly have tried to account for it in our thinking. As to the first part of your question, I do think it's important to note, and I have to admit I have not looked at the transcript of Conduent's call, but I know that the executive team there is very entertaining. So I'm guessing it was more fun than ours. But I would note that like many of our competitors, the way that Conduent or let me say this without genericize. Many of our competitors, the way that they their strategy for deployment of funds is that they are deployed in banks and importantly, they are deployed at short rates. So that means much more variability. And so if you look at fiscal, let's say or I would say calendar 2023, like that was an awesome strategy in calendar '23. And it continues to be an awesome strategy until it isn't. It would have been a very, very difficult strategy in, let's say, calendar '20. So as you know, we deploy on a ladder, and we've taken a number of steps to kind of make sure that's as smooth as possible. So that will be different. I would not I don't know what Conduent said off the top of my head with regard to this, but you should think about us as deploying these assets in accordance with the ladder and process that Jim has described at Nazi.\nOperator: The next question is from Jack Wallace with Guggenheim.\nJack Wallace : I'll keep this quick. Jim, I think this one's going to be directed at you. Just wanted to get a high-level puts and takes net of any of the reclassifications of what to be about a 50 basis point lift of the EBITDA guide for the year. Just wondering if that's mostly some of the benefits from the technology investments that Jon mentioned earlier or if there's anything else we should be thinking about?\nJames Lucania: Yes. No, nothing huge, right? What we're trying to do is roll in the being a little bit ahead on sales, a little bit ahead on accounts and trying to factor in the comment that I made during the discussion about when markets are good, you see a little bit of shift towards investment from cash, and just small adjustments down the cost line. So yes, 50 basis points, I want to call within the rounding error there, but just providing you a little more precision and with more perfect information here.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jon Kessler for closing remarks.\nJon Kessler: An hour and five minutes. Not bad. Thanks everyone for joining us. We will be releasing our 10-K shortly, working hard to get that done for you, recognizing that there are some changes this year, and I'm sure it will be a real page turner. So thanks all very much.\nJames Lucania: Thank you all.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a nice day."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard Putnam.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks MJ. Hello, everyone and welcome to HealthEquity's third quarter of fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Richard Putnam. I do Investor Relations for HealthEquity. Joining me today is Jon Kessler, President and CEO; Dr. Steve Neeleman, Vice Chair and Founder of the company; and James Lucania, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before I turn the call over to Jon, I have two important reminders. First, a press release announcing the financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2024 was issued after the market closed this afternoon. These financial results include the contributions from our wholly owned subsidiaries and accounts that they administer. The press release also includes definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference today. A copy of today's press release, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures and a recording of this webcast can be found on our Investor Relations website, which is ir.healthequity.com. Second, our comments and responses to your questions today reflect management's view as of today, December 5, 2023, and will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. There are many important factors relating to our business, which could affect the forward-looking statements made today. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from statements made here today. We caution against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We also encourage you to review the discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock as detailed in our latest annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Now, over to Jon.\nJon Kessler: Thank you, Richard. Your emphasis on the word caution, maybe you feel like you know more than you let on, but I know you know a lot. So hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us and happy holidays. I will discuss performance against Q3 key metrics and management's view of current conditions, Richard doesn't know anything more than he's letting on, by the way. Jim will detail Q3 financial results, and then he will provide our raised guidance for fiscal 2024 and an initial outlook for fiscal 2025. And Steve, of course, is here for Q&A. In Q3, the team delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, which was plus 15%. Adjusted EBITDA grew double that at 30%. HSA assets grew 12% year-over-year and HSA members again also at fiscal quarter end grew 8%. Total accounts grew 5%. HealthEquity ended Q3 with 8.3 million HSA members, $22.6 billion in HSA assets and 15.3 million total accounts. Turning to sales. The team added 163,000 new HSA members in the third quarter, which narrowed the year-on-year gap relative to last year to 4% as we begin to lap the [indiscernible] job growth and quit rates from Q1 and Q2. New logo growth driven by a strong performance of our team as well as our expanded network partner footprint helped HSA growth in Q3, just as it has throughout fiscal 2024 to date. HSA assets ended Q3 at 2 -- sorry -- they ended Q3 $2.4 billion higher than a year ago, reflecting not only account, but also balanced growth. Sequentially, invested asset invested HSA assets declined during the fiscal quarter by $0.6 billion due to negative market action and total assets, therefore, declined by the same amount. Members continue to invest their HSA balances, however, partially offsetting market declines. Year-over-year, 12% more of our HSA members became investors, helping to drive up invested assets by 21%. In fact, invested assets now account for nearly 40% of HSA assets. As you know, we believe that our members, our mission and our long-term financial performance all benefit from the continued growth of investing in HSAs. We also continue to see more members choose enhanced rates for their HSA cash, leading to a higher or longer custodial yield and we believe, less cyclicality. While custodial fee growth drove Q3 revenue and margin performance, the team also delivered modest progress on the service line. Service costs actually declined year-over-year and sequentially despite higher volumes, of course, to help drive modest margin expansion. Interchange revenue grew strongly year-over-year and on a sequential basis and is now following its pre-COVID seasonal pattern as we expected, with strength in Q1, followed by a softness in Q2 and especially in Q3. We expect sequential strengthening again in Q4.  Our new CFO will detail our raised outlook for fiscal 2024 and preview fiscal 2025 in addition to providing more detail on Q3 results. Double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion is a pretty good first half. However, Jim would be quick to point out that HealthEquity's current trajectory is years in the making. The team raised the trajectory of HSA growth by adding CV capabilities at scale through WageWorks, it grew the value of each HSA by pioneering affordable and accessible HSA investing and creating the enhanced rates program for HSA cash.  It increased market responsiveness and resiliency by integrating with network, client and ecosystem partners at a return, and it enabled accretive allocation of your capital by uncovering HSA portfolio acquisitions, including BenefitWallet, which upon completion will be our largest such transaction ever. Today, the team is innovating the value drivers of tomorrow, applying cloud, API, data science and SAI technology to HealthEquity's mission to save and improve lives by empowering healthcare consumers. With that, I will turn it over to Jim. Jim?\nJames Lucania: Thank you, Jon. First, let me say, it's been a pleasure to join the HealthEquity team and have the opportunity to meet many of our investors over the past three months. The results we're reporting today are directly linked to the commitment our team makes every day to deliver Purple service to our clients and members. I'll highlight our third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. As always, we provide a reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures in today's press release. Third quarter revenue increased 15% year-over-year. Service revenue was $107.5 million, down 1% year-over-year. Custodial revenue grew 43% to $106.6 million in the third quarter. The annualized interest rate on HSA cash was 258 basis points for the quarter. Interchange revenue grew 7% to $35.1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 64% in the third quarter this year, up from 59% in the third quarter last year. Net income for the third quarter was $14.7 million or $0.17 per share on a GAAP EPS basis. Our non-GAAP net income was $52.2 million or $0.60 per share for the third quarter, up versus $0.38 per share last year. While higher interest rates, increased custodial yields and generated additional interest income, they also increased the rate of interest we pay on the remaining $287 million term loan A to approximately 6.7%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $95.6 million, and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 38%, more than 440 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2024, revenue was $737.2 million, up 17% compared to the first nine months of last year. GAAP net income was $29.3 million or $0.34 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $140.5 million or $1.62 per diluted share, up 69% compared to the same period last year. And adjusted EBITDA was $270.3 million, up 36% from the prior year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 37% for the first nine months of this fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet. As of October 31, 2023, cash on hand was $334 million, boosted by $57 million of cash flow generated from operations in Q3 and $166 million year-to-date. The company had $874 million of debt outstanding net of issuance costs. We continue to have a $1 billion undrawn line of credit available, and we anticipate using both cash and drawing on the line of credit in fiscal 2025 in connection with the closing of the BenefitWallet HSA acquisition.  These strong results, combined with expectations for our Q4 busy season, allow us to raise fiscal 2024 guidance as follows: revenue in a range between $985 million and $995 million; GAAP net income in the range of $34 million to $39 million or $0.39 to $0.45 per share. We expect non-GAAP net income to be between $181 million and $188 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted net income between $2.08 and $2.16 per share based upon an estimated 87 million shares outstanding for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $350 million and $360 million. Our fiscal 2024 revenue increase is primarily based on revised expectations for the average yield on HSA cash to approximately 245 basis points for fiscal 2024. As a reminder, we based custodial yield assumptions embedded in guidance on an analysis of forward-looking market indicators such as the secured overnight financing rate, mid duration treasury forward curves and the Fed funds futures. These are, of course, subject to change. Our guidance also reflects the expectation of higher average interest rates on HealthEquity's variable rate debt versus last year, primarily offset by the reduced amount of variable rate debt outstanding. We assume a projected statutory non-GAAP income tax rate of approximately 25% and a diluted share count of $87 million, which now includes common share equivalents as we expect positive GAAP net income this year. As we have discussed, moving to positive GAAP net income impacts our GAAP tax rate strangely this year. Discrete tax items may also impact the calculated tax rate on a low level of pretax income. Based on our current full year guidance, we expect the GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2024 slightly below 40%. As we have done in recent reporting periods, our full fiscal 2024 guidance includes a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP metrics provided in the earnings release and a definition of all such items is included at the end of the earnings release. In addition, while the amortization of acquired intangible assets is being excluded from non-GAAP net income, the revenue generated from those acquired intangible assets is included. We're also providing the following initial guidance for fiscal year 2025. We expect revenue to be between $1.14 billion and $1.16 billion. We expect margins will expand with adjusted EBITDA growing to approximately 38% to 39% of revenue in fiscal 2025. This initial guidance is based on an estimated average HSA cash yield of about 3%. Based on our outlook of interest rate conditions, current forward yields for next year and the anticipated migration of the BenefitWallet HSAs in fiscal 2025. We expect BenefitWallet ramp-up costs will, in effect, extend our busy season further into the new fiscal year than usual with net positive impacts expected to begin by Q2. A reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA outlook for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, to net income is most -- its most directly comparable GAAP measure is not included because our net income outlook for this future period is not available without unreasonable efforts as we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items excluded from this non-GAAP measure, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and income tax provision or benefit. Before we launch into Q&A, let me give another plug for our Investor Day scheduled for February 22 at our offices in Draper, Utah. We expect to share information about HealthEquity's multiyear strategic initiatives to deliver remarkable experience, deepen partner relationships and drive health and financial outcomes and the impacts we anticipate these initiatives may have on our business model and financial performance over the next several years. You will see product innovations being shared with our clients and partners as well as a deep dive into our plans to accelerate the transition to enhance rates. We're nearing capacity, so if you want to be there and you do want to be there. You will need to register quickly. Please see our IR website or contact Richard. With that, we know you have a number of questions. So let's go right to our operator to kick off Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Good afternoon, Jon, Steve, Jim and Richard.\nJon Kessler: Hello.\nGreg Peters: I'll kick off the first question with the state of the market as it relates to M&A. I know you're working -- will be working to close BenefitWallet in the first half of next year. But another large competitor of yours maybe more have commented on the possibility of monetizing their HSA asset through a sale. So, can you talk about what your appetite looks like for additional M&A? And maybe just how you view your market players behaving in this environment?\nJon Kessler: Yeah. I mean, I think -- first of all, thank you, Greg, for the question. I think the first point is that I think this reflects a trend that has been going on for a while, which is a continued kind of for lack a better from consolidation of the market around a couple of strong scale players. And we're really pleased to be at the head of that group at this point and work very hard for it over time. And one of the things that we've done over this period is really kind of honed our thinking about how we deploy shareholders' capital when we look at competitive transactions. And so, we're in a very fortunate position that -- to the extent that something else is out there. And to the extent that -- one is that you should feel confident that we're going to be able to evaluate it effectively without kind of having to resort to investment banker magic. And that -- secondly, that -- and I think BenefitWallet demonstrates this that we're going to shape transactions in a way that is a win for the seller, but also a win for our shareholders in terms of the timing of accretion and all that kind of thing. So, I think that puts us in a good position if transactions kind of start to happen. I think, secondly, if you -- we will obviously talk about us a little more at the Investor Day, but I think the external models suggest that -- and certainly our forward guidance envisions that the company will continue to generate significant cash flow from operations and free cash flow generally and that those numbers will only grow. So, as I've said before, this is an ideal place for us to deploy capital in ways that generate real return to earnings. And ultimately, we believe to our shareholders. So, we'd be very interested in that. That having been said, I think we also benefit from the fact that we've been beating these bushes for a very long time, and we also know where our -- sometimes why something comes to market where our competitors might be more challenged and those things are going to be reflected in our view of valuation. So that's, I guess, my way of saying, Greg, that if you see something happen, I don't know, mid next year, late next year, and to be clear, I don't -- I have no idea genuinely. And it's not with us. It's not going to be because we didn't take a look at it. It's going to be because we carefully evaluate it and look at the price and decide not to that, and we've done that in the past as well. So, we're happy to hear those kind of rumors. We think they present great opportunities for our shareholders. We're also going to evaluate them carefully.\nGreg Peters: That makes sense. I have a follow-up question, assuming that Richard, the enforcer will permit it.\nJon Kessler: Can I ask you a favor? I'll be the -- let's do one, but I want to -- we did get more murmurings of challenges. And it's like Mr. Bigel's [ph] worth, we don't want you to be angry. So, let's do one. We'll go from...\nGreg Peters: One follow-up?\nJon Kessler: Yeah.\nGreg Peters: Perfect. Just you made a comment in your opening remarks about how the enhanced yield product will give you a higher for longer custodial yield. One of the popular questions that comes inbound is how your custodial yield might perform if interest rates will start to go down. So, maybe you can help us explain what you meant by that comment. That's my last question.\nJon Kessler: Well, let me first -- well, actually, Jim, why don't you take this one?\nJames Lucania: Yes, sure. I can. Yes. So, I mean, obviously, the initial outlook that we provided is based on forward-looking expectations of rates and the market has, for some time, expected rates will come down next year, and that's reflected in our outlook. And we will have a small headwind. We expect to have a small headwind on our client-held funds, right, the deposits that are really held short-term and overnight cash. So that's a small headwind to our yield next year, but we're still seeing the reinvestment rates at significantly higher rates than the cash is maturing at. So, we are growing average HSA yields in a declining interest rate -- short-term interest rate environment.\nGreg Peters: Okay. But in your comment, you said the enhanced yield gives it higher for longer. I was just -- I'm sorry -- I've expired my two questions. Thanks.\nJon Kessler: I'm guessing there might be another one about this topic. So, we're happy to go into more. Who's next?\nOperator: The next question is from Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first on the preliminary -- hi. On the preliminary guidance, I guess, first, how should we think about the BenefitWallet assets that are flowing in? Can you give us a sense of the timing of when these tranches are going to come in? To what extent are we getting the benefit through the year? And associated with that, maybe I'll layer a couple of more questions in here. Do you have to pay any fees on those assets moving into your custodial accounts let's start there.\nJon Kessler: Yeah. I think I can take this one. So, let me start with the second part of your question, Stan. As you recall, in prior transactions, we've had a component where there's a seller -- a third-party custodian that we have to pay. We had that in the WageWorks transaction. We have that here. That's baked into -- technically the way it works in this case is, it's the seller paying the fees, and we have agreed as part of -- and I think we disclosed this at the time the agreement was signed. We have agreed to cover, I believe, someone correct me if I'm wrong, $20 million of such fees within the purchase price. So that doesn't impact our projection of go-forward income or the income statement in any way, it's just -- it's a purchase price accounting issue. And then with regard to the first part of your question, the way to think about this, I think, is that -- and Jim mentioned this briefly in his opening remarks, is that we will see incremental service expense effectively our busy season extending into the first bit of the fiscal year as we prepare to bring on these accounts, it would be silly to fully ramp down and then ramp back up again. So, there'll be some -- and even if we were doing that, we would still see incremental costs. So, you'll see some incremental service costs. And then in Q2, we should start to kind of net out to a positive here as we begin to onboard these accounts. And so, our guidance kind of reflects that idea that these placements -- sorry -- these transitions will occur kind of in that timeframe. And by the second half of the year, we'll be at run rate. And as we've discussed elsewhere, this kind of accretes very quickly. So, if that's helpful for you. We can't -- I would say there's some uncertainty here as there often is, but that's our current expectation.\nStan Berenshteyn: That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just a quick one on services gross margin. Clearly, you're making some progress here. Can you maybe share any updates on the adoption of your tech-based communications with your members and whether or not that's -- you're recognizing some tangible improvements on the gross margin side there?\nJon Kessler: Yeah. Well, Jim talked about the progress on gross margin generally. I think, obviously, if you look at service expense and the like, the ability to kind of be in a good spot here relative to volume growth speaks to the point that you're making, particularly given that we're also fighting things like wage growth, there are headwinds in this area. And so, yeah, I commented elsewhere that we've made -- we look at this month-over-month. And what we're really trying to do is ultimately, it's not just -- it's in part the move from voice to chat, but it's also ultimately the move from live to automated in areas where members really get value out of that. And there are clearly a lot of those. And so, we continue to see kind of, I would just say, quarter-over-quarter progress. It's not -- and we've never suggested it was the magic bullet, but the ultimate opportunity to take significant costs out of service delivery while delivering actually a better experience for members through digitization. I mean this is, as I've said, elsewhere, is a no-brainer in terms of sort of ironic to say this in terms of the applications for generative AI, just damp this stuff really works. And so, we think that, that will continue. And we think that what we do is actually an excellent application for it because precisely because it's not -- it's always as simple and people's questions aren't always as formed in exactly the same way. And yet, we want to be able to generate the right answers.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks Stan.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJon Kessler: Hey, Allen.\nAllen Lutz: Thanks for taking the questions and welcome, Jim. A couple on the financial side. So, I just want to ask on the 3% custodial yield guide for next year, how much of those contracts have already been set? And then, one follow-up related to the financials. Is BenefitWallet fully incorporated into the fiscal 2025 guide? And then I have a follow-up.\nJon Kessler: That sounds like three, that's three.\nJames Lucania: Yeah. So, as Jon said, our expectation about the -- both the ramp-up cost, the transition cost, migration costs and then, of course, the benefit of having the accounts on our platform are built in to the 2025 guide. As our -- those assets will be invested at market rates, which will obviously pull up the average rate earned on HSA yield. So yes, BenefitWallet is a contributor to revenue and to the higher yield that we're going to be guiding to here.\nJon Kessler: And then just to the first part of your question about placements, the math is a little different with enhanced rates now, where we can do placements throughout the year. So, it's a little less relevant, but a way to think about it is that we will do -- we do placements mostly when money moves in terms of when rates are cut. So about a third of that happens in the -- if you sort of think about that year-end bulk, about a third of it's in fiscal Q4 and say calendar Q4 and then two-third is kind of in that change rate period. But I would caution that -- just I would caution on that last point, enhanced rates does have the benefit that allows us to draw that out a little bit. And so, over time, what you'll have to get used to is -- and I think this will be good is that it's not going to be sitting and waiting for what the rate is on a given day, that's going to matter as much for those kinds of placements.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Larsen with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nDavid Larsen: Hi. Congratulations on an excellent quarter. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about expectations for yield longer term? Obviously, I wouldn't ask for guidance for fiscal 2026. But since it takes three years to recontract your book of business, let's say, rates hold steady or decline slightly next year, maybe they declined slightly in fiscal 2026. Could your yield still go up, which would obviously benefit custodial in fiscal 2026?\nJon Kessler: Jim, do you want to hit this one?\nJames Lucania: Simple answer is yes. Obviously, it depends how far rates decline. But yeah, I think you said if rates remain stable, then yes, we'd expect the average rate to continue. There are strong tailwinds in that number.\nDavid Larsen: Okay.\nJon Kessler: The key issue is that one of the things that we really do get benefit of if you think about it. I appreciate your point about three years, but think about like the duration contracts, you think about what we're going to be replacing next year, those duration contracts next year will be the first ones that we're replacing, right, that are pandemic era. So the stuff that's being repriced is going to be repriced in very favorably. And beyond that, if I take current market projections about where rates will be in a year or what have you as sort of consistent with your question, we will still be placing new money at rates well above our current guide of 3%. And so, those will continue to be, I think, pretty significant tailwinds for yield for quite some time actually. Again, without wanting to give particular guidance, I mean those are the key factors, and it's what you can replace money at relative to what you had at that before and what you're placing new money at. And both of those appear to be tailwinds for quite a while under any current reasonable scenario over the course of the next several years.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. Great. And I think Richard will allow me one more maybe. So, it was nice to see the interchange revenue up, I think, 7% year-over-year. For service revenue, I think it was down maybe 1% year-over-year, but I think there's some unusual things causing that. When should we expect to see growth in service revenue sort of return to a more normalized rate? What is the driver of that? And what would you expect sort of that longer term normalized service revenue growth rate to be? Thanks very much.\nJon Kessler: You want to hit that one, Jim?\nJames Lucania: Yeah. Sure. I can take that one. Yeah. So I think -- yeah, you really hit right on the story for Q3. We've effectively held serve on that line with revenue slightly down, cost slightly down, the margin is slightly up, but there's a lot of moving parts and stories within that within those headline numbers. So, if you sort of look at it, and we do look at it by product and you see a price volume mix story occurring there where price has been a headwind, especially in RA as buyers look at this as a bundle, really. They understand we're making a much higher revenue on the custodial cash and the HSA cash. They understand we're making good margin on the interchange, and this is the release valve on price. So, we're seeing a little bit of price per unit price headwind. We see the impact of the mix shift, especially towards HSAs. We're growing HSA significantly higher. That's always been the lowest fixed dollar fee product as it's got the highest percentage of interchange and custodial revenue attached to it. So as our business mix towards that, we're going to see that pressure on the revenue line and that margin line. And you can call that sort of the half-and-half impact price and mix and then being offset by our much higher volumes. So negative price, negative mix, positive volume, that's out to just about $1 million delta on the revenue line.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks David.\nOperator: The next question is from Anne Samuel with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnne Samuel: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for the question. In the past, you've kind of talked about a gradual increase for your deposits going into the enhanced rates product, but with BenefitWallet, you're going to see kind of a big jump up in that mix. Are you where you want to be now? Or should we expect that to continue to kind of increase as a percentage of the mix over time? Where are you hoping to get with that?\nJon Kessler: You should expect it to increase as a percentage of the mix over time. And we -- if you're willing to make the step out of Salt Lake City or listen in, I think we'll talk more about that, so people can get a clear view of it over time. But we're extremely pleased with a couple of aspects of this program. And one is that is that on a voluntary basis, there's -- the consumer adoption has been great. I think consumer acceptance of what we're trying to do has been great. I feel like employers who -- those who pay attention to this, understand that the fact that we've done this has really kept us from having to impose other costs on them and also see us reinvest in the business. I'm extremely pleased with -- I just don't have to say it with the -- any other way with the work that the team has done to educate the best possible partners we can have for this product. I mean, we went into this with the biggest question in our mind was actually -- what's going to be the receptivity within -- what is appropriately a very conservative market on the insurance side to a product that has a lot of great attributes for them, but they just haven't had before. And the receptivity has been great. It's been great among very high-quality NIMs and the stable there continues to grow. And so, we're absolutely looking at options to accelerate, if anything, the shift into this product, and we'll talk a little more about that. I'm guessing at the Investor Day and its impact in the out years.\nAnne Samuel: That's really helpful then. And I guess, as we kind of think about as you get bigger and bigger with this product, is it still right to think of it as kind of a 50 to 75 basis point premium to your kind of traditional yield? Or can that change over time as well?\nJon Kessler: I think that's still probably right. And it's -- I think that's still probably right answer.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks Anne.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good evening guys.\nJon Kessler: Hey, George.\nGeorge Hill: Good evening. And just a couple of housekeeping questions actually for me. I guess, number one, Jon or Jim, could you guys talk about the expected EBITDA contribution from BenefitWallet in fiscal 2025. And my follow-up is, I know you guys have some lumpiness of cash rolling off to be redeployed as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months. Can you just kind of remind us on the big pieces that kind of come off being committed and get recommitted and so, we can kind of fine tune our models around the waterfall effect of that. Thanks.\nJon Kessler: Why don't I -- do you want me to take the first half and you take the second half, Jim?\nJames Lucania: Sure. Yeah, sure.\nJon Kessler: Okay. So, a way to think about BenefitWallet is that as I suggested earlier, we're going to get a little bit more than half a year impact. Maybe you could say, I don't know, maybe say two-thirds of your impact, I don't know somewhere around there this year. And this product -- this transaction like prior transaction that we've done is going to be highly accretive. So, it's certainly -- we were already anticipating that we would be delivering a nice implied boost in EBITDA margins. And I think this has just helped us accelerate for lack of a better term, where we ultimately felt we would get to as we have accounts mature and so forth. So, the way I think about the first question is -- and I would encourage some of do modeling, but I think -- I remember, George, you asking me several years back, whether the company could return at some point, and I think you were being a little bit let the word I want. You were sort of poking me a little bit, saying can you guys return to EBITDA margins with a poor handle, we're offering guidance right now for next year between 38, 39. And so this has sort of accelerated some of that process, and that seems like a good thing. Jim, on the second half. Do you want to take that one, which was about -- I think, about the timing of asset we deployed.\nJames Lucania: Yeah, exactly reinvestments. And yeah, you're exactly right. Like the -- there's sort of a block of wage bumps in assets that are going to be maturing actually not so much in next fiscal year. We've got a relatively smaller block of assets maturing Q4 of this year and throughout next fiscal year, and it will be the following two years where some of those lumpier blocks are going to be maturing. We're being reinvested is a better word to say.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks George.\nJon Kessler: The way to think about that, is since we deployed the original wage assets in, I'm going to say, calendar 2021, no, calendar 2020. And the kind of core piece of that is five-year, right? You'll see a lot of that roll over in the middle of calendar 2025. There's a little of it this year, but you get the idea. And the rollover well because we all know where we were in 2020. Sorry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, and let me add my congratulations. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about you had good new logo sales. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the enterprise side just in terms of both from a competitive perspective, but also in terms of the desire to shift part of the employee population to HDHPs, particularly in light of the accelerating healthcare costs that are coming through. And then I've got a follow up.\nJon Kessler: Do you want to hit this one?\nJames Lucania: Sure. Happy to. Hey, Mark. How are you? I expect you'll be out in February.\nMark Marcon: Absolutely.\nJames Lucania: Because we did get our first biggest snowstorm as we can. Anyway, so kind of an order, yeah, I mean, we've talked about in the comments that this -- we're seeing some good progress on bringing on these new enterprise logos. And this has been a lot of work, a lot of time into it. We've not only refined our marketing message and brought on some great sales team members that are hustling there, but also I think our product suite is continuing to have evolved to take care of their needs. I mean we're doing some really nice things there. So, I think the bottom line is we're pleased with the progress we've made in the new logos. Now I'm continually amazed -- and maybe it's just because, as you know, Mark, every year, I tell a little fact that this is from the Kaiser study, the average high deductible plan that is HSA qualified in the country is about $4,800 per family plan. And the average non-HSA deductible, let's say, for a PPO plan is about $2,900. So, as those numbers keep getting closer, it really doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense for people not to opt into the HSA, right? And so, we just keep helping employers and then in kind of the perfect world, they allow us to then speak directly to their employees about the benefits, tax benefits and everything else around the health savings account. And with the deductibles narrowing like that [indiscernible], it's really hard not to argue they should just set up for because they're going to basically close that gap on any contributions they can get from their employer and then also, of course, tax savings, right? So, we just keep promoting it, and we're seeing some great uptake in our relationship management team are marketing are doing a great job delivering that message. And so, our work is never complete. There are still employers and sectors that tend to be slower adopters, which means there's still a lot of fruit and tree, but we're continuing to do everything we can to check trees, and this is a great time of year and we're making good progress with messaging. So, I'd say thumbs up in both cases, good new logo growth and then also good work with enterprise team and actually the market and bringing on more growth.\nMark Marcon: That's fantastic. And then, can you just comment a little bit more about the competitive environment? I mean, obviously, that may get consolidated. But then in addition to that, there's other big players with rates going up, how should we think about service fees over the next year and things of that nature. Obviously, you're gaining more than your fair share of the market and continue to gain share. But just wondering if you can give us some more comments on that.\nJames Lucania: Yeah, Jon, how do you want to break that up?\nJon Kessler: Why don't you talk about the competition piece, and I'll hit the service fee discussion.\nJames Lucania: Perfect. Yeah. So, the competition has evolved a little bit, partly because there's been some consolidation, as you mentioned. I mean, a lot of these companies that we used to see is pretty good competitors, whether it be wage or some of the more recent ones we've added are now part of the HealthEquity family, which is pretty awesome. And so that being said, I mean, we do have some powerful competitors out there, but it's kind of the same message. If somebody is buying their healthcare services from a large health plan out there that is one of our competitors, then that large health plan will push pretty hard. We do win in that environment because I think people know that HealthEquity has got this kind of single focus on the parent healthcare consumers, and that's kind of what's carried us now for 20 years, right, being that kind of independent, single focused provider that can really nail the HSAs and the CDBs and with the bundle and things like that. We have the same competitive threat on the retirement side. But that's where I think we -- more the level of playing field is with our partnerships, right? Because we've got great -- I mean, the health plan partnership with, I think, is pretty storied in HealthEquity land, and you all know that the success we've been able to have and take care of those health plan partners and they bring us a lot of even a broader footprint than you might get if you're a large health plan and you can kind of fish within your own pond, but we get to fish in many plants. And then on the retirement side, we've got our partners there, too. So look, I don't think it's evolved much I'd love to see if Jon sees it differently, but it's kind of the same thing. It's just that it has been consolidating, and we've been, I think, up in our game on some of the things we're doing, like I mentioned earlier around our product settings like that.\nJon Kessler: Yeah. I mean, I love what's going on with the product. There's some really cool stuff that we're talking about with clients and working on and rolling out and that just is -- I mean, it's not rocket science, but is about helping consumers do the right things with these products and also helping employers understand what's actually going on within their base, not just in finance, but on the health side, are people using the free stuff that they're supposed to be using in these plans preventive, et cetera. So, I do think relative to what our competitors do or the bulk of our competitors, we do more of it, and we do more of it without dictating what the rest of your ecosystem is. And that's always been where we succeed, and I think we'll continue to see. As far as pricing -- we are -- as I think Jim commented in the prepared remarks, but certainly, we're always going to be in an environment where the effective custodial yields continue to expand, and obviously, balance continue to grow. If you think about it from the employer's perspective or whatnot, one way to the first place you look in terms of sort of across elasticity is you look at the fees that you actually pay. And so, we've done a number of things over time. I can quite successfully to stabilize that. But we have -- as Jim commented earlier, right, if you look at the current quarter, right, you've got roughly speaking, you can do the math, you've got on -- if you look at total accounts on a unit basis, right, you've got, give or take, 5% lower year-over-year. About half of that is mix and half of it is actual fee reduction. The mix stuff will come and go. Will we sell more HRAs versus FFCAs next year, I don't know. But the fee component is there, and we're going to roll with that. So, I don't -- I think we're trying to be, I think, conservative in what we're assuming there is certainly realistic, because we don't really want to be losing business over fees. We want to be treating people fairly on fees, recognizing that, particularly with our core product. There's a lot of ways to make money. At the same time, I think as you then I'll stop, as you may recall, in some of our ancillary products, where as a result of the wage is not WageWorks and such, we felt like profitability wasn't really there. COBRA being the example. We had a very large project over the course of -- but still the impact of which is still rolling out and will help us a little bit next year, but nonetheless, to raise fees. So, we're not afraid to do it. We just want to do what makes sense. And where it makes sense is in areas like that, it makes sense for us to be competitive when it comes to HSA. Last thing I'd say that gives us some level of stability here. But again, I don't think unit fees are like rising substantially. The stability is the diversity of our distribution. And what that does is it produces a client base that has enterprise where things are extremely competitive, as I've said before, because they come with assets and therefore, you can underwrite that versus your smaller employers and the like, where you can't do that. And so, there's going to be more of a fee base. And then, of course, you have retail. And so that level of diversity of distribution and of account and so forth, that actually also lends to stability in that service line. So, I guess that's a long way of saying our guidance reflects a little bit of conservatism there, consistent with kind of the numbers we're reporting here in terms of price impact, maybe not so much mix impact. But fundamentally, I think if you look at a big picture, it's a relatively modest price to pay for the benefits of what we see as ultimately a product that's obviously becoming more profitable, and you can see that in terms of what we're tapping the bottom line.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Wallace with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nJon Kessler: Hi, Jack.\nJack Wallace: Hey, how's it going? Congrats team Purple, another great quarter.\nJon Kessler: Thank you.\nJack Wallace: I've got a couple of model monkey questions for you. I just wanted to make sure we're clearing up the yield understanding here. First one on when cash gets deployed, is it on a five-year duration? Or is it three years or three years the duration to the book on average?\nJon Kessler: You want to hit this one, Jim?\nJames Lucania: Yeah. I mean, you should -- the answer is historically, it's been, yes, all of the above, 3, 4, 5-year contracts, but I think you should generally be modeling five years as our baseline investment product.\nJack Wallace: Thanks. That's helpful.\nJames Lucania: Using five-year treasury as your baseline REIT.\nJack Wallace: Excellent. And then for the fourth quarter this year, it looks like there's an implied sequential step down in the daily cash AUM yield. Is that just related to some of the cash that's exposed to the front end of the curve? Or is there something else going on there? Just thinking about also the comment earlier about a third of the AUM that gets repriced, so to speak, in December. I would think that would have a positive impact versus a negative.\nJon Kessler: Yeah. I don't think there's a step down in Q4, I could be wrong. Maybe if, Jim, if you have the numbers in front of you, it's not.\nJames Lucania: No. Yeah, no. There's nothing that stands out. Like you may -- you're talking about the you're talking about like the client-held funds short and there, like we may see some dollars coming down, right, as the impact of our treatment that we talked about last quarter. But no, we're not assuming any big shifts in the short rate.\nJon Kessler: Maybe we can revert to you offline and make sure you've got right math. But to get the three next year, the HSA cash rate will be higher in Q4 than it has been year-to-date. And on CHF, in Q4, I mean, it's -- you know what short rates are going to be in the rest of Q4. So, I don't -- there's not a lot in on there.\nJack Wallace: Thank you.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks Jack.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jon Kessler for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJon Kessler: I didn't know we were done. Wow. Okay. So, I just wanted to say that I tried to get Jim in his opening remarks to say that Investor Day was going to be better than cap [ph] and he wouldn't do it. And I'm trying to bump doubt about that. And if you care about making you feel better than come to our Investor Day. And if you can't do that or even if you can, we'll be at certain unnamed conferences in January, no doubt with any. And before that, we've got a bunch of other investment activity happening. This is a great time to be where we are, and the credit for that, in my mind, really does belong to our team, as well as to our clients and partners. We have -- I'm so pleased at what -- at the level of partnership we're seeing with our employers and our health plan retirement plans and then the level of partnership on our team right now. We're doing a lot of tough stuff behind the scenes to set the company up for expansion, not just next year, not just following the year, but for many years to come. And you may not see it all, but it's a ton of work. And it doesn't all go perfectly, but it all gets done, and it all gets done with people who are working really hard. So I just want to spend a minute to say thank you on that.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\nJon Kessler: Thank you."

Please go ahead.\nRichard Putnam: Thank you, Rocco. Hello, everyone. Welcome to HealthEquity's Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Richard Putnam, Investor Relations for HealthEquity. Joining me today on the call is Jon Kessler, President and CEO; Dr. Steve Neeleman, Vice Chair and Founder of the Company; the Company's CFO, Tyson Murdock; and is soon to be CFO, James Lucania. Before I turn the call over to Jon, I have 2 important reminders. A press release announcing the financial results for our second quarter of fiscal 2024 was issued after the market closed this afternoon. These financial results include the contributions from our wholly owned subsidiaries and accounts that they administer. The press release also includes definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference today. A copy of today's press release, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures and a recording of this webcast can be found on our Investor Relations website, which is ir.healthequity.com. Second, our comments and responses to your questions today reflect management's view as of today, September 5, 2023, and will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC, which include predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. There are many important factors relating to our business, which could affect the forward-looking statements made today. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from statements made here today. We caution against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we also encourage you to review the discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock as they are detailed in our latest annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. One more note before turning this over to Jon, which you now on board, we have rescheduled our Draper Investor Day to February 22. We're hoping for another great year of snow for those who want to ski on the greatest snow on earth. And we hope all will join us either in person or virtually. Over to you, Jon.\nJon Kessler: Okay. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will discuss Q2 key metrics and management's view of Kirk conditions. And Tyson will touch on Q2 results before detailing our raised guidance for fiscal '24, and Steve is here for Q&A. In Q2, the team delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, which was plus 18%; and adjusted EBITDA, which was plus 31%, HSA assets grew 13% and HSA members grew 9%. Total accounts grew 3% muted by the previously discussed change in COBRA methodology. HealthEquity ended Q2 with 8.2 million HSA members, $23.2 billion in HSA assets and 15 million total accounts. The team added 156,000 new HSA members in its fiscal second quarter, which is healthy, but down from the record setting Q2 last year. As in Q1, comparison to last year's blistering job growth and high turnover as well as fewer -- he transfers from small banks were offset by robust new logo growth driven by an expanded network partner footprint and HR departments seeking out win-wins. The team also added $883 million in HSA assets in Q2. I wanted to say a whopping 883, but I wasn't allowed to. So I didn't say that. That's compared to a $272 million increase in the year ago period, which would not be as swapping, reflecting not only count growth but also balance growth. Despite inflation, average HSA balances at HealthEquity grew both sequentially and year-over-year, in part due to investment. 11% more of our HSA members became investors year-over-year, helping to drive up invested assets by 23%. Remarkably, invested assets now account for 40% of HSA assets. We continue to see more members choose enhanced rates for their HSA cash, leading to higher for longer custodial yields and we believe less cyclicality in the future. Interest rates in Q2 also gave a boost to variable rate HSA cash and CDB client funds. While custodial fee growth drove Q2 performance, the team also delivered modest progress on service fees, the bulk of which come from ancillary CDP administration products. Service revenue rose 3% year-over-year, in line with total accounts. Service costs grew just 2% year-over-year and declined sequentially by more than $4 million. As we discussed last quarter, rapid improvement in service tech continues to drive more interactions to chat and automated responses. The runout of remaining tailwinds from the COVID-19 national emergency may obscure a bit the progress that we're making when we get to the second half, but we see the results we've delivered here in Q2 as well as in the first quarter as evidence of positive trajectory on service revenue and margin. Finally, interchange revenue, which resumed its seasonal pattern as expected, with strength in Q1 followed by a more subdued performance in Q2. We think the HSA market HealthEquity now leads can grow by about 10% annually for years to come, thanks to steady account growth and faster asset growth as accounts mature, which in turn expands margin opportunity. Team Purple can extend its long record of outperformance by doing what it did well in this second quarter. Before turning the call over, I would like to publicly thank Mr. Tyson Murdock for his unwavering service to HealthEquity's mission, vision and values over the past 5.5 years. And in particular, for focusing his team on a strong finish and a smooth transition over these past few months. Pason's a class act, and you would do well to keep an eye out for the opportunity in whatever he chooses to do next. As Richard noted at the top of the call, Jim Lucania who will take over as CFO effective tomorrow, is with us today. Jim will be active on the conference circuit this fall, beginning tomorrow actually. And of course, will preside at HealthEquity's Investor Day in Utah in February, as Richard mentioned.\nTyson Murdock: All right. Thank you, Jon, for those kind of comments. All right. I'll highlight our second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures is found in today's press release. Second quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year. Service revenue was $105.7 million, up 3% year-over-year. The total revenue grew 51% to $98.9 million in the second quarter, and the annualized interest rate yield on HSA cash was 237 basis points. Interchange revenue grew 4% to $38.9 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 62% in the second quarter of this year versus 57% in the year ago period. This is the highest gross margin quarter since we acquired WageWorks 4 years ago. Net income for the second quarter was $10.6 million or $0.12 per share on a GAAP EPS basis. Our non-GAAP net income was $45.6 million for the second quarter, and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.53 per share compared to $0.33 per share last year. While higher interest rates increased custodial yields and generated interest income, they also increase the rate of interest we pay on the remaining $287 million Term Loan A to a stated rate of 6.9%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $88.1 million, and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 36%, a more than 360 basis point improvement over last year. For the first 6 months of fiscal '24, revenue was $488 million, up 18% compared to the first 6 months of last year. GAAP net income was $14.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $88.4 million or $1.02 per diluted share, up 74% compared to the same period last year. And adjusted EBITDA was $174.7 million, up 39% from the prior year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 36% for the first half of this fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet. As of July 31, 2023, cash at quarter end was $290 million, boosted by a record $77 million of cash generated from operations in Q2 and $109 million year-to-date. The company had $874 million of debt outstanding net of issuance costs, and we continue to have an undrawn $1 billion line of credit available. For fiscal '24, we're raising guidance and now expect the following: revenue in the range between $980 million and $99 million, GAAP net income to be in a range of $19 million to $24 million. And we expect non-GAAP net income to be between $171 million and $179 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted net income between $1.97 and $2.06 per share based upon an estimated 87 million shares outstanding for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $338 million and $348 million. Our $5 million midpoint revenue increase is primarily based on revised expectations for the average yield on HSA cash to approximately 240 basis points for fiscal '24. As a reminder, we base interest rate assumptions embedded in guidance on an analysis of forward-looking market indicators such as the secured overnight financing rate and mid-duration treasury forward curves and Fed funds futures. These are, of course, subject to change. Our expectations are tempered somewhat by the anticipated impact of the end of the national emergency period that Jon referenced in his remarks on service revenue. Average crediting rates our HSA members receive on HSA cash remained flat sequentially and the crediting rates our HSA members received are determined in accordance with the formula described in our custodial agreements with them. We continue to expect these rates will rise as overall interest rates remain elevated and have included in our guidance, a 5 basis point increase by the end of fiscal '24. Our guidance also reflects the expectation of higher average interest rates on HealthEquity's variable rate debt versus last year, partially offset by the reduced amount of variable rate debt outstanding. And then we assume their projected statutory non-GAAP income tax rate of approximately 25% and a diluted share count of $87 million, which now includes common share equivalents as we anticipate positive GAAP net income this year. As we have discussed, moving to positive GAAP net income impacts our GAAP tax rate strangely this year. Discrete tax ends may also impact the calculated tax rate on a low level of pretax income. Based on our current full year guidance, we expect roughly a 50% GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2024. As we have done in recent reporting periods, our full fiscal 2024 guidance includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP to the non-GAAP metrics provided in the reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP metrics provided in the earnings release and a definition of all such items is included at the end of the earnings release. In addition, while the amortization of acquired intangibles is being excluded from non-GAAP net income, the revenue generated from those acquired intangible assets is not excluded. My time serving our members, our teammates and investors over the last 5.5 years has been a real pleasure. We made a lot of progress, and I'm confident the team will continue the course as I've driven to my next opportunity. And with that, we know you have a number of questions. So let's go right to our operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Greg Peters at Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: I guess before I begin with my question, Tyson, I'd also like to congratulate you on your service and health equity, certainly help compete to some challenging times. Jon, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about sustaining a 10% growth. And I was just curious about your perspective of the macro environment from a competitive standpoint. You're seeing numbers from Dubner and others just and some are having some success, maybe as much success in growing share as you are, while others are not. Just an updated view on how the market looks to you today.\nJon Kessler: Well, I think if you sort of think about where the market is, you have two factors that ultimately drive revenue growth, which is the first thing that as investors we care about. The first is account growth and the second is asset growth. And account growth in my view, will -- if I look at it on a multiyear basis, we'll kind of be in the high single digits and asset growth will be in the teens. And revenue growth is typically somewhere between the two. I think -- and I don't really see any reason for much change in that view based if I'm trying to ask the question over multiple years. And then look, our job is to outperform the market in terms of assets, accounts, et cetera, and then to do a better job, the best job we possibly can and hopefully a better job than others at generating both revenue and profitability from doing so.\nGreg Peters: All right. My detail -- my follow-up detailed questions on free cash flow. Nice improvement on a year-over-year basis, it looks like the gap between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow is narrowing. Maybe you can just update us on how you're looking at free cash flow for the balance of this year? And are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about with free cash flow as we think out beyond this year?\nJon Kessler: Maybe Tyson, would you mind starting with regard to the sort of balance of this year question? Anything in particular that -- I think the quest gist of the question is, was there some jump forward or the like?\nTyson Murdock: No. I mean I think this is to be expected as the custodial revenue increases with the very high margin and cash generation capability, we know that it's going to accelerate that cash. And as you see, the positive GAAP net income come in, it's overcome now all the amortization from the wage works and other deals that are in there. So the business is starting to pure on that generation of custodial cash and I'd expect that to continue going forward. Of course, the one -- there's other -- there's things in there like we're going to start to pay taxes. So you got wires going out for taxes, you can see that in there. And other than that, I think the other things that are in there, like property, plant and equipment purchases and just what we spend on tech and things like that. There isn't huge changes in there that would cause other things to occur. So it's going to continue to and move up.\nJon Kessler: And Greg, as far as use of cash, we're -- first of all, it's worth noting that if we do nothing, over the course of multiple years here, and it's not too many. The free cash flow is basically going to eliminate our leverage. And we're very comfortable with current leverage. I don't don't want anyone to take my statement as suggesting otherwise. But that's probably not what's going to happen, meaning we probably will want to look at using that cash and -- or we will want to look at using that cash as we have in recent quarters. And from my perspective, in terms of order of cash utilization, there's portfolio transactions that we like because they are reliable ROI. And then we've paid down a little bit of our term A. I would expect that where portfolio transactions aren't available or where it makes sense at some point, we'll continue to do that. And then, it’s worth noting that within the current envelope, we’ve committed to investing in organic innovation. And you’re starting to see pieces of that come through. You will see more pieces of it come through. And it’s, I think, helpful when we get a question, as I’m sure we will later about T&D expense and the like that we’re able to do that within the envelope we have and ultimately, while bringing T&D expense as a percentage of revenue down over time.\nJon Kessler: Thanks, Greg. Have a safe light.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo.\nStan Berenshteyn: Thanks for going to answer my questions [ph]. On a personal -- not yet, not yet, although I'd like to. But I would like to say on a personal note, Tyson has been a pleasure working with you. Maybe a couple of questions. First one on your sales pipeline. Any changes in the RFP volumes you're seeing? Any changes in your win rates or perhaps what employers are looking for?\nJon Kessler: Yes. Probably the most notable thing we've seen Stan this year is -- I mean, let me back up and say, generally, the commentary I would give on account growth is that, on the one hand, and similar to what we said in the first quarter, on the one hand, you've got the sort of less tailwind from a macro perspective, new job creation and so forth. And then on the other hand, we are seeing higher new account onboarding and then more importantly, the sort of pipeline and start work for fiscal Q4 calendar January build. And the source of that bill is -- so that's all providing a bit of an offset. And I think when I look at the pipeline, what's interesting this year is for the first time since the pandemic, the enterprise pipeline has been very robust. And I'm not prone to like give answers without data. One answer that is given is okay. People now have the space to make changes that they weren't willing to make. That's certainly possible. But in any event, it is worth noting that I think the biggest thing I would note that's different is the volume of enterprise deals that we are seeing and that are turning out not to be just price checks or whatever we're able to win business away from competitors as well as greenfield business.\nStan Berenshteyn: Got it. That’s helpful. And then one more on custodial assets. Can you get an update on the current mix of assets that are in enhanced yields? And where do you expect that mix will be 12 months from now?\nJon Kessler: So we've given guidance for the guidance is maybe the wrong word. We've said that I listen, I pay attention. Richard has given me a face. This is what I get for being here. You -- so we said that we'll hit about 30% by the end of the year, and I think we'll end up doing a little better than that. It is true that at this point, one of the limiting factors that we're working with is the timing of roll-off of our deposit contracts and the like that are also barriers as well as appropriate education of consumers. So I guess I would say that in general, the enhanced rates program is moving at or above the pace we have discussed. And we think that the end result of this is going to be both a higher for lack before neutral rate as well as ultimately less cyclicality because of the features that we've been able to to design into this product. And so I'm really excited about where we're headed with it. I'm excited to have Jim take a look at it and see where he can add and improve, and we'll have more to say about it as we go in the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies.\nGlen Santangelo: Just 2 quick ones for me. Jon, I was kind of curious if you can give us any update on the average duration of the portfolio and if that's changing at all with this enhanced rates product because I think as most of us are probably aware, I mean, and you are 3 years ago, today, the 10-year was sitting at 65, 70 basis points, right? So you're getting ready to do a replacement kind of coming up here in a few months. And I was kind of curious if you could help us in any way think about the waterfall. And then I just had a follow-up on margins.\nJon Kessler: Yes. I'm going to give you a lot of words that I'm not sure are going to answer the question you asked, okay?\nGlen Santangelo: So, let me just -- let me copy [ph].\nJon Kessler: In general, we have not made any change with regard to the fundamentally with regard to the approach we take to the duration of our cash portfolio. I think that's fundamentally what you're asking that is to say with -- and by cash, in particular, I mean our deposit portfolio, right? We deploy the actual contracts that are deployed or 4- or 5-year contracts. And when you kind of swizzle in the fact that there's variable rate cash and there's money above the minimums and whatnot, right? You're really talking about duration historically, and by duration here, I mean, liquidity-related duration that's around 3 years. Now so I think the premise is right. There are a couple of things that -- I mean -- and I think generally, the premise that your question, I think suggest that you have, Glenn, which is that over the next couple of years here, there's a lot of cash that will be running out of deposit contracts and particularly to the extent -- well, even if it were placed on new deposit contracts, but particularly the extent it's place enhanced rates, right, is going to produce a nice bump here and that will include all of the COVID re-cash [ph]. So you think about -- and that includes both the natural runoffs, but also the kind of roughly 5-year single placement associated with the timing of the wage conversions in calendar 2020, I believe. I may have that wrong, 20 or 21 one of the 2. But -- so there is a lot of opportunity here. We think it was absolutely the right time to be looking at whether the deposit instruments were really serving our needs and those of our members. And I think we've made the right choice in pursuing this mechanism. And look, the result is going to be under any reasonable economic scenario or any plausible economics not at the moment is going to be that it's not just that cyclically, we're going to see higher profits. It's that on an ongoing basis, we're going to see higher profits from the custodial line, and that seems good.\nGlen Santangelo: Right. I mean just to use your words, Jon, I mean, you said there's a bump comment, and I just want to make sure I'm correct in thinking there is a bump company even if you don't want to size it today because when we go back and we look at those consort of cash rates, I mean, it's pretty clear there's a big bump coming...\nJon Kessler: Yes. I mean, you -- as you well know, Glenn, when -- I think people got a little ahead of their skis at the beginning of calendar '23. And maybe -- and so I want to be thoughtful about not creating an even bigger on your skis to yard sell, but -- but I think -- but the premise is correct, and I think it will be sizeable.\nGlen Santangelo: All right. And maybe Tyson, just one quick one on the margins. I mean the EBITDA was up -- adjusted EBITDA was up 360 basis points year-over-year. And I know there was some membrane balance growth and the improvement in the custodial yields obviously and some technology benefits. But I was wondering if you could just real quickly sort of unpack that to help us think about what's really driving that better EBITDA when you think about those 3 contributors.\nTyson Murdock: Yes. I mean it is the custodial revenue obviously falling down to the model, and we knew that would drive it. And like we've talked about, you go back to history and way back, and we did hit a 40% EBITDA margin in one of the quarters in the middle of the summer, like this one. And so we're moving back towards that as that moves up. But I do think that we've been very thoughtful about how we've managed the controllable costs. And when I say that, I mean not something like stock comp, which is -- which we benchmark just fine with all of our peers, but it does get added back into EBITDA. What I'm talking about is what our executives work on every single day. And we're very thoughtful about how we build budgets and who we hire and how much we improve compensation and those types of things. And so, I think that's just a matter of the seriousness with which the team takes that and that's why we're able to raise our EBITDA guidance by 5% along with the top line. Normally, you see it as a percentage of that top line raise. So it's just being thoughtful about those efficiencies. I do think that it's also true that there's efficiencies to be gained and have been gained on the service cost line item. And that's again where a lot of the executives are working on that. And I think we've set ourselves up for longer-term success there as well, and it will start to show. And so I think those are some of the things that are sort of showing through on that. And I think we'll continue to get the benefit of the enhanced rate program, pushing down through there as well like we've been talking about. So that will continue for some time.\nGlen Santangelo: Awesome. And best luck, Tyson.\nTyson Murdock: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets.\nSean Dodge: Sure. Thanks. Maybe just going back to the enhanced product. And just to further clarify how those work. I know, Jon, you said you placed cash in those for 5 years, but you've also said before they're designed to produce more smoothness and yields over time. So does that mean -- should we think about these being more like a variable rate product? Or is that smoothness coming more from the fact that these are layered in over the course of the year and not all happening in lumps around the January time frame. And so as these roll kind of on their 5-year ladder, it's happening more intra-year instead of in January, and that's where the movement is coming from. Maybe just to help clarify that.\nJon Kessler: The answer is there are really 3 sources of this, and we thought quite a bit about this as we work through these products. The first is the second point you mentioned, that is to say the fact that money -- when you do cash -- I'm sorry, keep saying when you do deposits like you strike the deal and you send all the money, and that's it. Here, you do have the ability to layer money in kind of for lack of from dollar cost average in and out. And so that does really help. And at some point, we're not going to be talking about if we have our way, we're not going to be talking about tremendous uncertainty on this topic when we announced the December quarter and the like, and I'm sure you'll all look forward to that as we will. The second factor is that the variable cash that we need to maintain liquidity is built into the instrument. So in the bank instruments, right, yes, they have a minimum Max, but fundamentally, they still work like term deposits. And so we have a separate cash today about million or about 4% of our 3.5% of our total HSA cash that is in purely variable rate instruments, and we need to have it there because that protects us against any liquidity issues. And so the liquidity is built into the contract. And so that's very helpful in terms of eliminating situations where you have as occurred in March of 2020, very rapid changes in government policy and the like that produce big changes and particularly downward in variable rates. And then the third factor, which I guess will get into a little bit more, I'm sure this will be on the agenda when we get to Investor Day. But is some stuff that is internal, I'll just say, internal to the contracts that is just really designed to some extent, to provide a little bit of trade-off between rate and non-cyclicality. We really recognize that it's not in the interest of our investors nor is it valuable in terms of managing the business for people to start thinking about these dollars as anything other than what in the end they really are, which is fees, right? And when we've been -- when we're fully exposed to deposit products as we have been, though we've done everything in our power within that world to try and minimize that cyclicality, right? There's still -- particularly when you're close to rebound, there's quite a bit of it. And so that's the third factor. And again, we'll, I'm sure, go into details at some point. But take all these together, and it's not that there aren't going to be ups and downs, there are okay? But it should be the case, a, that we're at -- the more money that goes into these products, the higher the neutral rate will be. And second, the less variability there will be -- or the less variability there will be with short-term changes in interest rates.\nSean Dodge: Okay. And then you said -- so the goal is to transition 10%, give or take, of the deposits to these, it sounds like you're tracking at or slightly better than that. Is that still the way we should be thinking about that over the longer term? Or are there opportunities out there at some point to start to accelerate how quickly you transition cash [indiscernible]?\nJon Kessler: So what I’m asking me to tell you otherwise, that’s the way you should think about it. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Schoenhaus with Stephens.\nScott Schoenhaus: Guys, can you hear me? So congrats on Titan. It is also a pleasure working with you. Good welcome to your next adventure. So I just -- most of my questions have been asked. I just wanted to drill on on the service fee side. How much of that was driven -- the growth driven by -- I think you talked last quarter about slightly raised fees versus the underlying improvement in like commuter CERA, if you could break out any differentiation that would be great.\nJon Kessler: So if you look at it, service fees, particularly if you take the if you look at it, service fees, I believe, grew slightly faster than accounts than total accounts. And it's a little tricky because most service fees come from CDBs and the like. But I would say that the bigger issue here was just -- was volume driven. And we are starting to see some of the rate increases that we put out there and talked about in the first quarter, start to come through in actual collected revenues and the like. But I think you're going to see a little more of that, particularly as we get into the beginning of fiscal '25 as a critical factor. Of course, we also hope that volumes are up as well. But I think for the moment, what you're seeing is a little more volume driven on the top line.\nScott Schoenhaus: Great. That’s great color. And then just on the balance sheet, like $290 million of cash. Anything changing in the M&A environment versus 90 days ago?\nJon Kessler: We commented 90 days ago that we felt like kind of given the proximity to the deposit crisis on the bank side that yields weren't likely. And that's why we went ahead. And if you recall, back at the end of April, started to -- we did a partial paydown on our term A. We sort of just did the math and it made sense. But I should say Tyson did the math and then he showed it to me, and I said no, like 5 times and he kept showing it to me, and he was right. But I think that with a little bit of distance from that, it's -- we are seeing a little bit of that. You've seen some transactions announced primarily in areas where the HSA is a piece of the business but not the whole of the business, and those generally are transactions that we're going to do at this point. But so you've seen a few of those. I think also in truth, the fact that things like the move to enhance rates, the increased investment that we're making and presumably others who want to be competitive, will make too all those factors raise barriers to staying in the market. And so I do think that it's possible that over the next while, you will see 1 or 2 of the larger players. I don't think the very top of the bracket, but in that area, break free, and we're pleased to be in a position to be ready to do those transactions. And the nice thing about them, as you know, is that from a shareholder perspective, we've done a number of these. We know we don't need any kind of bank or multiple magic to make them work. It's -- we look at the IRR. And if the IRR works, we can do it. And from a cash flow and leverage perspective, these portfolio type transactions start cash flowing on day 1, and you're not having to muck around with synergies and all that we've dealt with in other transactions, but not in this type. So I guess I would say, that's just a long way to say, I think it's incrementally a little bit better. But I think particularly on the smaller transactions, like just plain old bank transfers that occur a little less -- still less of those. I think the small banks got a pretty good scare. And I think they're still pretty scared.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Allen Lutz with Bank of America.\nAllen Lutz: I guess one for Tyson. As we look at the custodial revenue and I went back and looked at custodial revenue really since the IPO, and it goes up basically every quarter, only in fiscal '21 didn't really ever dip. But I guess I wanted to talk about the components of the about $4.5 million increase sequentially in custodial revenue in the quarter. Can you just talk about what are some of the drivers of that? And then should we see some of those sequential drivers impact revenue going from 2Q to 3Q this year?\nTyson Murdock: Yes. I mean we have some deposits that occur in the middle of the year, which are smaller, Alan. So we make adjustments there. And as we feed money into enhanced rates as well, kind of operating we've got to make sure we operate between the mid and the MAX on the deposits on the FDIC side, but we could start to continue to feed dollars into the enhanced rate program. You see that start to accelerate as well. And so as Jon said, we're a little ahead of schedule on our goals there, too. So that's part of the steroid story. We've also continued to do a little bit better on how we monetize client-held funds against the rate environment that's currently available to us. And so we make a little bit of improvement there. And I give credit. We got a new -- we got a new treasurer in there. He's making improvements and looking for ways to squeeze more times and nickels out of this, and clearly, he's doing a good job. And so it's kind of all those things amalgamated together.\nJon Kessler: One thing, if you're doing a year-on-year comparison, this is what I'm doing, Richard's bidding, and I expect to be I expect that to be noted since I don't mostly do what Richard tells me to -- but good for a compliment. I'm just looking for acknowledge that occasional positive importance is that in last year, 2 things happened that I think are -- you're not going to see this year, and they happened in tandem. One is, obviously, rates took off, variable rates took off from 0. So the variable component was -- in percentage terms was a big boost that we didn't see coming at the beginning of the year. and where I should say, certainly wasn't there. And then second, and tied to that, we began this effort that the Tyson referenced about generating custodial income from the CDB side of the business. And that was a lot of work over the course of a couple of years since the WageWorks transaction because that's where most of that CD CDB funds come from. And yet there wasn't a real sorry to start it up because marginal rates were roughly 0. And so you won't have that same ramp this year. So if someone's doing a year-on-year comparison, I think the better way to do that is to look at -- you just -- you can look at where things are now, you can add whatever cash you think you can add to the current pile and take our rate guidance for what it is, and you'll have a pretty good view of what things are going to be for -- the rate guidance obviously implies about 10 basis points higher in the second half. And so the math is not that arcade.\nAllen Lutz: Very well done, Jon. Thank you. Finally, now I can dive in one quick one -- one quick last one. So Jon, you talked about new logo growth and expanded network partner footprint as kind of supporting the growth for HealthEquity? And then you talked about a 10% market growth rate. I guess as you think about some of the wins you're seeing this year, new logo growth, if I'm a prospective customer, what is the impetus to change or to switch vendors this year? Is there something different that's driving more customers to switch? Or is it just kind of more of the same?\nJon Kessler: I think -- and now we're getting into the realm of like speculation informed by data, which is the most dangerous kind. But I think there's 2 things that are happening. And I would invite Steve to comment on this as well. The first is that I do think it's probably fair to say that there are some HR departments that are coming out of the pandemic, and in particular, coming out in a period where they've already now seen 1 year of inflation and its impact on the wage side, but they didn't see it much of an impact on the benefit side until this year, and now they're seeing it. So there's a little more attention being paid to benefit design and do I have the right vendor mix to optimize what I'm trying to do on the benefit side. And I think we're a great partner in that environment. And then I think the second factor is that it's becoming somewhat clear who's in this thing to win it. And I think there's -- the number of firms that are really there to do that is somewhat smaller than it was. But maybe, Steve, you -- as I say, Steve spends Healthcare. He spends more time in airplanes than I do almost doing anything. So you're as qualified as I speak to what's going on out there.\nSteve Neeleman: Jon nailed that, Alan, if you just go back to the history, right, we did the wage deal right before Covid and Covet hit everyone. And look, we -- it took us a while to get everything lined up and integrated and getting the teams working together and regaining frankly trust from brokers and consultants and large employers and things like that, that we could execute with the much bigger company going from 900 HealthEquity teammates to 3,500 as after the acquisition to really be able to nail it. And I think we've regained a lot of that trust back candidly. And whether it's the trust of an HR professional that knows that to make a big -- it's a big deal, right, to move 5,000, 10,000 or even 50,000 or 0 or 1,000 of their folks over they have to close the accounts, that's reopen new ones, everything. They have to be pretty sure that they're going to the right solution. And so I mean, I think the great thing about HealthEquity is, is that our service has always been highly regarded. We were able to do a lot of these integrations and things like that. And now I think if you really talk to the market, you talk to the consultants, talk to large employers, small employers, midsized -- and of course, all of our health and partners, they really believe that we're hitting our stride from a service perspective, which makes it a lot easier to make those kind of changes when you don't need to worry about just systems not working and things like that. So I think we're very well positioned. And then more macro Jane spoke to the fact that when you're just trying to hire people and you're dealing with red resignation and a great transfer and all the other stuff, and now it's a little more of a rhythm to people's benefits. Now is a good time to kind of say, all right, tend to start looking at where we can really drive some deeper adoption of health savings accounts and things like that. And they know that we're the proven leader in that space of really helping their workforce embrace health savings accounts.\nJon Kessler: Thanks, Allen.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Tyson, I'll echo the positive settlement has been great working with you. I guess, Jon, 2 quick ones for me, and I'll try to keep it brief. First, as you talked about the enterprise pipeline being robust. I don't know if there's any way you can quantify that or throw some numbers around it? And kind of what's the strategy to gain share as we go through the upcoming selling season? And then I'll pause and come back for the second one.\nJon Kessler: Yes. I got out of the game of giving sales pipeline numbers, and I'm not going to get back into it -- two in one day. But let me say, from a strategy perspective briefly, this isn't rocket science. We are the market leader across this bundle. And we're good people, and we have -- if you were -- we're not going to like throw up NPS numbers and the like. But if you look -- were to look at that data, you would see that where I think others have been a little more challenged over the last year or two, particularly this last year, the team just busted its but and delivered -- and I'm not using this word likely a remarkable open enrollment season. And if you think about the way enterprise works, a lot of those enterprise deals start during -- they kind of start -- the sales cycle starts at the end of the prior year, and people can do things like they can call your call center in January and see how long the wait is and see whether people are harried or not and all those kind of things. And so those things matter. And then lastly, George, I'll say, from a strategy perspective we are -- and we are showing our clients where we are spending on cashing my ships here, Richard, on the Tecatand people are seeing what we're doing. It's not like they're not -- as you know, as do press releases for features or clients, so that's not what we do, right? But folks who are looking at our road map, we're looking what comes out every month or so, who are looking -- and you'll see some of this over the course of the next 6 months. But but there's really neat and interesting stuff going on. And what it basically just conveys is that, again, back to an earlier comment that we're at a place of that relative to some of our competitors and certainly relative to other segments, we are very fortunate to be in a place where we can invest at a time we're investing in the infrastructure, in the technology, in feature function, in product, actually matters versus a period where there's not that much new happening. And so I think the enterprise that really gets to pay attention to that, whereas the small groups kind of don't. They're seeing that. And I think you're going to see it too over the course of the next year or so.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. That’s helpful. And I think I knew you weren’t going to give me an answer to the pipeline question, so I have a follow-up, which I also – I’m not sure that you’ll give me an answer to. But given that we talked about kind of the average – well, I know that the company historically is not – you guys don’t think of yourself as in the business of prognosticating rates. However, people in my business are in the business of prognosticating rates. And given where we are in the rate cycle, do you guys ever think about proactively trying to extend duration? Because I imagine a lot of people in my business if we’re looking out 3 years, we probably think the next rate move is down versus up. So just kind of like is there anything that you guys are seeing in the rate environment that kind of makes you want to change the way that you guys think about how you kind of put that custodial cash to work and duration and timing.\nJon Kessler: Yes. So I'm going to give you an answer that is only slightly different than I've given to this question before, but the slide is probably relevant. Let me first say the answer we generally give is that we -- from the perspective of the instruments and the duration of the instruments in which we have invested in the HA cash world, we've not -- exactly as you say, we've not been prognosticators and we've tried to generally hold aggregate duration for liquidity in that kind of 3-, 4-year range. I will say one of the benefits of the enhanced rates product, one of the features that allows us to have some trade-off around this is that we can meet our liquidity needs while the instruments in the portfolio are somewhat longer-term instruments. And so while that wasn't particularly designed with a moment like this one in mind, a practical effect of it is to the extent that we're placing funds, whether it's at the end of the last cycle or in this cycle and towards the end of this cycle, not by cycle, I mean, year and so forth, we're going to be locking in that context, higher yields on those placements for an extended period of time. And so I do -- again, I want to be thoughtful and cautious in saying that. First of all, when managing the company in expenses, we think about neutral rates because like spending into -- and honestly, we're not actually at neutral yet if you think about it. But I do think there is a practical effect of the way we're doing this is that it is going to produce more benefit from this cycle than we've seen from prior cycles or than we would see if we were just using our same deposit instruments that we have in the past.\nGeorge Hill: That was relevant and helpful.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Yes. First of all... You don't want Macron -- [indiscernible].\nMark Marcon: Tyson, it’s been a pleasure working with you. In terms of serious questions, just on the yield moving up so much on the cash, was that partially just due to the enhanced yield product is becoming a bigger portion of the overall deal? Because obviously, Fed funds doesn’t fully explain it. So I just wanted to 100% clarify that?\nJon Kessler: Yes. In addition, I would say, during this period, to the extent we had any bank placements, and they would have been small. We've talked about before that the bank placement market is very favorable right now. \nMark Marcon: Great. And then if we take a look at investments, I mean, 23% growth in terms of the investments there. Obviously, there’s been an impact with regards to the overall market. But what are you seeing just in terms of the behavior of the holders? Are they starting to chase additional yield even through like intermediate bond products or anything along that line? Are you seeing any sort of movement from that perspective? And how should we think about that?\nJon Kessler: Yes. Thank you for asking that question, Mark. We -- our portfolio offering does include things like ultrashort bond funds, that kind of behave in the same manner as money market, but I think don't fuzz the distinction between insured by the federal government and not insured by the federal government. And so as sometimes you see with some of what our other folks in the marketplace might do. I don't think they intend to, but it's the practical effect. So -- and those funds have been quite popular. So I do think there's an element of this that is investor that is members saying, \"You know what, I'd like to get more yield than I can get on cash. I know I'm not going to do anything with it. Let me put it in at least today, tomorrow, I'm willing to give up the clarity of I can swipe my card or whatever, and I'll put it in some of these products. I think there's some of that. I also think that the -- every day, there's an article in the paper that's -- you can decide what the motivation is, but it's like yes, those 5% CD yields are great, but it still doesn't beat the stock market over the long term. And so there's some of that, too. But I think it's probably fair to say that there's an element, and that's a win from our perspective in that -- well, sure, on that incremental dollar, we might earn more if it were sitting in cash. That's a customer that's going to be more sticky. We're giving them the product they want. We try to guide them to exactly the product that they're asking for. If they're getting capital A advice from us, that's part of the discussion. I mean it's -- I just think at the end of the day -- and it -- while our -- the rates we pay on cash are determined from a formula, nonetheless, it's probably the availability of those products in part that has allowed not just us, but the broader industry to kind of keep a lid on custodial expense. And so I guess I sort of think that's a win. That's how I think about it.\nOperator: One question today comes from David Larsen at BTIG.\nDavid Larsen: Congrats on a good quarter. And Tyson, it was great working with you. I thought you did a great job guiding the company through a very, very tough cycle. Can you maybe just talk about either Jon or Tyson, the revenue delta on interchange 1Q versus 2Q, it's obviously down about 13%. And just any more clarity around like the COBRA impact? And if you can describe what exactly that was, that would be very helpful.\nJon Kessler: Tyson, you want to hit Part A of that…\nTyson Murdock: Yes. On the interchange, David, I mean, that's just the normal seasonality. So we've got people essentially spending as they've loaded up the HSA accounts in the first part of the year, they're going to spend more. And then as we move into the summer months, they're going to spend less as they're not home spending actually. And so we always get that seasonality through. So you'll see a Q1 high point, you'll see a Q2, Q3 softer point. And then as we move into Q4, you've got the use it or lose it and you've got kind of the remaining funds on those CDB accounts that get used up. And so you see a stronger Q4, and that's why you see that. And so that seasonality is look a little funny in history. So it is hard to decipher that because the cover effect over quarters in history now, it doesn't look as smooth as just that seasonality, I explained. So that's kind of one thing. And then Jon, you're going to hit the oversight of it and less David has on a roll.\nJon Kessler: Yes. And on the COBRA side of it, that's just -- again, we've got -- we've mentioned in the script a little bit of the legislative effect of that. And so with regards to FSD and Cobra, this that's been tough to forecast all the way through having the national emergency legislation out there. And with regards to COBRA, just the fact that people don't have the optionality to go into COBRA multiyear after exiting a job, that changes how we essentially drive revenue off of the different communications that we make to them and also just the number of people that sign up, given the, I think, even the broader strength in the economy that maybe wasn't expected. So those are kind of the things that kind of push those things around.\nDavid Larsen: Okay, great. And then I think what I’m hearing also is that in terms of like the risk of a recession or the risk of a slowdown next year, you’re not seeing any of that in terms of demand. In fact, it’s kind of the exact opposite. There’s lots of demand, you’re signing up a bunch of clients. Is that right?\nJon Kessler: I mean I don't know that our clients in the human resources department are experts at predicting recessions. But I think people are -- I think it's probably fair to say that what's happening out there is that people are anticipating tighter conditions, whether that's a recession or not, I don't know. But the effect of anticipating tighter conditions is there is that they're attentive to plan design and win-wins and things like that, that we talked about earlier in the call. So -- but in terms of -- when I look at the account numbers that change as a result of that are a function just of new job adds and the like, I mean, our data are moving in tandem with the national data at this point. So I think there's nothing that would surprise you there.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. And then I think you basically renegotiate your contracts every 3 years with your clients, which I think would imply that the yields that drive custodial revenue should continue to increase through next year, right?\nJon Kessler: I would refer back to the answer on that one to -- I think it was Glenn that asked a similar question. And just -- but just to say, our duration is 3, but our bigger contracts, the deposit contracts themselves, maybe 4 or 5 years. So there's -- you're going to see quite a few of these come through over the next couple of years. And also during, obviously, the last few years, there's been quite a bit of growth. So you need to -- if you look at this, you need to go back to your reference year versus dividing today by that number.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. And – and when you say you’ll see quite a few of these in a favorable manner, I think, is what you were saying around…\nJon Kessler: Yes.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. And then just lastly for me. Your service gross margin obviously showed some pretty good improvement. You got as high as like, I think, 38% in 2Q of ‘22. How high can your service gross margin trend to?\nJon Kessler: We've talked about this in the past. I don't -- I'm not able to make like long-run predictions. What I will say is we're targeting the total margin and particularly as we reduce the cyclicality of the other components, I think that makes a ton of sense. So I -- but I do think we have some room to grow from here. I mean we ought to be able, over time, to get this number back into the 30s. It may take us a little while, but the drivers of that are going to be, first of all, particularly growth in the CDB businesses that are profitable. And then secondly, the underlying HSA account growth and then third is going to be ServiceTech where we can bring cost down. And we've delivered a little bit of that in this quarter and a little bit of last quarter. And heck, we do a little out each quarter. And at the end of this, we'll have a software business, I don't know. I'm just kidding that won't be true, but it is an opportunity.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sandy Draper Guggenheim.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much. Not a lot left to ask. So first, I'll just say we'll also echo Tyson. It's been a pleasure working with you. Hopefully, we'll get to cross path at some point in the future. I guess the first question, if I just do the simple math of looking at the cash per account, it's down a touch. I know that's just a 1-day comparison last quarter to this quarter. Just trying to think because you have much more visibility, and this sort of ties to what you're saying, Jon, about the investments. Is there any notable change in behavior you're seeing now versus maybe the past couple of years about the desire for people to pay themselves back versus put the money in and not reimburse themselves. That would be the first question.\nJon Kessler: Now I have to ask how many they're going to be because after -- I'm just glad Greg is already off the line to hear all these like 8 partners. No, I'm kidding, but here goes. Look, I think, first of all, it is worth noting that if you look at total assets for the quarter, this was actually a record growth period ex Q4s. I mean you're talking about close to $1 billion in asset growth over the course of a single quarter, and that's really good. Also, if I break it down, and I think that the short answer here is going to be that I don't think there's been very much difference other than the -- as we talked about in an earlier question, the increased interest in investment, no pun intended. Because if you look at Q2 contributions, they're up year-over-year exactly as you would expect. And it's just that the transfers from cash to investments were way up. And I think that just reflects -- it ultimately reflects a better market backdrop. I mean if I look at the same period a year ago, the S&P was off 13%. And during this period, it was plus about the same number a little bit more. And so the better market backdrop and all that kind of stuff. But the underlying contribution behavior, which is, I think, really the thing you would care about was kind of about the same. Spend was seasonally pretty much what we expected. So I don't think it's any fundamental change in spend behavior.\nSandy Draper: Okay, great. And then if Steve hasn't gotten board and dropped off, maybe a quick one for him. You commented on the environment around sales. But Steve, you are man on the ground in D.C. anything coming out that you're going to come out of D.C., whether it's regarding Medicare potential bigger step-ups and potential ability for people to invest or save in HSAs, anything new out of DC? Or is it really nothing going on there right now?\nSteve Neeleman: Thanks, Sandy. And I think on this very day, there's nothing going on in D.C. But they are coming back, we continue to have some fantastic discussions. And I think what kind of is different is that now these are more bipartisan. And we're just kind of focusing on what do Americans need and whether it's loosening up a little bit on some of the qualifying attributes around the higher plan you've been around long enough, and thank you for your support over the years to remember that there was a lot of lack of clarity around things like preventative care, right? And that was actually clarified under the Trump administration that allowed people to start paying for more medications for installers and things like that and still have a high up plan. That helps. And so that was not only to help that they introduced it, but then the bit administration has been very supportive of those and then change it also. So now when you look at -- especially the large employers and then plans are offered by health funds, and you look at their benefit design, they are covering things like high blood pressure meds and diabetic meds and stuff like that as allowed by regulation. So I think that has actually cloud a little bit of the ground that we're trying to do, which is to say, all right, we all agree that every American needs what we would refer to as soon one that can work with any plan, obviously, with the Hyve plan, we know that it's the HSA, but is there -- are there other mechanisms to try and do that. And so I just -- I'm encouraged by the bipartisan nature of the discussions and despite everything that everyone sees when they turn on, they're given news station and how they think it's so torn apart. I haven't seen that when I talked to Democrats and Republicans in Congress. And so we are hopeful that we'll continue to see some -- what we refer to as HSA or other type of account expansion, allowing just more Americans to have the benefits of one of these portable personally owned investable accounts and kind of plan the they have. So that's what we've been focused on. It's just saying how can we expand that. But yes, I mean, let's -- thanks for the question. I believe we're continuing to make progress, and we're hopeful that certainly before the next presidential election, there will be some bills and truths that can continue to expand the benefit. So we will make sure that as legislators made these decisions, and they started -- they start to disseminate that information out, then we will pass along, but it's just a constant educational game. So thanks, and make sure your musical talent over the years, too. I always appreciate your musical down.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jon Kessler for closing remarks.\nJon Kessler: So I appreciate everyone in the kind comments for Tyson for all he takes are teasing really well, always has and is going to be genuinely missed within the organization. But like I think this is not going to be the last time most of you on this call will see Mr. Murdoch or her Mr. Murdoch and certainly will not be the last time I hear or see him. And we'll see how this leukemia guy does. It's -- but one way to find out is to book your flights now for February 22 2024. This is big time. This is all like -- I mean, we're talking about Broadway quality type stuff. Actually, I have no...\nSteve Neeleman: But I do know this. Jon, can I…\nJon Kessler: Yes.\nSteve Neeleman: I want to interject one thing on that. So look, we think we'll have a good winter. And we would love to not only guide you through our business, but maybe do some mountain guiding. And maybe we can bring Tyson back to help us be one of the guys. I felt the thank Tyson as well. Tyson, thank you. You've been a wonderful teammate, and thank you for everything you've done for HealthEquity.\nJon Kessler: Thanks, everybody. I really appreciate it. All right. That's it. We'll see you all in December, and some of you before then, and then, of course, in February.\nTyson Murdock: Thank you.\nSteve Neeleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everybody. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome. I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Putnam to HealthEquity’s Earnings Call. Please go ahead.\nRichard Putnam: Thank you, Sara. Hello, everyone. Welcome to HealthEquity's first quarter of fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Richard Putnam, Investor Relations for HealthEquity and joining me today on the call is Jon Kessler, President and CEO, Dr. Steve Neeleman, our Vice Chair and Founder of the company, and Tyson Murdock, the company's Executive Vice President and CFO. Before I turn the call over to Jon, I have two important reminders. First, a press release announcing our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was issued after the market close this afternoon. The financial results included contributions from our wholly owned subsidiaries and accounts they administer. The press release also includes definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference today. A copy of today's press release, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures and a recording of this webcast can be found on our Investor Relations website, which is ir.healthequity.com. Second, our comments and responses to your questions today reflect management's view as of today, June 5, 2023, and will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. There are many important factors relating to our business, which could affect the forward-looking statements made today. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from statements made here today. We caution against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we also encourage you to review the discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock as detailed inour annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for Q&A with the help of our operator Sara. One final announcement before we hear from Jon, due to some conflicts recently encountered, we are postponing our Investor Day that was planned for July 11, to be at a later to be announced date. Once we have rescheduled the date, we will provide you with the press release and invitation. Now, over to you, Jon.\nJon Kessler: Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a healthy start to fiscal 2024. I will discuss Q1 key metrics and our view on performance, and Tyson will detail Q1 results, as well as our raised guidance for the fiscal year, and Steve is here for Q&A. In Q1, the team delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, which was plus 19%, adjusted EBITDA, which was plus 48%, and HSA assets which were plus 10%. HSA members grew 9%, total accounts grew 4% muted by the previously discussed change in COBRA methodology. HealthEquity ended Q1 with 15 million total accounts, 8 million HSAs and 22 billion in HSA assets, all kind of round numbers, and 10% more of our HSA members became investors year-over year, invested assets grew 12%, despite a dicey market. Team Purple started the selling year off strong with 134,000 new HSAs opened during the quarter, that's down 25,000 year-over-year and we expected a drop given the comp to last Q1's blistering job growth and turnover rates economy wide, but we're particularly pleased actually that, that was nearly offset by new employer adds, including across the board for HSAs. In addition, at this time last year, we saw transfers of HSAs from banks that were exiting the business. Obviously, this year, and given the competition for cash, we did not see that same activity. Enterprise logo wins that will onboard later in the year were up noticeably year-over-year, driven by an expanded net partner footprint and employers seeking win-wins in anticipation of a tough calendar ‘24 benefits renewal. For the full-year, we are increasingly confident that increased HSA adoption at the employer level will help to offset lower macro job growth. Q1 saw some daylight on CDV growth, our CDV members grew accounts in the quarter by excluding COBRA as a whole by 4% and by 1%, if you simply exclude the aforementioned adjustment of COBRA accounting methodology. Health CDVs, FSAs and HRAs were strong, as the onboarding of significant new logos offset some seasonal runoffs, commuter maintained its slow rebound, extra ACA exchange subsidies continue to negatively impact COBRA uptake and therefore activity fees and to compensate for that, the team has begun raising fixed fees with good early success, which is very much needed. While there's much wood to chop on service fees, service costs actually fell by 40 basis points year-over-year, even as revenue increased despite wage gains for our team members as we benefited from a much calmer service environment versus a year ago quarter. As we discussed last quarter, rapid improvement in service tech continues to drive more interactions to chat and automated responses and we believe there is more to come of this over the longer term. Q1 also provided a preview of what we believe is to come over the longer term with respect to custodial fields -- fees as -- fields -- fees is like fields plus yields that will be fields, good luck with that transcriber. As yields on our ladder bank deposit portfolio rose out of the COVID debts and more members chose enhanced rates for or chose enhanced rates for their HSA cash. You saw the strength of our model over the course of the quarter as we talked about in March. High short-term rates provided a boost to income on CDB client health loans as well. All of this adds -- added up to strong and resilient cash flow from operations, which as Tyson will detail, led to a return to GAAP profitability in Q1, allowed management to reduce outstanding -- which allowed management to reduce outstanding balance on HealthEquity’s variable rate term loan A debt and enables us to continue to invest in future growth and innovation. Mr. Murdock will now detail the financial results and outlook.\nTyson Murdock: Thank you, Jon. I will highlight our first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and a reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures is found in today's press release. First quarter revenue increased 19% year-over-year. Service revenue was $105.1 million, up 1% year-over-year and custodial revenue grew 59% to $94.4 million in the first quarter. The annualized interest rate yield on HSA cash was 232 basis points. Interchange revenue grew 7% to $44.9 million. Gross margin was 60% in the first quarter this year versus 54% in the year ago period. Net income for the first quarter was $4.1 million or $0.05 per share on a GAAP EPS basis. Our non-GAAP net income was $42.8 million for the first quarter and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.50 per share, compared to $0.27 per share last year. While higher interest rates increased custodial yields and generated interest income, they also increased the rate of interest we pay on the remaining $287 million term loan A to a stated rate of 6.6%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $86.6 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, a more than 700 basis point improvement over last year. Turning to the balance sheet, as of April 30, 2023, we used $54 of cash to reduce our outstanding variable debt resulting in a quarter end balance of $226 million of cash and cash equivalents with $873 million of debt outstanding net of issuance costs. We continue to have an undrawn $1 billion line of credit available. For fiscal ‘24, we're raising guidance and now expect the following, revenue in a range between $975 million and $985 million. GAAP net income to be in the range of $9 million to $14 million. We expect non-GAAP net income to be between $164 million and $171 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted net income between $1.88 and $1.97 per share based upon an estimated 87 million shares outstanding for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $333 million and $343 million. As Jon mentioned, we are basing fiscal ‘24 interest rate assumptions, embedded in guidance on forward-looking market indicators, such as the secured overnight financing rate and mid-duration treasury forward curves and fed funds futures. We are raising the expected average yield on HSA cash to approximately 235 basis points for fiscal ‘24, while the average credit rating or HAS members receive on -- the average credit rating HSA -- rates on HSA members receive on HSA cash remained flat sequentially. We continue to bake in a 20 basis point increase by the end of fiscal ‘24. As a reminder, the crediting rate, our HSA members receive are determined in accordance with the formula in our facility agreements with them. Our guidance also reflects the expectation of higher average interest rates on HealthEquity's variable rate debt versus last year, partially offset by the reduced amount of variable rate debt outstanding. Our guidance includes a smoother, seasonal cadence of revenue and earnings, which were disrupted last year by heavier first-half service costs, as we exited the pandemic and also the rapidly rising rate environment that benefited last year's second-half disproportionately. We expect that interchange revenue seasonally would be more normalized this year and as suggested earlier, a relatively stable interest rate environment over the remainder of this year. We assume a projected statutory income tax rate of approximately 25% and a diluted share count of 87 million, which now includes common share equivalents as we anticipate positive GAAP net income this year. Moving to positive GAAP net income is going to impact our GAAP tax strangely this year. As you know, because of the impact of discrete tax items, the calculated tax rate on a low level of pretax income can look squarely, such as Q1's calculated 59% tax rate. Based on our current full-year guidance, we expect roughly a 50% GAAP tax rate for fiscal ‘24. As we've done in recent reporting periods, our full fiscal 2024 guidance includes a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP metrics provided in the earnings release and a definition of all such items is included at the end of the earnings release. In addition, while the amortization of acquired intangible assets is being excluded from non-GAAP net income, the revenue generated from those acquired intangible assets is not excluded. And with that, we now have a -- we know you'll have a number of questions, so let's go right to our operator for Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGlen Santangelo: Yes, thanks and good evening and thanks for taking the question. Hey, Tyson, I just had a couple of quick financial questions, if I could, just to sort of help us sort of model this thing more correctly. It says now that you have total HSA assets of $14. 1 billion could you give us a sense for how much of that fits in variable and maybe how much of it you're investing in? Is it still a third, a third, a third, is that the right way to think about it? And the reason I ask is because we're trying to assess not only this year, but next year and I know you don't want to comment on fiscal ’25, but at the current yield curve, it sort of looks like the yield would be even much more year-over-year in ’25 versus ‘24. Nice one, you don't know if I'm thinking about that math correctly and I'll stop there. Thanks.\nTyson Murdock: Yes, good question. So the variable interest rate portion, of course, is getting smaller with the enhanced rate push. We don't need as much of that, so there's not as much impacting. Another thing to consider is the fact that, obviously, the rates last year accelerated so substantially over the course of the year that the second-half was impacted by that -- on that variable component. So people got very concerned about, well, how much of that variable component. But based on the size of that amount, it's not very big. And it's going to be obviously more consistent even though you may see a curve that sort of curves down. So that's kind of one area. The next is a question that we get, when you think about how the assets run through the model. Again, they get more consistent as we move into enhanced rates and that has its own liquidity factors. But you think you're thinking about the FDIC portion, which of course is lumpy because of the M&A that occurred over all those years. So think back about the WageWorks Acquisition, the Further Acquisition and those type of things. And the fact that as we go through integration processes on those, we place those assets into five-year contracts. And so they have to sit in those five-year contracts for five years. And then that causes as when you look back over time, you probably get a smaller amount that rolls off in this next year than you might think when you think about maybe what you mentioned, which is the one-third, one-third, one-third, based on sort of the three-year duration you might get off of those five-year placements. So what I'm telling you is that the number is smaller than that one-third. You have to go back quite back in time, even prior to the acquisition, to determine sort of what that -- prior to those big acquisitions to look at what that looks like. And so it will be a smaller number. So Jon, I don't know if you want to make any additional comments to that.\nJon Kessler: We I was keep going. We'll see what we here. Thanks, Glen.\nGlen Santangelo: Thank you, very much.\nJon Kessler: I will say that was just for other analyst benefit. That was a one-part question. That wasn't a four-part because we're not starting with the four-parters. First off, Glen, I was going to pull -- I don't know, some other analysts do does four, five part questions. Sorry, I'm sorry, Sarah. I didn’t mean to interrupt.\nOperator: Alright. No problem. Our next question comes from Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, I just want to make sure I called this correctly. You said you're increasing service fees that your employers are paying, and it seems like you're early in that. Can you just give us thoughts on the methodology? And how long do you expect until everybody is on board with the new pricing?\nJon Kessler: Well, in particular, that comment refers and now Tyson is chuckling at me because we had a small bet about whether anyone would ask about this, which I just lost -- so thank you for asking. But what I was really commenting on there was, in particular, this is several quarters where COBRA has been a bit of a drag for us. And although I will say overall, we were glad to see a black number on CDB and an almost crookedy looking black number on CDB ex COBRA. So that was pretty good. But my comment was focused on COBRA. And there, the real issue is that we now have in place for several more years now, incremental subsidies, sort of, sometimes humorously referred to as it's the extra Affordable Care Act. I think that's by the proponents of these things. And they were originally put in place from the pandemic, but they've been extended for a couple of years. And the result of that is lower COBRA uptick. So that doesn't necessarily change the offer rates, but it does affect what we call activity fees in COBRA. And so naturally, the way we should be making up for that is increasing the service fee component. And like all of our products, COBRA is sold both directly and through our channel partners, in particular, in this case, our health care partners. So we want to work with them carefully, but we have begun to roll out modest fee increases for the service fee component to, kind of, make up that difference. And I think people understood that, that was kind of coming, because the service -- the cost of delivering service hasn't fundamentally changed. So it's really focused on COBRA. And again, the idea isn't that this is going to drive some major magic, but we do want the overall CDB growth number from a revenue and so forth perspective to ultimately be a black number. It's not going to be the driver of our growth, but we don't want it to be dragging us again.\nStan Berenshteyn: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, and I don't know if you have any money on this. But just back to your prepared remarks, I think you commented that you had more focus on chat-based communications. Can you maybe just give us an update on the adoption of text-based communications within your member base? And then maybe related to that, are you seeing any opportunities to enhance member communication with maybe like generative AI technology that's coming up? Thanks.\nJon Kessler: So I don't think there was money on either of these. By was there is a -- there are a number of wagers around whether the term -- those two initials that you just mentioned would appear out of my mouth. And I'm going to see if I can -- like it's more whether I can get through without it more than anything else. Let's find out. But let's say this in all seriousness, I do think that it's fair to say that for us and others, the advances in these areas have really accelerated our ability to automate communications on a lot of the more basic queries that we get and deliver ultimately what from the member's perspective is rated to be a superior experience. So we have seen -- if you were to look at a chart of text-based and then automated text-based over the course of the last, really, six or eight months, it has gone up quite a bit. Both have gone up. I believe and I may be off here, but in rough turns right now, one out of every six or seven of our transactions is text-based. And of those transactions with our members’ interactions, of those between one out of three, and almost one out of two are automated. And so yes, the new stuff is helping, and I think it's going to help. I mean the nature of my commentary is, again, if you look at service cost, service costs fell year-over-year. Now there are some other things going on as I acknowledged in the script. Last year's comp was -- let's say last year first quarter service cost was not good. So that certainly helped. But even if you factor that out, we did very well. And so I think there's a lot more to come here in terms of our ability to both simultaneously improve member experience and reduce costs on the service line.\nStan Berenshteyn: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, Stan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anne Samuel with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnne Samuel: Hey, thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Jon, you spoke earlier in your prepared remarks about your strength in new employee adds for HSAs kind of coming in a little bit better than you had expected. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. What are you seeing? Is it labor growth, better enrollment. What's driving that?\nJon Kessler: So interesting, in our expectation, as I suggested in the prepared remarks, was, and we've tried to communicate this for quite a while, was that when -- was that we really were benefiting from both growth in the labor market and turnover in the labor market. And in fact, if you look at last year, sort of the variance year-over-year with the exception of Q4, kind of maybe including Q4, kind of came down as turnover in the economy kind of came down and job growth kind of relative to Q1 of last year kind of came down. So now turning to this first quarter, I mean the way I look at it is that, basically, the growth of new logos, meaning at this point in the year, mostly smaller employers that would be starting in February, March, April, a few holdovers from January that were late, that kind of thing. But those numbers almost offset the reduction in what I would call kind of purely organic, same employer growth relative to last year. And so that's pretty good when you think about the fact that in the economy as a whole, we're producing jobs at about 55%. It's still extraordinary, but we're producing jobs at about 55% of the rate that we did last Q1, this Q1. And I don't know what's shaking or if you all can hear that shaking. But hopefully, it's nothing. Oh, I do know it's shaking. It's a big drill. We got an interesting scene outside. But -- and also, when you consider that turnover, particularly voluntary turnover, has declined in the economy as a whole pretty significantly, and so we feel pretty good about that. We did have fewer transfers of HSAs from smaller banks, as you might imagine, folks trying to hang on to those accounts in a period where banks have been trying to hang on to deposits, and that accounted for the biggest portion of the delta year-over-year. So I guess my basic view is that if you look at the full year, we have some level of confidence that new logo growth is going to be sufficient to, if not fully offset, at least significantly offset what are -- what we expect to be a reduction in the strength of the labor market in the course of the year. And so that was meant to be a statement of confidence and, hopefully, will be interpreted that way.\nAnne Samuel: That’s great to hear. Thank you.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, Anne.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good evening, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Jon, this might be kind of a dovetailed question on Anne's question that was just asked. But I thought I heard you say in your prepared commentary that you're seeing increased HSA adoption at the employer level that will kind of offset job growth. So I guess my question is like, are you guys seeing an underlying change in the adoption of HSA levels that is kind of different from the historical trend of them growing 3%-ish a year? And would be interested to hear you talk about what's driving that like in the underlying adoption rate.\nJon Kessler: It's early in the year, obviously. And -- but when you look at our, I guess, conceptually, you can think of it as our pipeline, meaning our wins that will onboard later in the year, they have -- they are also well ahead of last year. And I do think that what's going on underneath that, actually, let me ask -- since we have Steve on the line, Steve, you're out there. I don't know if there are any employer prospects in your current undisclosed location, but maybe. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that activity at the employer level and with our partners?\nSteve Neeleman: Absolutely. And I would have been with you in New York, but I wasn't invited. But anyway, George, didn't hear your voice. Look, I just think that -- we talked about this in the past. I remember when we had -- we did have a nice large name brand employee that came on in the first quarter with an HRA, which has helped on the CDB stuff. And then more broadly, as we look at employers and what they're looking at towards the end of the year, I think most of the employers are thinking, you know what, costs are up, inflation is up. I think a lot of them are -- especially in the midsized are anxiously awaiting to see what's going to happen on the health care claims. Since most people on this call that know health care, they realize that hospitals are seeing higher labor costs. And at some point, you're going to have to translate this through to higher cost to payers, which ultimately ends up getting paid for by employers and things like that. And so -- and then if you just kind of wrap in the employer's own wage inflation issues and more broad inflation issues. I think most employers are saying, look, we know HAS. They read our case studies, and they see big brand name companies that are doing HSAs in kind of novel, interesting ways. We've got a case study out there where an employer figured out that you could fund lower income people's accounts more when you find higher income people's accounts, which drives higher adoption in lower areas where we used to see lower adoption on some people that are now starting to have accounts more. So that all combined with our kind of our Engage360 MAX enroll initiatives, where we're getting more and more employers signing up to allowing us to be able to reach out to their people in advance even of enrollment and take out these things, I think, are resulting in the fact that we're just executing better. And you never want a recession to be a factor of the drug of our business because we know it hurts all businesses, and we know it does offset with just as Jon pointed out, lower overall job growth. But we do think that HSA is because of the cost savings they can bring to employers because of the tax savings and tax savings revolves and employers that it is one of these things that tends to start to get more interest when you're in a tougher economic environment. So that's what we're seeing, George. And we're doing a better job, honestly, than we've ever done before, thanks to our marketing and our inside sales teams. And we look out and just getting the word out. I think it's a combination of things. But as far as the new logos are concerned, and Jon spoken to that, but we're kind of fingers crossed. We've had some really good sales here, and we're looking forward to bringing on some of these great new clients this year.\nGeorge Hill: That's super helpful. And if I could have what I hope is a very quick follow-up. Just a lot of us on the health care side are tracking the growth of the GLP-1 drugs that tend to come out of the gate pretty expensive and tend to blow through people's deductibles pretty quick. I was just wondering if you guys are seeing any impact at all on HSA balances or an increase in volatility, the balances through the GLP-1 drugs?\nJon Kessler: No, not yet.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. Easy answer. Thank you.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, George.\nJon Kessler: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Well, good afternoon, everyone.\nJon Kessler: Hey, Greg.\nGreg Peters: Steve, I'll invite you to New York if Jon won't just in case that matters.\nSteve Neeleman: Very kind of you. Thank you.\nGreg Peters: Yes. I guess can you comment on the seasonality in general administration and merger integration-related expenses? The reason why I'm asking is they came in a little bit below where I was certainly thinking, and I noticed you didn't change in merger integration guidance for the full-year. I would have thought that would have tapered off through the year, but it seems like you're sticking with that number. So just some detail on that would be helpful.\nTyson Murdock: Yes. I mean we're sticking with the number. We got to spend it, and I think if the timing of it is just it's getting so small now that the timing may add some volatility to it, Greg, is what I would say. So and then you mentioned G&A as well.\nGreg Peters: Yes.\nTyson Murdock: I want to make sure I understand that question a little bit more. Maybe just...\nGreg Peters: I'm just -- I'm sorry, just inside the P&L, there's a line item, general and administration expense. And I'm just -- it came in a little bit lighter than I was just wondering if there's anything going on inside there or if that's, sort of, the normalized expectation that was evident in the first quarter.\nTyson Murdock: Yes, I may go a little bit further just because you brought that line. I just -- last year, we had some stock comp forfeiture right in there. So if you look at last year versus this year, you'll see that it goes up actually. But from a trend line perspective over a long period of time, of course, we're trying to get some of the synergies running through there and things like that from that, so I think you see some of that as well. But it's a pretty small volatility in my mind if you just look at the longer-term quarters going back through time. So I hope that answered what you're trying to ask.\nGreg Peters: I think so. I can take the rest off-line. My other question was just on debt paydown that's running ahead. What's your expectation for the year on that?\nTyson Murdock: Just we'll take it as we go. I mean we'll look at what it is. What we did there is we paid off the principal payments for quite some time. So you won't see any short-term portion of that anymore. And so cash accumulation is going to help that. And I'm talking about the next couple of years, we won't have principal payments on it. We were able to elect it that way. So we thought that was a positive thing to do for the business and just make a bite at it.\nGreg Peters: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sandy Draper with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much and congrats on the strong quarter. This is one question about seasonality, but it applies to two lines. So first off, just trying to make sure, sort of, asked a little bit earlier, Tyson, when I'm thinking about either sequentially or year-over-year, the change in account or revenue per account, I'm trying to get the dynamics of the strong growth in HSAs lower price. You're starting to see some uptick in the CDBs, at least sequentially. But you're still down, by my math, about $0.07. So should we be thinking about sort of flattish? Or is it the season should be thinking about a year-over-year change? And how do we think about seasonality there? And then I wasn't quite clear what you referenced when you commented about normal seasonality on the interchange with how you're usually thinking about it. The first quarter is the highest drops down for the next two and then steps back up in the fourth quarter, but maybe not for the first quarter. Is that what you're applying? So I just want to make sure I've got the seasonality of those two target.\nTyson Murdock: Sure. Yes, I mean the second part, I think I'll take that, but you already kind of gave the answer. We just want to reiterate that that's how that seasonality works. And so you may see from a perspective of a little bit of better growth rate, maybe this quarter, okay, that's fine, but it's really just that same seasonality. And what we really are trying to make sure on that seasonality comment in the script is just that if you look back over time, we had pandemic, we had -- last year, we had an acquisition even a couple of years ago, right, that plays in that I just feel like people -- I want to make sure people understand that the quarters are a little bit more sequential and that we don't want people to get out of theirselves. The other thing to mention there, too, is just the impact from the variable rates that we're playing into the second half of last year as well. So that's kind of a longer answer to your question. And so again, just reiterating on top of that, the interchange portion of that is just normalized. And Jon, you're going to take the first part.\nJon Kessler: Yes. I mean, Sandy, the first part of your question was really about, I think, was about unit service fees and meaning service fees over total accounts. And I think you've kind of got all the right pieces. I mean the bulk of service fees, as you know, come from the CDB side of the business. And so as HSAs grow total accounts, there's a little bit of downward pressure there just from a mix shift perspective. But we seem to be holding our own there pretty good, and I think that's a fair way to look at the full-year. I'd probably just leave it there.\nSandy Draper: Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, Sandy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Larsen with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nDavid Larsen: Hi, congratulations on the good quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations for yield? I think you said it came in at 232 bps for the quarter. I think it was 211 bps last quarter. The guide, I think you said, is 235. Is that accurate? And then over what period of time will you expect to realize the benefit from the increase in the federal funds rate that has occurred over the past year? Will that take a couple of years? And I guess what I'm getting at is why only, I think, the 3 basis points of incremental yield between now and year-end. Thanks.\nJon Kessler: Yes. So during the year, during any particular fiscal year, the real variability that we see during the year is around the relatively small portion of our HSA cash that's in variable instruments. And last year, as you know, rates shot up throughout the year as that funds rate did. And that really explains most of the increase that you saw there, plus the fact that we had good growth in cash and so forth. And so this year, it's -- again, we'll see what really happens. But as you know, our guidance is based on forward curves now. And our guidance, if you kind of look at forward curves, you can see we sort of, in terms of variable rates, kind of peak up and then swing down. Our basic view is that the result of that is a much smoother situation over the course of the year relative to last year and similar to many prior years. And so our guidance is in that way. So what you said at the outset, yes, it is absolutely correct.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. Great. And then can you maybe just talk a little bit about the interchange revenue? I think it was short a very, very good pop sequentially. I mean, what are the key drivers there? I mean is it commuter revenue? Is it health care utilization and general utilization in the hospital and physician office environment? Just any additional color there would be very helpful.\nJon Kessler: Yes. I think the answer is the commuter does help a little bit because it is outgrowing. But really, a way to look at it is that the growth we saw in interchange, kind of, mirrors the growth in, for lack of a better term, accounts with cards and so on a year-over-year basis. So that's our new HSAs and some of our CUVs. So it's really -- that's pretty much what it is.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. Great. And if I could just squeeze one more in there. The HSA members, it was really flat sequentially. If we adjust for COBRA, what would that have been? And then when do you expect to fully comp the COBRA impact?\nJon Kessler: Could you ask that one more time? I'm sorry [Multiple Speakers]\nDavid Larsen: The number of HSA members relative to Jan '23, it was up a little bit sequentially, but looks kind of flat to me actually. Just is that because of the COBRA impact? And when would you expect to fully comp that?\nJon Kessler: Well, I think what you're referring to is total members. Let's just say HSA members are up 9%, total accounts on a year-over-year basis. You're talking sequentially.\nRichard Putnam: And to that point, David, our fourth quarter is when HSAs come in, there isn't a lot of HSAs.\nJon Kessler: Right. You have 1035 open and some closures. So your growth is going to be, what, $100 or 90 or something. And that's on the base of $8 million. So it's the first quarter is the answer to that in.\nDavid Larsen: Great. Thanks very much.\nJon Kessler: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Schoenhaus with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nScott Schoenhaus: Thanks. Congrats, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Apologies if I missed it, but state where you book the book of businesses in terms of enhanced rate? And did you reiterate your 30% target for the end of the year?\nJon Kessler: I didn't know that thing you risen to the level of something we reiterate. But yes, it's still our target.\nScott Schoenhaus: Okay. And where are you currently at, Jon?\nJon Kessler: We're a few hundred basis points shy of that. We're going to get there.\nScott Schoenhaus: Great. Great. And just a question on the M&A environment. I know that it has been kind of slower than you expected given that these banks want to hold on to the sticky HSA assets. Has anything changed from three months ago when you made those comments?\nJon Kessler: Fundamentally know, I do think that -- I think it's a point where because -- let me back up and say one thing, which is, as other analysts have noted, we have a ladder strategy. And some of our competitors have a more exposed strategy, either by virtue of the way they're structured or otherwise. And so if you're more exposed, and I'm not thinking about the small banks, but maybe some of the other competitors, if you're more exposed to lap to short rates, this might be a time where you're really looking at this because if you think that things are going to get wild and wooly with short rates. And so there's a little bit of that kind of chatter. But fundamentally, I mean, look, the fact that we did a pay down and so forth suggest that we feel like this is a period where we're more accumulating capital than spending it. And I think that's probably fair. And again, it also impacts our new HSA openings in the sense of just smaller HSA transfers that occur from smaller banks.\nScott Schoenhaus: Thanks for the color.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis with SVB Bank. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Davis: Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my question. So I hate to be the one to bring up bank turmoil. But last quarter, we did have a lot of discussions around enduring impact from some of the events in March and how it can maybe create greater demand for your sticky HSA deposits, and the bank turmoil has continued. So I was wondering if you've seen any greater interest in custodial partnerships, from folks like additional banks or if you're still mostly focused on second-story banks and avoiding the regional bank opportunity?\nJon Kessler: So I'm going to say yes to your first question. And on your second question, what we really concern ourselves with is from our perspective, and it's not -- we concern ourselves with the general quality of the institution. And it's not that we're, how do I say, it's not that we're -- at the end of the day, the FDIC is going to back our members. It's more that we want to have long-term relationships, and so we don't kind of want it to be a one and done situation like some SEC colleges and -- but not Florida. It's every graduated. And so…\nStephanie Davis: And my colleges in this question, like Florida.\nJon Kessler: I mean, Florida is awesome. Everyone knows it. Everyone knows it. They got this huge -- I could use those two letters that everyone's talking about these days. Florida is killing anyway. So we'll move on from there. But the answer to your first question is yes, and the answer to your second question is, we'll look at those things. We don't -- we're not -- this isn't a cash deployment season, but we want to build relationships that are going to last with different institutions on where we are.\nStephanie Davis: So let's do a follow-up on that then. Is there any other way to get more granularity on the yield on side? Just -- I mean you had the giant magnitude of the beat. So is it the contract renegotiations came in better than expected, maybe not from regional banks, something else? Was it floating rate mix? Was it enhanced rate mix? Like how enduring is this? And how much could it be an intra-quarter impact?\nJon Kessler: I don't think it's a huge inter-quarter impact because of most of the renegotiations and the like that we do are at the end of the year. So this -- the benefit we saw in the first quarter was principally a result of the movement to enhance rates and the -- and then the benefit on variable cash, so from a yield perspective. So I would think that this could be a benefit to us at year-end. But on the other hand, there's a lot of stuff floating around at year-end, and year-end a long time away. I will say one of the benefits of the enhanced rates program as it matures over the course of multiple years is that we're going to have less of this year-end thing. And so you won't -- we won't all be holding our breath for December and January every year, and that will be good.\nStephanie Davis: I’ll keep quite. All busy. Alright, thanks. I’ll hope back in the queue.\nJon Kessler: That's not a name we mentioned, because recruiters listen to these things. Say it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good afternoon and congratulations. And Steve, we would be thrilled if you were here in New York with us. So we’re super glad here.\nJon Kessler: I didn't even know I had any authority over where Steve went. That's a new thing. And I'm sorry, Mark, go ahead.\nMark Marcon: And we're looking forward to seeing you guys tomorrow. But just a very short question and then a little bit of a longer one. But the super short question is on the enhanced yield product, is the duration structure the same as what you've had on your traditional bank partnership agreements?\nJon Kessler: So our cash commitment under enhanced rates is a little bit different. It's typically a 5-year cash commitment. However, the reason we can do that is that we are -- that whereas in the bank products, we have to have separate products to provide for the liquidity. Here, the liquidity is built in. So the actual average duration, if you want to think about it that way, when you account for the fact that there's a portion that we have, we can pull in and out whenever we want is much closer to our three-year inside track.\nMark Marcon: How sensitive is that portion of the enhanced deal product to changes in yields in the overall market? Is it a...\nJon Kessler: It's built in -- the liquidity component is built into the underlying rate we receive. So again, all of this is designed to produce. In addition to a higher yield overall, it's designed to produce smoothness over time. We want to get you all as best as we can out of the business, at least for the short and medium term of being fixed income analysis.\nMark Marcon: Okay. Great. And then what -- just wanted some general comments with regards to the competitive environment. I mean you're clearly -- you continue to gain the most share and continue to grow rapidly. But just wondering, how has that evolved, say, over the last 2 years? What's your perspective, Jon?\nJon Kessler: I guess I would generally say that what we're seeing over this period of time is a continuation of trends that we've seen for a long time. If you look at the seven-year information that came out, I think it came out since we last announced. In addition to showing -- and maybe it was just before, I can't remember. But in addition to showing that we had maintained our number one position in terms of both assets and accounts, it does show a consolidation. And that really, if you look at it among the five or five largest players, the growth has principally come from, in market share terms has principally come from HealthEquity and Fidelity. And we do compete with each other, obviously. But we also -- and you can see this in the average balances, we also fish in somewhat different ponds in terms of Fidelity, also doing a lot of rollover business and the like as people retire. And so I think that's the main -- what I've seen is that we're really benefiting at the expense of some other players. I guess I would say one other thing, Mark, that isn't -- it's not something that's always very exciting to talk about on these calls. But as we discussed back in March, the team had a very, very good year from the perspective of execution on service to our clients and to their broker partners and our retirement partners and our health partners at the end of the year. And I think that's helping in terms of new logo wins. I really did. When people have a good experience at the end of the year, like the brokers, they're more likely to send business your way in the next year. And that's very much to the credit of Angelique Hill and the service team and our technology team led by Eli Rosner on the tech side and Merv and Larry on the security and IT side. So I just think that plays a role as well.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, Mark.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. Thank you. Look forward seeing you tomorrow.\nJon Kessler: Yes, sir.\nRichard Putnam: Hey, Mark. [Indiscernible]\nMark Marcon: But next time.\nJon Kessler: There’s still red eye, don't say it. I would call your bluff.\nSteve Neeleman: I like you, Mark, when there's snow on the ground and there's no snow back there. So…\nJon Kessler: He’s a skier. Who’s next?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAllen Lutz: Thanks for taking the questions. I guess one for Tyson. You talked about the enhanced rate product kind of going from 0 to a goal of 30% this year. So over three years from nothing to 30% of the book. But I'm looking at the custodial cost of goods sold line, and that really hasn't moved as a percent of custodial cash over that time period. And I'm looking at the enhanced rates here, and they're obviously higher than the core rate that you're paying out to the consumer? So I'm just curious, is there something going on with the type of consumer that's electing for the enhanced rates? Do they have a much smaller cash portfolio than the average, just normal customer? I'm curious what the disconnect is there. Thanks.\nJon Kessler: Yes, I'm going to take this 1 because it's really -- the answer has much more to do with the marketing and so forth. So there are two things going on there. First, keep in mind that the uptake rate among new account holders is very high. And by definition, new account holders have smaller balances. And so we have not -- so the impact has been pretty modest in terms of if you sort of fold the whole thing into our custodial expense. Now that will change over time in relative terms relative to what would have occurred with cash. But that's really the big answer to your question. So -- it's not a function perhaps of like Fed election one way or the other. It is a function of the fact that you are that the product is the people who are most likely to see it are you're brand new to us, and you're making a decision upfront about where you're going to go. And something like, I want to say, 85% to 90% of our new enrollees are choosing enhanced rates. The second point I would make is that people who keep very large cash balances, the kind that earn relatively high rates, they're typically doing that precisely, because they place very high value on the FDIC component of it, right? Otherwise, they would be investing those dollars or putting them in a short-term bond fund or what have you. And so in a funny way, it's not entirely unreasonable to expect that those folks would stay in FDIC cash.\nAllen Lutz: Got it. Thank you very much.\nJon Kessler: I thought about this question, too. We were curious about it over the last few quarters. And this is the first time in this form anyone's asked about it, but that's the answer.\nRichard Putnam: Thanks, Allen.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jon Kessler for any closing remarks.\nJon Kessler: So first of all, thanks, everyone. I'm sorry if you've already pre-purchased Cabana ware, we'll do our best, like Richard. We did get this thing done in under an hour, which is something to celebrate for you as well as for us, and particularly for Richard. And I think there's a double standard on the length of answers, mine, where I think, on average, the shortest. But nonetheless thank you all, and I appreciate the team's work on a great quarter. And we will, if not earlier, see everyone back in September. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
