        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Rob and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Motorcar Parts of America Third Quarter 2024 webcast and Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Gary Maier, vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nGary Maier: Thanks. Thanks, Rob. Thanks, everyone for joining us for our call. Before we begin and I turn the call over to Selwyn Joffe, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and David Lee, the company's Chief Financial Officer, I'd like to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statement included in today's press release. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor for certain forward-looking statements, including statements made during today's conference call. Such forward-looking statements are based on the company's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the company. There can be no assurance of future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by Motorcar Parts of America. Actual results may differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainty, some of which are beyond the control of the company and are subject to change based upon various factors. In particular, expectations that anticipated future growth and opportunities with customers may not be achieved. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a more detailed discussion of some of the ongoing risks and uncertainties of the company's business, I refer you to the various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'd like to begin the call and turn it over to Selwyn.\nSelwyn Joffe: Thank you, Gary. I appreciate everyone joining us today. We are encouraged by our operating results for the quarter, including strong sales performance, increased gross margins, increased EBITDA and significant positive cash flow and a revolver pay down of $50 million to $102.8 million of net debt. While some of this cash flow resulted from deferred collection catch up in the quarter; for the nine months, we generated $48.4 million in positive cash. I might add that these results were particularly impressive considering the industry's softness in November and December. Recent extreme weather conditions throughout the country should help bolster this industry's sales softness in future quarters. We were also pleased that gross profit for the quarter and nine months increased substantially. gross margins continued to improve and benefit from better operating efficiencies as anticipated, particularly from increased overhead absorption with higher sales and production in newer product categories. I should also add that price increases in effect, but not yet realized, will contribute an additional $10 million in annualized sales, and gross profit and EBITDA. We remain focused on three key initiatives: sales, profitability and neutralizing working capital. We are confident that our sales and profitability will grow organically and through market share gains in all of our product lines. Increased profitability along with our working capital initiatives will further enhance cash flow generation. With regard to working capital, we continue to focus on the balance sheet including extending vendor payment terms. This initiative is being supported by the launch of our vendor finance program offered to our suppliers. This enables us to extend our payment terms while facilitating a program for our suppliers to have early access to capital. We expect to increase the number of days outstanding for accounts payable, which will result in additional cash generation. While in its early stages, this program is progressing nicely and will gain increased traction in the months ahead. I should note that the effects of this program are not yet reflected in our results and will provide additional upside to cash flow generation. From a strategic standpoint, we are continuing to leverage our strengths, including great products manufactured at state-of-the-art facilities, solid customer relationships, industry leading skew coverage, not to mention our value-added merchandising and marketing support. We are continuing to expand hard part sales in Mexico with opportunities to further expand in other Latin American countries with multiple product lines as our customers experienced increased demand for aftermarket parts. The rate of growth is exciting and we are well positioned to utilize our footprint to meet the growing demand for our non-discretionary aftermarket parts. Our test solutions and diagnostic equipment in particular are industry leading JBT-1 benchtop testers for alternative starters used by major automotive retailers and professional installers continues to grow significantly. We believe the market opportunity for additional growth in the U.S. is approximately $110 million and we are well on our way. favorable industry dynamics continue to bode well for the company and we are extremely well positioned for sustainable top and bottom-line growth in our hard parts business, as well as the testing solutions. Let me take a moment to further discuss our near-term initiatives to support our long-term growth and profitability plan. Our near-term plan is in motion as we expect to achieve significant growth in all of our product lines, including our quality-built brand that continues to gain significant market share within the professional market. This includes our most recent additions to our portfolio of brake calipers, pads and rotors. Operating efficiency improvements are continuing as volume increases. Overall, this growth is supported by investments, especially the company's global footprint expansion in Mexico, backed by a well-trained and a seasoned team of professional employees. Also, we have expanded our Malaysian operation to add capacity and additional capabilities to support customers. We recently opened a new state-of-the-art wheel hub manufacturing facility in Malaysia, enabling us to ship product directly to our customer. Congratulations to our spectacular operating team, especially to those in Singapore and Malaysia. Our business growth is strategic and we are focused on generating solid cash flow and profitability. The strong cash generation will enable us the flexibility to further pay down debt and pursue other related opportunities to enhance shareholder value. In conclusion, non-discretionary aftermarket parts for the internal combustion engine market will be here for decades and outlook supported by recently updated industry data showing that the average age of vehicle is twelve and a half years. It is worth highlighting that the population of vehicles operating with internal combustion engines versus EVs represents 98 point -- approximately 98.3% of all vehicles on the road. One of our key competitive advantages is our ability to offer a broad range of applications for all makes and models. We remain focused on newer model applications and our ability to meet expected demand as these vehicles enter the replacement part [ph]. As you probably know, the emerging electric vehicle market is still quite small relative to the overall car park population. Recent news articles regarding EV range, particularly in cold regions in the country contribute to consumer hesitancy to plug in. but as technology improves and these types of issues are addressed, we expect to continue to benefit in both markets with product functionality and applications across both EV and ICE applications. While I am disappointed in the tax valuation allowance, I want to emphasize that it has no bearing on any operating metrics, cash flow, tax liability, or any economics of the company. It is simply required by GAAP. Finally, we have recently announced change to our sales team. Jamie Cook has been promoted to Senior Vice President of sales and marketing. She's succeeding Rick Mochulsky, who will transition to a new role as Senior Vice President of Business Development. Jamie and Rick have worked closely together at MPA for many years. Jamie is recognized throughout the automotive aftermarket. She is an exceptional leader with the added benefit of being a role model for women seeking to advance in the industry. Rick will remain an important member of our team in his new role, helping to drive demand for all of our products, both from existing and new retail and professional customers. I'll now turn the call over to David to review our results in greater detail.\nDavid Lee: Thank you, Selwyn and good morning, everyone. I encourage everyone to read the earnings press release issued this morning, as well as the 10-Q that will be filed later today. Let me first provide key highlights for the fiscal third quarter. net sales increased 13.2% to $171.9 million. gross margin improved by 3.7 percentage points. Gross profit increased 43.1% to $30 million. Operating income increased 170.1% to $9.5 million, and the company generated cash of approximately $53.6 million. I should mention that gross profit for the quarter was impacted by non-cash items, as well as cash items. The non-cash items reflect core and finished good premium amortization, and revaluation of cores on customers' shelves, which are unique to certain of our products and required by GAAP. The total for these non-cash items in the quarter was approximately $4.4 million. A more detailed explanation of core accounting is available on our website and I would encourage anyone with questions about this topic to review the video. Third quarter gross margin was 17.5%, compared with 13.8% a year earlier. Gross margin was impacted by 2.6% from the previously-mentioned non-cash items, as well as 0.9% from cash items as detailed in Exhibit 3 of this morning's earnings press release. in summary, in addition to the non-cash and cash items explained previously, gross margin for the fiscal '24 third quarter reflects the partial benefit of pricing increases that went into effect during the current quarter and operating efficiencies. Additionally, we have meaningful annualized pricing increases that started in the current fourth quarter, which will further contribute to gross margin enhancements. Operating expenses were $20.5 million, compared with $17.5 million in the prior-year period. This included a non-cash gain of $3.1 million for the foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities in Florida contracts, compared with a prior-year non-cash gain of $4.3 million. The remaining $1.9 million of operating expense increases included employee-related expenses. Operating income for the third quarter increased 170.1% to $9.5 million from $3.5 million in the prior year. Results for the fiscal third quarter were impacted by $6.8 million or $0.26 per share of higher interest expenses, primarily due to higher market interest rates and higher utilization of the accounts receivable discount programs due to higher sales. interest expense was $18.3 million, compared with $11.5 million for last year, which is primarily related to our customers' accounts receivable discount programs. We are working diligently to address the higher interest environment, particularly areas that we can control. For example, among other initiatives, we are focused on neutralizing working capital to generate positive cash flow to pay down debt as evidenced by our year-to-date results. In addition, we continue to work with our customers to mitigate higher interest rates. due primarily to a $37.5 million U.S. federal and state deferred tax asset valuation allowance under U.S. GAAP recorded during the fiscal '24 third quarter, income tax expense was $37.3 million, compared with an income tax benefit of $9 million for the same period a year ago. Let me emphasize that this tax valuation allowance is required by GAAP and is non-cash and does not impact any operating metrics. due primarily to $40.4 million of non-cash items including a $37.5 million U.S. federal and state deferred tax asset valuation allowance under U.S. GAAP noted previously, we reported a net loss for the fiscal '24 third quarter of $47.2 million or $2.40 per share compared with net income of $1 million or $0.05 per diluted share a year ago. To reemphasize, this accounting item is non-cash and does not impact any operating metrics. The details of the non-cash and cash items impacting results are in exhibit 1 of this morning's earnings press release. As I mentioned previously, we experienced a 13.2% sales increase despite industry's softness in November and December with this higher expected sales volume moving forward and the full impact of certain price increases already in effect, results are expected to further improve. As someone mentioned, I should also add that price increases in effect will contribute an additional $10 million in annualized sales, gross profit and EBITDA. EBITDA for the fiscal third quarter was $11.2 million. EBITDA was impacted by $3.9 million of non-cash items and impacted by $1.9 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items mentioned above was $17 million for the third quarter. EBITDA for the prior year's fiscal third quarter was $6.6 million. EBITDA was impacted by $646,000 of non-cash items as was $3.8 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items mentioned above was $11 million for the prior-year third quarter. Now, let me discuss the nine-month results. Net sales for the fiscal '24 nine-month period increased 8.2% to a record $528.2 million from $488.3 million. gross profit for the fiscal '24 nine-month period increased 25.6% to $97.8 million from $77.8 million a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal '24 nine-month period was 18.5%, compared with 15.9% a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal '24 nine-month period was impacted by $12.6 million or a 2.4% of non-cash items and $6.7 million or 1.3% of cash items. operating income for the nine-month period increased 166.7% to $33.9 million from $12.7 million in the prior year. Results for the nine months were impacted by $17.7 million or $0.68 per share of higher interest expenses, primarily due to higher market interest rates and higher utilization for our customers' accounts receivable discount programs due to higher sales. interest expense was $45.4 million, compared with $27.7 million for last year. As I previously noted, we are working diligently to address the higher interest environment, particularly areas that we can control. due primarily to $49.5 million of non-cash items including a $37.5 million U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets valuation allowance under U.S. GAAP, we reported a net loss for the fiscal '24 nine-month period of $50.6 million or $2.58 per share, compared with a net loss of $5.7 million or $0.29 per share a year ago. Once again, this accounting item is non-cash and does not impact any operating metrics. The details of the non-cash and cash items impacting results on exhibit 2 of this morning's earnings press release, results are expected to improve from various initiatives that will be realized as I discussed earlier, concerning pricing increases in effect and higher sales volume. EBITDA for the fiscal '24 nine-month period was $40.9 million. EBITDA was impacted by $16 million of non-cash items, as well as $7.7 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items mentioned above was $64.7 million for the current period. EBITDA for the prior-year fiscal '23 nine-month period was $22 million. EBITDA was impacted by $12.9 million of non-cash items, as well as $12.6 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items mentioned above was $47.5 million for the prior-year nine-month period. Now, we will move on to cash flow and key corporate items. The company generated approximately $53.6 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter, including accounts receivable catch up from the prior quarter and approximately $48.4 million of cash from operating activities for the nine-month period, which is not impacted by any accounts receivable deferral. During the nine-month period, the company reduced net bank debt by $43.7 million to $102.8 million from $146.5 million. We expect to generate an increase in operating profit on a year-over-year basis for fiscal '24, supported by organic growth from customer demand and operating efficiencies from a now-completed footprint expansion and generate positive cash flow for fiscal '24. In addition to our goal of generating increased operating profits, we are diligently focused on opportunities to neutralize working capital growth, including customer product demand planning, enhanced inventory management and improving vendor payment terms. Our investments are bearing fruit. We are gratified by the ongoing success of our expanded operations in Mexico, and the growth and momentum of our emerging brake categories along with expectations of increasing financial performance from both new and existing product lines. Our net debt at the end of the quarter, excluding our convertible note, was approximately $102.8 million while total cash and availability was approximately $126.3 million. For further explanation, on the reconciliation of items that impact the results and non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to exhibits 1 through 5 in this morning's earnings press release. I would now like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Koranda from Roth MKM. Your line is open.\nMike Zabran: Hey guys, it's Mike Zabran on for Matt. Can we just start like usual with the breakdown of product revenue by mix?\nDavid Lee: Yes. So, for the third quarter, rotating electrical was 65%, brake-related products was 21%, wheel hubs was 11% and others was 3%.\nMike Zabran: Got it. Helpful. So, the release in the -- on the call, you talked about a slowdown in November, in December. Maybe, just elaborate a little bit further on what exactly happened and what's our sense for why demand was weak in those months?\nSelwyn Joffe: Well, we started off the quarter with a great October and I think a lot of the professional installer base got soft. I think that we had some pretty mild weather. I mean, again, it's very hard for me to really put an accurate finger on the pulse as to why things softened up. The fundamental metrics remain good, but we've seen that now that there was some extreme weather mostly in the west and east part of the country. We've seen a pickup, so while it's hard to predict. I mean, we are maintaining our guidance for the year and we are optimistic, should come back. I mean, I just don't know, I wish I could give you an exact, x, y, z explanation as to why this happens. The other issue that we have is that and I don't know if this is a fact or not, but sometimes it's our customers' fiscal calendar year ends and maybe, they're managing their working capital level, so that could have an effect as well. But really, I think that the fundamentals for November, December on a macro level across the industry, across the base, it definitely was a little softer out there in particular. I mean, I can only refer to our products, but we think that just number of vehicles and footprint research that we've shown showed it a little bit softer.\nMike Zabran: Got it. Okay. And Selwyn, you said we are sticking with the guidance through the end of the year.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. So, we've had a strong start to this quarter. And we'll see, as we come towards spring, we're optimistic still about demand. We're busy and yes, we're sticking to our guidance.\nMike Zabran: Got it. Okay. okay, maybe, just help level set us on how much pricing has been put through as of today. And we talked about it a little bit on the call, but just further elaborate on how much pricing has been put through today. Should we expect to keep continuing to take price and then I have a follow-up as well. but maybe, let's just start there.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. So, it's becoming harder and harder to quantify on how much is put through and how much isn't put through. I mean, we put a significant amount through, there's $10 million of annualized pricing that's already in the existing price increases that hasn't been reflected in the numbers that'll start in this quarter. And we expect to mitigate inflationary costs and hopefully including interest in pricing strategies. We also, as we pick up volume, we become more operationally efficient and we've got a lot of initiatives on continuous improvement that continue to drive profitability. So, across the board, I mean, our biggest challenge today is mitigating the interest expense. I mean the interest expenses is due -- the vast majority is due to more success with sales. And with the new loan agreement that we have, we're able to collect that cash and you can see our operating metrics, we've paid down over $40 million in debt for the nine months. I think the quarter is a little disproportionate, because of some of the deferrals, but the nine months is not. And so we -- I think, everyone is aware of the interest rates and we expect to continue to mitigate it.\nMike Zabran: Got it. Makes sense. And so then the price increases that we started in the fourth quarter, I guess, when do those fully filter through? Do we have a sense for that?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. So they start in the fourth quarter, just assume in middle, middle to late fourth quarter, but they filter through going forward on an annualized basis, all those, there's another $10 million that'll be over and above what we've already got in the numbers for the next 12 months.\nMike Zabran: Got it. Okay. So, those start filtering through as soon as --\nSelwyn Joffe: That's right.\nMike Zabran: Okay. Okay, got it. Okay. that makes sense. Last one from me, the tax valuation allowance. So, I understand, it was required by GAAP and it's a non-cash expense. We made that very clear, but maybe just why exactly did we have to recognize that allowance? Just help us get a better sense for that.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. So, the first thing, let me just sort of back up and say it's -- those assets remain on our balance sheet and we are optimistic that we're going to be able to use those assets and as we get more GAAP income, we'll be able to reverse it and it'll take some time. but assuming the company performs, which we expect it to, and we'll reverse them, it doesn't affect our tax liability, it doesn't affect cash, it doesn't affect anything. And the real, the trigger is that we had a higher expectation for results in the third quarter in this past quarter that we're reporting on. And we had a soft two months out of the three months and we had to revise our -- we had to -- we did revise our forecast, internal forecast down and that results in a taxable loss in the U.S. entities. And so we had to put a reserve on the tax asset. It's unfortunate, I hate it. but it's the rules and that's what's happened. And again, while the optics of it and the rules of the rules, in no way affects us other than what the perception is out, it no way affects us in terms of anything that we're doing right now. And our focus continues to drive to drive GAAP income and all income. And so as that reverses those assets, that valuation will come off the assets.\nMike Zabran: Got it. Thanks, Selwyn. That's all from me guys.\nSelwyn Joffe: Thank you very much.\nDavid Lee: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt Dane from Titan Capital Management. Your line is open.\nMatt Dane: Great. thank you. I wanted to ask about the new Malaysian facility that you referenced in the call. I was hoping you could walk through some of the benefits that you expect from that. I just wasn't certain if you were just expanding capacity or if there's other benefits or just help me understand that if you could.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. So, that's a great question, Matt. That's -- it's very exciting for us. What we did there is we opened -- we've been in Malaysia, I wish I knew the exact number of years, I mean probably over three decades. And we've been able to continue to grow the old facility. What we've done is we've created a brand-new state-of-the-art facility, which allows us now to meet all the tests to ship our customers direct from Malaysia to our customers. So, it'll never be touched here. So, wheel hubs, the new wheel hub program, which we -- which is in line with what we've been doing, same thing now, has more capacity to go direct with storage for that inventory staging areas for that inventory to be shipped directly to our customers around the world, but in particular, in the United States. And that's a big deal, because our competitors are Chinese based and they have subject to tariffs, and our customers buy large orders of this and so want to take ship direct programs and we think that's going to open up some big opportunities going forward. I think short term you'll see a little bit of a dip in that product line and then in the next six months we should see some extreme -- I think we'll see some extreme gains in that product line. So, very exciting and it's a fabulous plant already had a major customer visit and he was extremely impressed with it. I mean and that's all in the CapEx. It's all paid for and done.\nMatt Dane: Okay. So, you expect this plant and the cost efficiency of shipping directly to the customer, it's basically to lead to some substantial revenue gains as you gained share from your Chinese competitors. Is that what I heard you say more or less?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. Yes, I think we'll see margin gain and share gain in time.\nMatt Dane: Great, great. Glad to hear. I also did want to ask about the quality bill product line and reference that very briefly in the call as well. Just was curious, the traction that you are seeing with that product line, how is that relative to your expectations?\nSelwyn Joffe: It's -- well, we have high expectations, I'll start there. So, although answering relative, every time I get results of how we're doing, my expectations grow. but I mean, we've growing that, we've had over 40% growth rates in that product line and that product branding name, and it's becoming a nationally recognized brand. and I'm extremely excited about how that's unfolding. We're adding many new customers to the brake line under our quality-built name, and we are just getting more and more demand for quality-built. And so that brand value and that brand equity, we are excited about that. The other side of that is there's no factoring cost, there's no supply chain cost on launching and growing that business. So that's also encouraging to us.\nMatt Dane: Okay, good to know. I appreciate it.\nSelwyn Joffe: Thank you.\nDavid Lee: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Selwyn Joffe for some final closing remarks.\nSelwyn Joffe: Okay, thank you. So, just in summary, we're excited about year-to-date accomplishments and our outlook; in particular, our strong cash flow, our pay down of debt. We expect the further benefit of additional price increases and the opportunities to further enhance shareholder value. We are encouraged by our leadership position in the industry and our solid customer partnerships. We built the platform for growth that is not easily duplicated and we expect this growth to continue on in the future, especially as the demand for our non-discretionary aftermarket products. So, the critical need for our consumers, the cars are on the road that the car population continues to grow and non-discussion parts will be there. There may be temporary ups and downs, but long-term, there's a medium-term and near-term, the demand will be there. In closing, I must recognize the contributions of all of our team members, who are continuously focused on providing the highest level of service. We are all committed to being the industry leader for parts and solutions that move our world today and in the future. We appreciate your continued support and we thank you again, for joining us the call -- on the call and we look forward to speaking with you when we host our fiscal 2024 year-end conference call in June and at the various investor conferences in the interim. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Motorcar Parts of America Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Gary Maier, VP of Communications and Investor Relations with Motorcar Parts of America. You may begin your conference.\nGary Maier: Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Before I turn the call over to Selwyn Joffe, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Lee, the company's Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statement included in today's press release. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor for certain forward-looking statements including statements made during today's conference call. Such forward-looking statements are based on the company's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the company. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by Motorcar Parts of America. Actual results may differ from those projected in these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond the control of the company and are subject to change based upon various factors. In particular, expectations about anticipated future growth and opportunities with customers may not be achieved. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a more detailed discussion of some of the ongoing risks and uncertainties of the company's business I refer you to the company's various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I would now like to begin the call and turn it over to Selwyn.\nSelwyn Joffe: Thank you, Gary. I appreciate everyone joining us today. We were encouraged by record sales and record gross profit for the quarter and six months and solid cash flow from operating activities. The company generated approximately $15 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter. For the six-month period the company used approximately $5 million in operating activities. However, I should mention had we not intentionally decided to lower collection of receivables by $35 million as of September 30 we would have generated approximately $30 million of positive cash from operating activities for the six month period, predominantly coming in the second quarter. Using the customer supply chain vendor finance programs, we have the option to draw down on customer payments at any time which David will explain in more detail. Industry trends remain favorable and we're seeing improving operational efficiencies with increasing sales volume. We're continuing our focus on leveraging our strengths including our solid customer relationships, highly regarded product quality industry-leading steel coverage and quality not to mention our value added merchandising and marketing support. In summary, our operating efficiency improvements along with increased overhead absorption from higher sales and production and price increases all bode well for margin expansion. Our quarterly results reflect the benefit of some price increases and we anticipate additional benefits from further price increases for the balance of the year. We're excited with our positive cash flow generation for the quarter and remain focused on neutralizing working capital as much as possible for the balance of the year. Our initiatives; include increasing gross profit and operating income, managing our inventory as a percentage of sales and implementing programs to extend days outstanding on accounts payable. As a reminder, we expect sales for fiscal 2024 to be between $720 million and $740 million, representing between 5.4% and 8.3% year-over-year growth, respectively. With respect to cash flow, our expectation is to continue to generate cash. David will expand upon this in a few moments. Regarding year end guidance, we expect operating income before the impact of the non-cash and cash items and before depreciation and amortization to be between $90 million and $95 million. To provide more details before the non-cash foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts, the non-cash impact of revaluation of cores on customer shelves and supply chain disruptions, operating income of income for fiscal 2024 is expected to be between $60 million and $65 million. We estimate other non-cash items will be approximately $16 million including core and finished goods premium amortization and share-based compensation and cash expenses to be approximately $2 million for special EV related R&D expenses that impact operating income. Depreciation and amortization are estimated to be approximately $12 million. In short for the fiscal 2024 second half, we expect to continue to enhance our gross margins across the board and enhance our cash flow. Our multi-year strategic initiatives and favorable industry dynamics bode well for the company and we are extremely well-positioned for sustainable top and bottom-line growth in our hard parts business as well as testing solutions. Now let me expand a bit further, and provide some updates to other drivers of our business to support our ability to achieve our longer-term financial targets. We continue to experience meaningful traction, with customers and consumers with the launch of outbreak related product lines with operating efficiency improvements continuing, as volume increases and with fixed cost absorption. We've continued to expand HubSpot Sales in Mexico, with multiple product lines as our customers experienced increased demand for aftermarket products. We're receiving increasing orders and new customer interest for our test solutions and diagnostic equipment. In particular, our benchtop testers for alternators and starters from major automotive retailers and distributors to the professional installer. Major global automotive aerospace and research institutions for electric vehicle mobility, product development and design, continue to purchase our equipment and utilize, our Detroit tech center testing services. Lastly, the AAPEX show last week was very positive and the outlook for new business remains very strong. We continue to be well-positioned to address both the internal combustion engine market, and the emerging electric vehicle market, with product functionality and applications across both markets. Industry data continues to support our view that strong demand for our internal combustion engine applications, and our broad line of non-discretionary aftermarket parts will be here for decades, notwithstanding electric vehicle growth, which still represents a small percentage of the overall copper. I'll now turn the call over to David, to review our results in greater detail.\nDavid Lee: Thank you, Selwyn and good morning, everyone. I encourage everyone to read the earnings press release issued this morning, as well as the 10-Q that will be filed later today. Let me first, provide key highlights for the fiscal second quarter. Net sales for the three months increased 14% to a record $196.6 million. Gross margin increased by 5.5 percentage points. Gross profit increased 35.2% to a record $41.1 million, and the company generated approximately $15 million cash from operating activities. I should mention that gross profit for the quarter was impacted by non-cash items, as well as cash items. The non-cash items reflect core and finished good premium amortization and revaluation of cores on customer shelves, which are unique to certain of our products and required by GAAP. The total for these non-cash items in the quarter was approximately $4.7 million. A more detailed explanation of core accounting is available on our website and I would encourage anyone with questions about this topic, to review the video. Second quarter gross margin was 20.9% compared with 15.4% a year earlier. Gross margin was impacted by 2.4% from the previously mentioned non-cash items, as well as 1.6% from cash items as detailed in exhibit three of this morning's earnings press release. In summary, in addition to the non-cash and cash items explained previously, gross margin for the fiscal 2024 second quarter reflects the partial benefit of price increases, that went into effect during the current quarter and operating efficiencies as well as changes in product mix. Operating expenses were $27.2 million compared with $24.7 million in the prior year period. This included a non-cash expense of $4.8 million, for the foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts, compared with a prior year non-cash expense of $1.1 million. The remaining $1.1 million of operating expense decreases, included cost reduction initiatives.  Net loss for the fiscal 2024 second quarter improved to $2 million or $0.10 per share from a net loss of $6.5 million or $0.34 per share, a year ago. As detailed in exhibit one of this morning's earnings press release, non-cash items impacted results for the quarter by $8.7 million or $0.44 per share and cash items by a $2.7 million impact or $0.14 per share. In addition to the above non-cash and cash items, results for the quarter were impacted by the previously mentioned items that impacted gross margins. As Selwyn mentioned, results are expected to benefit moving forward as the full impact of certain price increases realized combined with higher sales volumes. Results for the fiscal second quarter were impacted by $6.1 million or $0.23 per share of higher interest expenses, primarily due to higher market interest rates related to the supply chain vendor finance programs. Interest expense was $15.4 million, compared with $9.3 million for last year. We've received meaningful annualized price increases, which will contribute to a net income enhancement. Income tax benefit was $46,000 compared with an income tax benefit of $914,000 the same period a year ago. I should mention that the effective tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was affected in part, due to the inability to recognize the benefit of losses by specific foreign jurisdictions. However, we expect that these losses will be utilized against future profits which will benefit future tax rate. In short, there are various factors impacting the tax effect. EBITDA for the second quarter was $16.3 million. EBITDA was impacted by $11.6 million of non-cash item and impacted by $3.5 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items, mentioned above, was $31.4 million for the second quarter. EBITDA for the prior year second quarter was $4.9 million. EBITDA was impacted by $6.7 million of non-cash items as well as $5.1 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items, mentioned above, was $16.7 million for the prior year second quarter. Now let me discuss the six months results. Net sales for the fiscal 2024 six month period increased 5.9% to a record $356.3 million from $336.5 million. Gross profit for the fiscal 2024 six month period increased to a record $67.7 million from $56.8 million a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2024 six month period was 19% compared with 16.9% a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2024 six month period was impacted by $8.1 million or 2.3% of non-cash items and $5.2 million or 1.5% of cash items. Net loss for the fiscal 2024 six month period improved to $3.4 million or $0.17 per share from a net loss of $6.7 million or $0.35 per share a year ago. Results were impacted by non-cash items totaling $9.1 million or $0.47 per share and cash items totaling $4.4 million or $0.23 per share as detailed in Exhibit 2. Results expected to benefit from various initiatives that will be realized that I discussed earlier, concerning price increases and higher sales volume. EBITDA for the fiscal 2024 six month period was $29.6 million. EBITDA was impacted by $12.2 million of non-cash items as well as $5.9 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items mentioned above was $47.7 million for the current period. EBITDA for the prior year fiscal 2023 six month period was $15.4 million. EBITDA was impacted by $12.2 million of non-cash items as well as $8.9 million cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items, mentioned above, was $36.5 million for the prior year six month period. Now we will move on to cash flow and key corporate items. The company generated approximately $15 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter with expectations as strong operating cash flow will continue for the balance of the fiscal year. During this period, the company intentionally deferred collecting approximately $15 million of receivables offered through its customer supply chain vendor finance programs, which resulted in lowering cash flow by that amount and interest expense savings of approximately $1 million. This enabled the company to defer interest expenses until price increases for interest rates are fully recognized. Additionally, the company used this liquidity to pay down the $11.25 million balance of its term loan. Interest rates on the term loan were approximately 2-percentage points higher than rates offered by the company's customer supply chain vendor finance program. In short, we will continue throughout the year to monitor interest expense levels and opportunities to reduce interest based on the timing of monetizing customer payments, we can elect when to be paid through the customer's supply chain vendor finance programs offered and we paid a proportional discount rate. We expect to generate an increase in operating profit on a year-over-year basis for fiscal 2024 supported by organic growth from customer demand and operating efficiencies from our now completed footprint expansion and generate positive cash flow for fiscal 2024. In addition to our goal of generating increased operating profits, we're diligently focused on opportunities to neutralize working capital growth, including customer product demand planning, enhanced inventory management and improving vendor payment terms. Our investments are and will further bear fruit. We're gratified by the ongoing success of our expanded operations in Mexico and the growth momentum of our emerging brake categories, along with expectations of increasing financial performance from both new and existing product lines. Our net debt at the end of the quarter, excluding our convertible note, was approximately $155 million while total cash and availability was approximately $112 million. For further explanation on the reconciliation of items that impacted results and non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Exhibits 1 through 5 in this morning's earnings press release. I would now like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Matt Koranda from ROTH MKM. Please go ahead with your question.\nMatt Koranda: Hey guys, good morning. Just wanted to start off with the traditional question around the breakdown in revenue between rotating electrical wheel hub, the brake products and other?\nDavid Lee: Hi Matt, so for the second quarter, rotating electrical was 67%; wheel hubs 9%; brake-related products was 20%; and others was 4%.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the growth that you're getting out of brake, can you maybe just talk about how we should think about the new business that's rolling on there? I know you're expecting a bit of a ramp up. There's growth in the quarter obviously. There was last quarter, but it feels like still there's a bit more on the come for the back half. Maybe just talk about, how we should think about growth expectations in the brake products side of the business.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yeah, I think things are going well in general across the board for our product lines. The brake business is continuing to grow lots of opportunities many significant opportunities that we're preparing for. So I think just in general Matt, we feel real good about the current state of our business and demand for our products including brakes.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. And then on wheel hub, I noticed I guess it's down for the second quarter in a row here. That has been sort of in a bit of decline in the last year. Maybe just speak to sort of the dynamics that are happening there. I think there was some seasonality in the last few quarters, but maybe just could you talk about the dynamics at play with the wheel hub business.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yeah I think that business is slightly slower right now, not sure exactly why. Just you know unfortunately, there's no real specific data that says it should be slow or fast. Ultimately, it should grow. But overall again, I go back to the overall just the environment out there is positive for product lines. And hopefully we'll see resumption on the wheel hub growth. Can't give you too much insight other than we expect it to grow just been unseasonably a little bit slower.\nMatt Koranda: Okay, got it. And then just implied in the growth outlook that you have for the year, it's high single digit percentage growth for the back half if I can use the midpoint of the guidance you've given. You guys have put in place like a decent amount of price and taken several rounds of pricing. To my knowledge, I assume also you'd probably get some volume lift. Maybe just could you speak to how much lift you think you're going to get from price in the back half of the year versus volume? And then just maybe any commentary selling on inventory positions at your customers. Where do they sit in terms of being maybe in line with where you need them to be versus why you are a little heavy?\nSelwyn Joffe: Okay. A lot of pieces in that question. I mean let's just talk about pricing. And we talked about pricing making up for the increased interest rates. I mean we're very comfortable that that's going to happen. We will see incremental pricing in the next quarters that have already been committed to. And we remain committed to passing on inflationary costs, whether it’d be in interest or other expenses through. And so whatever that ends up being it will end up being. But we do have good visibility on our already approved pricing increases. The other side of it is volume for all of our products is up. And we were off to a good start this quarter. And we expect volume to continue to be driven. We've talked about the fundamentals of the aftermarket and then the tailwinds and an aging car fleet. Average age continues to go up miles driven as it continues to be positive. And so these cars are going to fail and need non-discretionary parts that we're talking about. So, I don't see any product lines that we have in decline mode. I mean I do see obviously wheel hubs, but there's no fundamental that says that wheel hubs will not recover. So, all of our product lines look good. I think as we ramp up and experience these greater margins I mean these quarters are becoming more the norm for us. And we have better overhead absorption, our efficiency get better. And as we take on new business which again, we expect to take on over the next I mean hopefully for the foreseeable future, we should see margin accretion, we should see volume growth and we should see positive cash flow. Inventory, we're building a little bit of inventory right now. I mean just because the outlook for our sales is very positive. And so to keep up with that, we're building inventory. We do have new business that we're ramping up for as well. So, there will be some inventory increase. I do expect receivables to come down in time as we go forward. So the actual cash flow will be seen. We'll catch up the collections of receivables. We have the option to take it whenever we want to. They're sitting there waiting for us. So liquidity is as strong as it's ever been and we expect to see that in the positive cash flow numbers.\nMatt Koranda: Okay.\nSelwyn Joffe: I don't know, if I answered all your questions. There was a lot in your questions.\nMatt Koranda: Yeah I'm good at asking a thousand questions embedded – okay. So as pricing action complete at this point I guess we put there so many rounds. Are there more to come? Can you help us understand the timing of anything incremental that you're doing?\nSelwyn Joffe: Well, I think for sure you'll see more price increases in this current quarter that are still rolling in and even some more in the fourth quarter. For now that's correct. But I mean again depending on inflationary costs we'll monitor it and we'll have to see. I mean, hopefully, interest rates stabilize it looks like. But if we see increases there we intend to increase prices to make up for it.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Got it. Just a couple more quick ones. So the outlook, if I look at the implied margin in the back half of your year looks like you're assuming that it gets a little worse than what you put up in the second quarter. But I'm just -- with all the pricing that you put through the volume lift you're getting, maybe some mix benefits and cost absorption why should it be the case that margins erode relative to the second quarter?\nSelwyn Joffe: Look, we're being very conservative. It's just that simple. I mean, there should be no reason. We're sitting here. We're experiencing extreme tailwinds to our business positive things to our business. At the same time, we've been very cautious about changing the outlook, but things look positive for us right now. Then there's no reason that it should get worse.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. And then just lastly, can you level set everybody on cash flow expectations for the rest of the year? I know you deferred or you said, you deferred like $15 million. And AR collection so that's a good guy for the third quarter maybe just speak to can we expect positive cash flow from operations in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of this year? And then maybe just if you want to thread in or talk about any of the inventory or AR dynamics that we should think about for the rest of the year as it pertains to working capital.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yeah. So working capital neutrality is probably becoming a buzzword for NPA internally. So first of all, let me answer your question is yes we expect positive cash flow for the back six months. We generated $30 million, essentially generated $30 million in the first six months. We don't know why we couldn't do that in the back six months, that we will have to wait and see. The other side of it is, I mean, increased gross margins increased EBITDA increased work on days outstanding on payables and neutralizing working capital. Yes, there will be some growth in working capital for the new business that comes on no question about that. But that will be quickly reversed as that new business kicks in and the sales kick in from that. But again, we're very focused on cash flow. We're very focused on stable growth. And we expect things to continue on this trend line.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Appreciate all the answers. So I'll leave it there.\nSelwyn Joffe: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nWilliam Dossett: Hey, good afternoon. This is William Dossett on for Brian. Thank you for taking our questions. So you've discussed that demand remained strong and that's consistent with the update that you gave back in August. Can you just discuss probably the drivers of the strength? And I wanted to ask about for guidance any range of outcomes that you've potentially embedded and perhaps the key areas of upside and downside?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yeah. So again, what's driving our business is number one we continue to have great market share. Number two, we have price increases. And the most important piece is that the fundamentals of the aftermarket continue to be really strong. And our customers' inventory level someone asked I didn't answer that properly in the last question, I'll address it now. Customers need inventory. And this is non-discretionary parts when the consumer needs to replace that part. The customer has it. We don't believe that there's excess inventory in the channel at all. We think there's still opportunity for growth in inventory in the channel quite frankly. And so that's another tailwind. And the average age of the car park continues to go up. Miles driven seems to be at least stable to positive. And so I just -- I don't see -- we have as an industry every now and again you get a blip in a product demand and people try and describe what that is but that's somewhat of an unknown. But overall these cars need these replacements and they're going to have it. And so I think there's overall strength everywhere for us. I think the upsides for us new business opportunities that we have and that we were ramping up for. So there's upside there. I think there's upside in the margin opportunity. Clearly, from price increases, but also from overall production efficiencies. Challenges are you never know again whether it can cause short-term blips. There's always a risk that you can lose business, but we hope we're not on that side of it and we don't expect that. But overall, we've used the outlook for our business very positively right now.\nWilliam Dossett: Thank you for that. And to follow-up just on your point, have you seen any short-term blips that you suspect that there has been at all any deferral amid higher inflation? And then to that point, is there any point at which you think price elasticity comes into play just with the cost increases for purchases?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yeah. So I mean, we've had blips and then we've had some large customers have had some challenges and that they're coming out of that and they're still coming out of that. So there's some more upside in that. So that has caused some blips for us. I mean our fundamentals for our business have been really strong, but we had some unusual customer blip now last fiscal year. So we see the back of that. We are optimistic that all of our customers continue to be strong. I think we see a little slower ramp up and now some parts of our brake business, but very strong. But that's because of some slowdown and changeovers but we expect that to recover. So again, I think overall, there's some deferral in demand in our product lines. I think that's coming. But again, the day-to-day fundamentals the registered fundamentals that we see for our product lines, but really positive. In terms of price elasticity, we have non-discretionary products. So I mean to the extent that these products cost more and that's validated I mean we expect that that demand should not be affected by price increases. I think that overall the consumer choices to either repair the vehicle or scrap it. And if you look at the relative value of the vehicle versus the repair the repair makes all the sense in the world unless they're absolutely unable to make a repair then that have to resort to public transportation. But we see the non-discretionary nature basically overcoming any pricing obstacles or short-term pricing obstacles and that those prices can be pushed through and should stick. And the disproportionate value of the repairs still very much positive for the consumer and then alternative starters et cetera, et cetera the cost of them compared to the value of the vehicles and the alternatives are miniscule. So we see plenty of upside.\nWilliam Dossett: That's very helpful. So another question that I wanted to touch on was from our team regarding factoring in interest rates. On that topic, you've all called out price increases for the third and fourth quarters to help compensate for the higher interest rates. Can you discuss MPA's ability to pass on these higher costs to customers? And as you've done with the election not to draw down on the factoring last quarter, what tools can you use to mitigate and manage these higher interest expense?\nSelwyn Joffe: Look, there's not a lot of tools that we see out there to manage the high interest. It is what it is. I mean at the end of the day, we feel that we deserve a fair price and that includes charging for these interest rates. And so these are certainly the accelerated interest rates. And so we have been passing through, it's never easy to get price increases, but we absolutely must have them. I mean I think every supplier must have them, because I mean this is a true cost that's a cash cost. And so we need to make up for it. So I think we'll continue to pass them through and from where we are right now and hopefully they at least stay stable and eventually start moving downwards. But we intend to pass it through. And unfortunately, this is part of the -- all costs get eventually passed onto the consumer. The consumer makes a judgment on whether you will continue to spend on that particular product. In our case, it's non-discretionary and the value quotient is extremely positive even with the price increase.\nWilliam Dossett: And to quickly follow up on that this forthcoming price increases in Q3 and Q4, did they compensate you for the current level of interest rate? And one reason I ask is to be able to understand, what's the likelihood of future cost increases in terms of marketplace?\nSelwyn Joffe: We're not there yet. I mean, that compensates for a lot of the increase, but we think we should be getting more. I mean again, I'd just say that as an industry participant, I'm not advocating that we're going to get or not going to get. I'm going to have to wait and see. But again, we believe that these, the factoring rates extend the term for the customer and the customer has to pay for those extended terms, and the working capital costs. And I don't think I'm unique in that feeling. I think that the entire supply chain feels that way. So while it's a difficult discussion, I think it's one that's pretty clear. And so I think that everybody need strong suppliers out there and the consumer needs to have products. I mean, if a goal goes down for the consumer, the consumer needs these products to keep their vehicles on the road. If not for companies like ourselves, the car park would be substantially damaged in terms of being able to be repaired. So the entire aftermarket or supply chain needs to be able to -- needs to be viable. And that includes the cost of interest.\nWilliam Dossett: Thank you for that. And the last question if I may from marketing was just on the framing the opportunity, the longer term opportunity from some of these focuses that are beyond the more mature hard part business, which is the I guess great opportunity in Mexico emerging product lines such as brake related product categories and power management in EV, you mind discussing that?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yeah. I think look let me start with the JBT-1, which is this rotating electrical alternator and we've started to test them. And we have orders now backorders on that I mean firm orders for over 3,000 units there. That product line has proven to be extremely successful and we're starting to see more and more benefit from that coming. So that's a very significant piece of business and we expect double triple or even quadruple that amount of demand to unfold in the next 12 months. So that part of the business, we think is going to be extremely strong and we're very excited about it. I think we have an industry leading product. And the customers that have embraced it are seeing huge successes from it and are committed to it, so very exciting there. I think the electric vehicle diagnostics what's a little more choppy in that CapEx budgets keep getting pushed back or there's a lot of, sort of, a little bit of negative discussion on the EV growth right now. So again that bodes well for combustion engine perceptions quite frankly. I think the perceptions whatever they are, we've got 30 years there's no at least in the combustion engine opportunity of tailwinds quite frankly. I think it will keep getting better. But anyhow just to talk EV talk for a little bit but the EV market is sporadic. The demand for our testers, our emulators, simulators continues to be good. It's not as easy to predict quarterly volume on that. Some of these projects are longer. What is exciting though is that Detroit test center, which is a software-as-a-solution test center is seeing a lot of -- there's a lot of demand for that. In fact that we've got reservations now that books up that facility for 120 days out. So that's pretty exciting. Margins are very good in that business. And electric power management is a fast evolving big demand category. And whether it be for the automotive aftermarket, but we're seeing a lot of it in drone technology and in aerospace. So I think for longer term down the road that's going to be quite exciting to us and especially selling computer time for our solutions will be a big part of that. We've recently put in a new CEO into that role on electric controller, a heavy technology person. And he's worked for us in the past but he has come through the ranks and he's taken over there. And we're excited about the opportunities there as well.\nWilliam Dossett: Thanks so much. Best of luck.\nSelwyn Joffe: Thank you very much. Appreciate your interest.\nOperator: There appear to be no further questions at this time. Gary Maier, I turn the call back over to you.\nSelwyn Joffe: Okay. I just want to say in summary we're excited about a fiscal second half that's coming up. It's supported by strong demand for replacement parts and aging car park, opportunities from multiple replacements has caused down the road longer. We've built a solid platform for growth and a non-discretionary aftermarket products serve a critical need for customers and consumers. And most importantly in closing, I want to recognize the contributions from our all of our management team and all of our team members who are focused every day on providing the highest level of service. We're all committed to being the industry leader for parts and solutions that move our world today and in the future. And we thank everybody for your continued support and thank you again for joining us for the call. And we look forward to speaking with you when we host our fiscal 2024 third-quarter call in February and in our investor conferences. So thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Motorcar Parts of America – I would like to welcome everyone to the Motorcar Parts of America Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Gary Maier, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nGary Maier: Thank you, Brian.

For a more detailed discussion of some of the ongoing risks and uncertainties of the company’s business, I refer you to our various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I’d like to begin our call and turn it over to Selwyn.\nSelwyn Joffe: Thank you, Gary. I appreciate everyone joining us today. We are still on track to achieve our year-over-year targets, notwithstanding the timing of orders and softness in April due to a very rainy and cooler March, as reported by the retailers. We saw a strong recovery in the May, June months and sales continue to be robust. Also, I may note the fiscal second quarter is off to an excellent start based on record sales for a July month. Industry trends and extreme hard weather across the country support our optimism. Equally important, we are seeing improved operational efficiencies starting to materialize, enhanced by increasing sales volume, particularly from our emerging brick-related product lines. These operating efficiency improvements, along with increased overhead absorption from higher sales and production and price increases all bode well for margin expansion. I might add that following the completion of the second quarter, on a run-rate basis, all price increases will be recognized. We remain focused on leveraging our strengths, including our solid customer relationships, highly regarded product quality, range of applications and performance, not to mention our value-added merchandising and marketing support. With respect to gross margins, we expect improvement as fiscal 2024 evolves. We anticipate benefits from current order volume improvement, operating efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives that we continue to implement across the entire organization. It is important to understand that product mix affects our gross margin, but that gross profit dollars should increase from all categories as a result of our initiatives. Also noteworthy, margins on our newly launched product lines tend to be lower than mature products until we grow into our capacity and develop the efficiencies that come with time. In addition, we are exploring potential strategic partnerships for our electric vehicle operation. High-interest rates continue to have a significant impact on profitability, primarily due to rates related to long-established customer supply chain finance programs. To offset these interest expenses, we have received price increases from customers, which will be fully implemented this quarter. Besides the price increases we have – as we have previously discussed, we are looking for ways to reduce interest expense by enhancing cash flow. We are focused on neutralizing working capital as much as possible. Our initiatives include increasing gross profit and operating income, managing our inventory as a percentage of sales and implementing programs to extend days outstanding on accounts payable. We still expect sales for fiscal 2024 to be between $720 million and $740 million, representing between 5.4% and 8.3% year-over-year growth, respectively. Also, we expect to see further margin accretion from efficiencies related to the higher volume and cost-cutting initiatives, as I noted earlier in my remarks. With respect to cash flow, our expectation is to continue to make progress to generate cash. David will expand upon this in a few minutes. Regarding year-end guidance, we expect operating income before the impact of the non-cash and cash items and before depreciation and amortization to be between $90 million and $95 million. To provide more details, before the non-cash foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts, the non-cash impact of revaluation pools and customer shells and supply chain disruptions, operating income for fiscal 2024 is expected to be between $60 million and $65 million. We estimate other non-cash items will be approximately $16 million, which include core and finished goods premium amortization and share-based compensation. And cash expenses are expected to be approximately $2 million for specialty EV-related research and development expenses, which impact operating income. Depreciation and amortization are estimated to be approximately $12 million. In short, as fiscal 2024 evolves, we expect our gross margins across the board to increase and enhance cash flow. Our multiyear strategic initiatives and favorable industry dynamics bode well for the company, and we are extremely well positioned for sustained top and bottom line growth in our hard parts business as well as testing solutions. Now let me expand a bit further and provide some updates to the other drivers of our business to support our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets. We continue to experience meaningful traction with customers and consumers with the launch of our break-related product lines, with operating efficiency improvements continuing as volume increases and with the fixed cost absorption. We are continuing to expand hard part sales in Mexico with multiple product lines as our customers experience increased demand for aftermarket parts. We are receiving increasing orders and new customer interest for our test solutions and diagnostic equipment, in particular, desktop testers were alternated and starters from major automotive retailers and distributors to the professional installers. Major global automotive, aerospace and research institutions for electric product development and design, continue to purchase our equipment and/or utilize our Detroit tech center for testing services. In short, we continue to be well positioned to address both the internal combustion engine market and the emerging electric vehicle market with product functionality and applications across both markets. Industry data continues to support our view that strong demand for internal combustion engine applications and our broad line of non-discretionary aftermarket parts will be here for decades. Notwithstanding electric vehicle growth, which still represents a small percentage of the overall car park. I’ll now turn the call over to David to review our results in greater detail.\nDavid Lee: Thank you, Selwyn, and good morning, everyone. I encourage everyone to read the earnings press release issued this morning as well as the 10-Q that will be filed later today. Let me now provide a review of our fiscal first quarter financial results. Net sales for the fiscal ‘24 first quarter were $159.7 million compared with $164 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting timing of orders. Gross profit for the fiscal ‘24 first quarter was $26.6 million compared with $30.3 million a year earlier. Gross profit for the quarter was impacted by non-cash items as well as cash items. Let me provide details for each, and then I will provide further details on the impact on each additional line item so you can further understand the underlying fundamentals between periods and the opportunities to enhance profitability. The non-cash items reflects core and finished good premium amortization and revaluation of cores on customer shelves, which are unique to certain of our products and required by GAAP. The total for these noncash items in the quarter was approximately $3.4 million. A more detailed explanation of core accounting is available on our website, and I would encourage anyone with questions about this topic to review the video. First quarter gross margin was 16.6% compared with 18.5% a year earlier. Gross margin was impacted by 2.2% from the previously mentioned non-cash items as well as 1% from cash items. In summary, in addition to the non-cash and cash items explained previously, gross margin for the fiscal ‘24 first quarter were impacted by inflationary costs not yet covered by price increases, higher per unit costs resulting from less absorption of overhead costs due to lower production volume, higher returns as a percentage of sales and changes in product mix. Let me emphasize that price increases will enhance gross margins. Furthermore, gross margins will be enhanced by higher sales volume, which we are experiencing, and that will increase over the absorption, lower the returns as a percentage of sales and further enhanced operating efficiencies. Operating expenses were down $6.8 million for the quarter to $16.1 million from $23 million in the prior year period. This included a non-cash gain of $4.3 million with the foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and Florida contracts compared with a prior year non-cash loss of $678,000. The remaining $1.9 million of operating expense decreases included cost reduction initiatives.\nExhibit 1: Results for the fiscal first quarter were impacted by $4.8 million or $0.18 per share of higher interest expenses, primarily due to higher market interest rates. Interest expense was $11.7 million compared with $6.9 million for last year. We have received meaningful annualized price increases, which will contribute to net income enhancement. Income tax benefit was $9,000 compared with income tax expense of $589,000 for the same period a year ago. I should mention that the effective tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was affected in part due to the inability to recognize the benefit of losses at specific foreign jurisdictions. However, we expect these losses will be utilized against future profits, which will benefit future tax rates. In short, there are various factors impacting the tax effect. EBITDA for the first quarter was $13.3 million, EBITDA was impacted by $615,000 of non-cash items and impacted by $2.3 million in cash items. EBITDA before the impact of non-cash and cash items mentioned above, was $16.3 million for the first quarter. In addition to the above non-cash and cash items, EBITDA for the first quarter was impacted by the items impacting gross margin previously explained. In summary, further EBITDA improvement for fiscal ‘24 is expected as the full benefit of certain price increases is realized and with higher sales volume in addition to cost reduction initiatives. Now we will move on to cash flow and key corporate items. Notwithstanding the use of cash for the quarter of $20.5 million to support operating activities, the company expects a positive reversal in the fiscal second quarter. As we noted in our press release this morning, we strategically elected to lower collections of receivables by approximately $20 million paid through our customer offer and supply chain finance programs during the fiscal first quarter.  The company expects a positive reversal in the fiscal second quarter. As we noted in our press release this morning, we strategically elected to lower collections of receivables by approximately $20 million paid through our customer offered supply chain finance programs during the fiscal first quarter. This resulted in interest savings of approximately $1.3 million and enabled us to defer interest expenses until price increases for interest rates are recognized. I should emphasize that the company’s strong liquidity allowed us to execute this strategy. And additionally, subsequent to quarter end, paid down the company’s $11.25 million term loan. Interest rates on the term loan were approximately 2% higher than rates offered by the company’s customer supply chain vendor finance programs. In short, we will continue throughout the year to monitor interest expense level and opportunities to reduce interest based on the timing of monetizing customer payments. The terms are 360 days to the customers and we can elect when to be paid through the customer supply chain vendor finance programs offered, and we pay the proportional discount rate. We expect to generate an increase in operating profit on a year-over-year basis for fiscal ‘24, supported by organic growth from customer demand and operating efficiencies from a now completed footprint expansion and generate positive cash flows for fiscal ‘24. In addition to our goal of generating increased operating profits, we are diligently focused on opportunities to neutralize working capital growth, including customer product demand planning, enhanced inventory management and improving vendor payment terms. Our investments are and will further bear fruit, and we are gratified by the ongoing success of our expanded operations in Mexico and the growth momentum of our emerging brake categories, along with expectations of increasing financial performance from both new and existing product lines. Our net debt at the end of the quarter, excluding our convertible note, was approximately $168 million, while total cash and availability on the revolving credit facility was approximately $76 million after certain contractual adjustments. Lastly, we recently entered into a seventh amendment to our credit facility, including paying down the outstanding balance of our term loan and eliminating the senior leverage ratio covenant as of June 30, 2023. Our liquidity after paying down the term loan remains strong and north of $75 million. For further explanation on the reconciliation of items that impacted results and non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Exhibit 1 through 3 in this morning’s earnings press release. I would now like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Koranda from ROTH MKM. Your line is open.\nMatthew Koranda: Hi, guys good morning. So, just – I will start with the traditional question, which is for David. What – can you give the product breakdown within the quarter between rotating electrical, wheel hubs and brake products?\nDavid Lee: Yes, Matt, for the first quarter, rotating electrical was 64% of sales. Brakes were 22% - brake related products were 22%, wheel hubs 11% and others was 3%.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. So, 64% – sorry, I am trying to do this on the fly here, 64%, what wheel hubs?\nDavid Lee: 11%.\nMatthew Koranda: And then break hub – or sorry, break related products?\nDavid Lee: 22%.\nMatthew Koranda: 22%. Got it. Okay. Other 3%, so it seems like the bulk of the decline in the quarter comes from rotating electrical and wheel hub at least sequentially and then on a year-over-year basis, if we look at that, it looks like wheel hub is a little bit weak. Maybe just speak to the trends you saw during the quarter and sort of why the shortfall there?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. So, I will start just again. When you have rainy weather and cooler weather at the retailers reported in March, the replenishment on those items slows down in the following month. And so April slowed down in those items. But we see a resurgence of that. I will say along with that, Matt, is we have got significant momentum in our break-related products. So, that will continue to grow. We do expect rotating electrical to continue to grow as well, that we have a little bit of a softness going into the first quarter. Now, for hot weather, and you should see rotating electrical sales in extreme hot weather, so that should be driver going forward. And I will say just on the margin perspective is that our – the margin pressure is not on the legacy products. I mean the margin pressure is just because of new and emerging product lines that are coming up. And as those volumes get better, I mean we are already starting to see improvement in operating efficiencies in those product lines. And those product lines are getting more and more momentum. So, we expect a very strong back nine months. And I think I reiterated the guidance that we have. I think a lot of this is just a little bit of timing that the sales are a little lower than what you expected. But we expect to be ahead of your numbers for the year.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Maybe in that vein and you mentioned the hotter weather sell-in more recently. Could you speak to July order trends and just the visibility that gives you into 2Q growth and how we should be thinking about the front quarter here in terms of top line growth?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. I mean the July is off to – I mean July is an all-time record July for us I mean – and probably one of the higher months ever. But – so we are off to a very strong side with really good visibility for the rest of the quarter, along with good cash flow metrics. I mean we were able to pay-down our debt and maintain our availability. So, a lot of that was paid off with just the collections and so – and eliminates one covenant. So, I think overall, and certainly, we are feeling very positive about the outlook for the next nine months.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Any thoughts on seasonality? You reiterated the full year guide, so that does require a pretty pickup in growth, so maybe just speak to and level set folks on seasonality expected during the year.\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. I think that’s a great question. I mean I think again, I think the second quarter is going to be real strong. I mean as everyone is expecting, and we are certainly expecting that. We probably expect your third quarter numbers. We think the third quarter will be a little higher than what’s expected right now, and the fourth quarter is always good for us. So, we think the back nine months should be very strong. Now, lots of work to be done and lots of variables out there, but the indications are that the remaining nine months should be very, very strong for us.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. And then just maybe one more on the pricing environment. You talked about pricing for the factoring expense. Has all of that been put into effect as of now, what was the last round of price increases that you did to factor in unintended the expense that you have got on the interest expense line?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. So, most of it has been put into effect. Now, there is still another $3 million to $4 million of price increases that will be in effect soon, very soon in the next couple of weeks.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Got it. And then you mentioned the drag on gross margin is most likely related to sort of the brake products ramp up. What do you think the differential is there in gross margin between brake products versus the core rotating electrical and wheel hub product lines that you have? And when do we get to like a normalized data being here? Can we do it this year, or is it more likely next?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. We can’t give you, unfortunately, granular data on the actual margins. But the only sort of thing I would tell you is that those margins continue to increase and they are all positive. And so each quarter, we are seeing sequential improvement overall. And a lot of it is overall absorption of we have now consolidated freight where things are combined, there is some consolidated operations. And so it’s very difficult to give you that number. We don’t report by product line. But I think the important thing for people to understand is that the core margins are intact and the core business is intact. We expect that to continue to grow even though you sometimes see fluctuations and some softness in rotating electrical, but it will continue to grow. And the other businesses are growing. Now, the brake-related business is growing disproportionately, it’s brand new. So, when you see that growth. And so that affects overall margins, but incremental gross profit contribution should continue to go up from all of those. And so, I think it’s important that people understand that.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Fair enough. I guess I lied, one more on just cash management and working capital. Maybe just speak to where should inventory balance or days on hand be for the remainder of the year? I know last year, it peaked in Q1 and then kind of came down slowly on the inventory balance. Is that the same sort of seasonality we should expect this year? And then on AR, I mean it continues to tick up. Is there a point at which we just hit the collection button on sort of – on some of the receivables and that balance drops, or should we continue to expect the DSOs to kind of tick higher for the rest of the year?\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes. No. So, I will address receivables, I will give, David the hard one, which is inventory. The receivables, we have the option of generally retail days outstanding of 30 days because of the factoring. And so receivables tick up there is only directly related to one of two things. I mean that sales are growing and the timing of the sales – the timing of sales for our first quarter, this one we were reporting on got very strong as we got through the quarter, so you see receivables going up and we elected not to collect 20 – $20-plus million of cash because we could save the interest expense. We expect receivable – I mean again, we expect to – as these prices go in, not to defer receivable collections because that’s not what we want to do. I mean we are always looking at minimizing interest. But the last three quarters of this year are all expected to be very strong. And so I think you will start seeing a normalized receivable balance as we get through the end of this quarter. And that’s – again, I think days outstanding, now I will also mention that while we don’t sell receivables to the professional installer market doesn’t have that program, and we continue to grow pretty significantly there. So, those receivables days outstanding are a little bit longer, but there is no interest rate, external interest rate. So, as that – that number also effects the days outstanding on the receivables. And we have had some success really significant success in the rotors and pads business as well continues to grow pretty significantly. But both parts of that business, both – all of our business is growing, I am happy to say that. And so I think overall, with a lot of mumbo jumbo I am going through here, but I am thinking a lot. Overall, I would say that receivables should stabilize as we get to the end of this quarter because the remaining three quarters all will be strong, should be strong.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. And then maybe, David, on…\nSelwyn Joffe: Yes.\nDavid Lee: Thanks for that question. Yes. You will recall, we increased inventory for three reasons. To support the demand in new business, address supply chain disruptions and support expansion of our brake-related products. We are seeing increased demand for all of our product lines. So, going forward, you are going to see that inventory as a percentage of sales coming down. So, as our sales momentum keeps growing, that inventory as a percentage of that growth will be coming down.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Selwyn Joffe, I will turn the call back over to you.\nSelwyn Joffe: Okay. In summary, we are excited about the quarters ahead. As I have mentioned, supported by strong demand for replacement parts and aging car park as well and opportunities for multiple replacements as cost down the road longer, equally relevant is the miles-driven growth rate for the first six months of 2023, which was 2.3%. Industry observers expect that we will surpass the pre-pandemic growth rate of 1.6%, reached in the 2017-2019, 3-year period. In short, we have a built-in solid platform for growth, and our non-discretionary aftermarket products have a critical need for customers and consumers. And in closing, I must recognize the contributions of all of our team members who are focused every day on providing the highest level of service. We are all committed to being the industry leader for parts and solutions that move our world today and in the future. We appreciate your continued support and we thank you again for joining us for this call. We look forward to speaking with you when we host our fiscal 2024 second quarter call in November and at future investor conferences. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect."
