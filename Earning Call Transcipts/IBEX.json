After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's is being recorded. To note, there is an accompanying earnings deck presentation available on the IBEX Investor Relations website at investors.ibex.co. I will now turn this conference over to Mr. Michael Darwal, Investor Relations of IBEX.\nMichael Darwal: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I want to remind you that matters discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements related to our operating performance, financial goals and business outlook, which are based on management's current beliefs and assumptions. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to revise this information as a result of new developments, which may occur. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected and described today. For a more detailed description of our risk factors, please review our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 13, 2023. As a reminder, as of July 1, 2023, we became a domestic filer and as such are now reporting on a U.S. GAAP basis rather than from the previous IFRS standard. With that, I will now turn the call over to IBEX CEO, Bob Dechant.\nBob Dechant: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today as we share our second quarter fiscal 2024 results. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have made strategic investments into our building blocks for our next phase of growth, efforts which are now coming to fruition in terms of size, speed, and quality of our new logo, pipeline, and wins. I am very excited to report we had eight new client wins in the quarter, totaling 12 for the first half of FY2024 as compared to seven for the first half of FY2023. This tracks similarly to the velocity of our new client wins we had in FY2022, our banner year for new logos. These wins include several high-profile deals with Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 clients, opportunities we won head-to-head against our multibillion-dollar competitors. Beyond this, we have continued to have success with exciting new economy brands. These wins span our strategic verticals of HealthTech and Retail and E-Commerce and AI technology. Stepping back and looking at these deals and our key pipeline opportunities, I am seeing that AI capabilities are playing a key role in client decision-making as they look for BPO partners, who can not only deliver great contact center services, but also rapidly deploy disruptive AI-based solutions. Our recent accomplishments highlight our ability to succeed on both fronts and positions us well as we move forward. This momentum is continuing into our second half with wins and great opportunities with premier brands in Q3. Although our new logo engine continues to build strength for future growth, the combination of softer volumes with several embedded base clients and the transition of significant client volume from our onshore to offshore regions led to lower top-line revenue in the quarter. Revenues came in at $132.6 million, down 4.8% from prior year. The impact of this, coupled with planned investments in three key areas, including our sales organization, our AI initiative, and our integrated HCM/ERP systems, resulted in a decline in adjusted EBITDA to $14.3 million from $19.4 million in Q2 FY2023. Additionally, we had a $2.3 million adverse impact associated with the recognition of deferred training revenue to both top and bottom line results when comparing to prior year quarter. As previously noted, when we are going through significant ramps for new wins, we defer training revenues associated with those ramps over the term of the program while recognizing the full training costs in the current period. While new client wins and ramps have a long-term positive impact for the business, the initial launches have a short term negative impact. IBEX continues to optimize its footprint and capacity utilization through a combination of shifting volume mix toward our offshore geographies as well as right sizing our onshore and nearshore footprints. Since the start of the fiscal year, capacity utilization has increased in each of our regions, driven by the combination of shifting mix and the site rationalizations we undertook in the second half of fiscal year 2023. We exited December at 91% utilization of our seat capacity globally, including work-at-home, up from 77% as of June 2023. Our onshore delivery now represents less than 23% of revenue versus 27% same quarter a year ago, and our offshore markets now make up nearly 50% versus less than 43% a year ago. It is these shifts that give us confidence in our expectations for appreciable margin improvement starting in Q3, FY2024. I would like to spend a few minutes talking about our plan to accelerate our leadership position in deploying AI-based solutions. Recently, we announced the hiring of industry veteran, Eric Guarro as our Senior Vice President of Digital Transformation. In his newly appointed role, Guarro, will spearhead the strategy and execution of IBEX's digital transformation offering aimed at reshaping customer and brand interactions through the seamless integration of cutting-edge contact center solutions and AI-enabled technologies. This is one of the several strategic investments we continue to make in support of our three axis strategy for deploying AI for our clients to improve performance, cost and the customer experience. Last quarter, I discussed a disruptive solution we are deploying for smart IVRs, conversational chat and voice bots for an important new client win. With Eric leading the charge, we have developed a robust pipeline across all three axis and we continue to win new opportunities and deployments. As an example, we are implementing a solution for deep AI-driven analytics for a top healthcare company leveraging Anna AI. The goal is to redefine the patient experience by leveraging AI-powered quality and sentiment analysis of every interaction to rapidly identify drivers of dissatisfaction. AI technology also creates opportunities for us on the client front. We are very excited about a new client win with an AI wearables technology pioneer who has developed the first wearable device and software platform to build and harness the full power of AI. We are working shoulder-to-shoulder with our client to bring this product and service successfully to market and to define an amazing customer experience. It is these exciting wins that showcase our differentiation and our first mover position in AI. From a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to execute on our share buyback program which we announced last September, driven by the current valuation and our confidence in the trajectory of IBEX. Since we announced the program, we have acquired more than 700,000 shares back. This continues to be an attractive and efficient use of our capital. We continue to evaluate new markets for expansion whether organically or through acquisition. We have an enviable net cash position of $48 million, giving IBEX the flexibility to constructively use and make targeted investments for growth. In closing, the BPO industry is at an inflection point where the winners will transform their businesses into higher value solutions powered by AI. We believe we can be a long-term winner leveraging our speed, flexibility and tech led D&A [ph]. Our early results are encouraging. My team and I remained ever focused on continued strengthening of the business and delivering value for our employees, clients and shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Taylor to go through our financials. Taylor?\nTaylor Greenwald: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. My discussions of our second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results references to revenue, net income and net cash generated from operations are on a U.S. GAAP basis, while adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of our U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the tables attached to our earnings press release. Our second quarter results were impacted by softer than anticipated contact volume in some of our embedded base business, as well as the year-over-year impact of the shifting mix from onshore to offshore delivery. These impacts, combined with a changing business environment for several of our FinTech and telecommunications clients, resulted in revenue of $132.6 million, a 4.8% decline compared to $139.3 million in the prior year quarter. Looking at revenue in total, revenue declines in the FinTech and telecommunication verticals were partially offset by growth in our strategic HealthTech and retail and e-commerce verticals. Revenue mix continued to trend toward digital and omnichannel services and offshore geographies. Digital and omnichannel delivery now represents 79% of our total revenue versus 73% in the second quarter a year ago, while our offshore and nearshore revenues now comprise 77% of total revenue versus 73% in the prior year quarter. We expect that these mix shift trends will have a positive impact on margins over time. Another significant factor in year-over-year revenue was the adverse impact of the recognition of training revenue associated with new client program ramps [ph]. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, revenue associated with training, although billed at the beginning of a new program, is deferred and recognized over the expected life of the program. Deferred training revenue had a 2.3 million adverse impact to revenue when comparing our second quarter with the prior year. Deferred revenue that was recognized in the second quarter was 1.7 million lower than compared to the prior year quarter, while training revenue billed and deferred in the second quarter was 600,000 higher than the prior year quarter. This not only impacted revenue but also negatively impacted gross margin comparisons versus the prior year. Gross margin was 27.7% versus 28.4% in the prior year. Normalizing for this deferred training revenue impact, gross margin was up roughly 100 basis points from the prior year, reflecting improvement from our increasing offshore revenue mix. Net income was $6.1 million compared to $9.3 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily a result of the impact of deferred training revenue previously discussed, as well as our strategic investments in our technology, including HCM and ERP infrastructure, and our sales and marketing organizations. These investments are important pieces of our strategy to drive and support growth in our business. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17% compared to 18% last year. We expect the tax rate to remain in the high teens for the fiscal year. Fully diluted EPS was $0.33 compared to $0.49 in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis. adjusted net income was $8 million compared to $12.2 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP fully diluted adjusted earnings per share were $0.44 compared to $0.65 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.3 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 13.9% of revenue for the same period last year. The change in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by the accounting for deferred train revenue as well as investments in our technology, including HCM and ERP infrastructure, and our sales and marketing organizations in support of our strategic vertical growth strategy. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, our top five, top ten and top 25 client concentrations remain largely flat at 41%, 59% and 82%, respectively of overall revenue representative of a well diversified client portfolio. Switching to our verticals, retail and ecommerce increased to 29.0% of second quarter revenue versus 26.9% in the prior year quarter. Health tech increased to 12.2% of second quarter revenue versus 8.7% in the prior year quarter, and travel, transportation and logistics increased to 12.5% of second quarter revenue versus 11.4% in the prior year quarter. Conversely, our exposure to the telecommunications vertical decreased to 14.8% of quarterly revenue versus 16.7% in the prior year quarter. Additionally, FinTech decreased to 13.7% of revenue for the quarter versus 19.2% in the prior year quarter, impacted by the changing landscape for crypto and new economy investment platform clients. Net cash generated from operating activities was a negative $1.6 million for the quarter compared to a positive $5.3 million in the prior year quarter. For the first half of our fiscal year, operating cash flow was a positive $7 million versus $10.9 million. Our DSOs were 73 days, up from 67 days at the end of the first quarter and in line with industry average. Several larger client payments were received in the first week of January and negatively impacted DSOs at the end of the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $2.9 million, or 2.2% of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 versus $7.9 million, or 5.7% of revenue in the prior year quarter as we continued to utilize our available capacity from build outs completed in previous years. Free cash flow decreased to a negative $4.5 million in the current quarter compared to a negative $2.7 million in the prior year quarter due to lower income from operations and higher DSOs. For the first half of our fiscal year, free cash flow was a positive $2.1 million versus a negative $700,000 in the prior year. We ended the second quarter with $49 million in cash, down from $57.4 million as of June 2023 driven by share repurchases during the quarter. Net cash was $48.0 million, down from $56.4 million as of June 2023. We continued with our share repurchase program announced on September 18, 2023 authorizing us to repurchase up to $30 million worth of shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 489,000 shares for $8.4 million. For fiscal year-to-date through January 31, 2024 we've repurchased 740,000 shares for a total cost of $12.5 million.  Looking forward to the remainder of 2024, we expect softness in some of our client volumes to continue for the near term and therefore expect third quarter revenues to trend similarly as the first two quarters on a year-over-year basis. As our new client ramps reach scale in the fourth quarter, we anticipate an inflection towards growth. We remain confident that our strategy of driving growth in our higher margin offshore regions, accelerated by our new client wins and realizing cost savings through optimizing our site footprint will drive improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins for the second half of our fiscal year and in the years ahead. As a result of these factors, we are updating our full year guidance. On a full year basis, we expect revenues to be between $505 million and $510 million and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 12% to 13%. We feel strongly in our overall business fundamentals and the differentiated value proposition we bring our clients. We remain excited about our business and believe our recent client wins, strength of our pipeline and strategic investments will position us well as we move forward. With that, Bob and I will now take questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Koning from Baird.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hey guys, thanks for all the details. And maybe first of all the FinTech segment I was just looking at, it looked like it was down about 30% year-over-year. You talked a little bit about what happened there. That was really the entire decline of the total company is just that piece, really and the rest seemed to do quite a bit better. Maybe just go through a little more of what that was?\nBob Dechant: Sure, David, and thanks for joining and thanks for the question. So in the FinTech side we have had some crypto client as well as a kind of a new economy, millennial trading app partner client. And both of those, their businesses have been impacted really with kind of the economy, the crypto markets, et cetera, so those are down. On the other side of the equation I would look and say that a lot of the various verticals, there's winners, there's losers and so when we talked about where the softness came in, it wasn't really, aside from that FinTech's [indiscernible], there were winners, losers kind of across the various verticals. So we kind of like that as an overall macro that it's like, look one segment isn't – our biggest segments aren't really moving down. And so we have winners, losers around those some that are down, some of them that are deploying various call shedding solutions that are putting some pressure on various volumes.\nDavid Koning: Got you. Yes, No , that that makes sense. And then the utilization was actually quite good, like maybe one of the best you've ever had, but yet margins were a little weak. What's the dynamic there? I know it's going to get quite a bit better yet, but what's the dynamic there?\nBob Dechant: Yes, great question. And let me start out with, and Taylor, if you feel like adding feel free to do that. But the biggest starts with the deferred training impact in the quarter. So that took top line, but all the way down to the bottom line, $2.3 million. So that was if you look at then the margins on an EBITDA basis, certainly that had a large impact. What's interesting in what Taylor shared, if you normalize for that, our gross margins actually, they went up 100 basis points. And now that we kind of have that in our rear view mirror, some of those large ramps, that's why we feel like running where we are from the percentage of business in our offshore, our near-shore and running at the high utilizations. We feel really confident about the margin strengthening significantly in the second half.\nDavid Koning: Gotcha. That makes sense. And maybe just, if I – oh Taylor is going to jump in. Yes, sorry, go ahead.\nTaylor Greenwald: No, I was just going to just confirm that the underlying gross margins we feel very good about, they remain healthy. As Bob said, they were up roughly 100 basis points when you adjust for the deferred train revenue. And then as we look forward, we see some new wins in the higher margin regions, which are going to help propel our margins were going to. We have some specific site and region initiatives to drive the contribution margin in a couple of spots, and we're already starting to see those bear fruit. And then, as Bob mentioned we're going to continue to look at our footprint and we see some opportunities there as well. So we feel good about where our margins are and where they're going to head.\nDavid Koning: Yes that – now that's great. And if I can just sneak one more, can you explain one more time? I heard you say $1.7 million lower training revenue and then a $600,000 cost that added up to $2.3 million. Why did the training revenue go down so much year-over-year when it should just be kind of ratable recognition?\nTaylor Greenwald: Yes. So the way the accounting works when train revenue is built, it's built at the beginning of a program, but it's recognized over the life of the program. So if you look at last year versus this year, the way the amortization or the deferred revenue recognition schedules worked out, we recognized about $1.7 million of that revenue that has no cash associated with it, cash is all received up front. And then this year, because we won some new logos recently and actively ramping some new programs, we deferred an additional $600,000 versus the prior year. So you've got net those two together, and you can see the $2.3 million adverse impact to our financials. And I can also point you, if you look at our Q in footnote 2, at the end of footnote 2, there is a detailed schedule of our deferred revenue that helps provide some insight into that as well.\nDavid Koning: Awesome. Bob, thanks so much for all that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities.\nJack Wilson: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Jack Wilson on for Tobey. So I sort of just to follow-up on that margin question. Do we expect to see sort of any cadence for the margin through the remainder of the year? Do we expect that to sort of ramp up? Or is it going to be a little more varied?\nBob Dechant: No, I think I would expect to see some ramp up. We'll see some notable improvement in Q3. And if you look at our first half of the year, our margins, EBITDA margins came in around 11%. And we said for the year, we expect them to be 12% to 13%, which implies a margin in the back half of the year, but the back half to be between 13% and 15%. And I would expect that to ramp up a bit between those two quarters.\nJack Wilson: Okay, thanks for that. Then sort of a follow up on the utilization as well. So once the full shift to more offshore is complete, is that 91% utilization sort of sustainable, or is this sort of a, I don't know, part of that ramp or a high point?\nTaylor Greenwald: That's great question, Jack. And how I look at it is, especially with seasonality that we have, which is typically our Q2, that kind of flexes up into the 90s. That's a good metric for us. And so – but I would say that running in the 90 plus is not really that sustainable. Our goal is probably in the 85% range. That's a good range. So somewhere between 75% to 85% are the guardrails that we run at. And that – what we're excited about this year is as we have some of the seasonality ramps that kind of dissipate, this new logo engine is really picking up a lot of pace and the ramps that we are currently underway are filling up. And so we feel that that will – and the lion's share of that sitting in the, let's say, offshore and nearshore markets. So we think that that's going to continue to layer in those markets, strengthening utilizations in those, keeping it pretty high, which then we should be generating some pretty good gross margins in those regions in the back half.\nJack Wilson: Okay, that makes sense. And then just one last one for me. So when you're talking to clients about AI, is that something you're pitching to them and sort of using it as a differentiator, or is that something they're asking you about – sort of asking for?\nTaylor Greenwald: Oh, great. Boy, that's a fantastic question. And I would say that you have engagements that cover both as you described. Some clients are looking at us and saying, hey, what are you seeing out there in the marketplace? What have you solved, et cetera? And in that scenario, we'll come in and say, look, we've built this solution. We've built a smart IVR solution or a voice bot type solution. These things have impacted call volumes driven CSAT up. Things like that where we're proactively selling what we've already built and serviced. And those give us a lot of credibility in this space as BPOs really start moving. Other clients, though, are sitting and saying, hey, we're kind of trying to whiteboard here and engaging us more in a consultative approach where we're trying to figure out what the right strategy is for them and maybe not have kind of a can solution pack. So, they're spanning, I think, both areas. Most importantly, though, is clients are looking at BPO partners that are strong in both. And so you really have to win the day not just as a great BPO in a market like the Philippines, but you have to also be able to check the box and say, look, we have that ability, we have the development and the experience to develop an AI solution. And we're winning in that against, I'll tell you, the much bigger players. And so kind of leveraging our speed, our focus and just really the strength of us as a tech-led company. And so I really like our position as the clients are looking for both out of a BPO partner. And so, hence, we have a pipeline that's building that we feel pretty good about and getting a lot of traction inside our embedded base, too.\nJack Wilson: Thank you so much for that added color there. I'll turn it over.\nTaylor Greenwald: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Potter from Citi.\nRyan Potter: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start on the volume softness that you mentioned that you saw in the quarter, and you expect to continue in 3Q. I know you talked about the FinTech vertical and the impacts you're seeing there, but I guess what other factors would you attribute this softness in volumes to? Is it mostly coming from macro related factors, or is there some impact from technology factors, or are you showing up like AI impacts and stuff like that? Also, is the volume softness concentrated in any other verticals to call out beyond FinTech?\nBob Dechant: Sure. So probably the first place – and Ryan, thanks the question and also thanks for joining and all. The logistics part of our transportation vertical, the clients that we serve there, package delivery is down pretty sizably, and you can read across really all the logistics players, front page Wall Street Journal articles, et cetera. So that's an example where you would say a sub-segment might be impacted, but flipping it over to, let's say, in our world of retail and ecommerce, and we service several of the largest players in those areas, you have some strength that's going in there, and we're excited about that. The downturn, though, in those select clients for us is a little bit more than historical. And so when I look at those, I would attribute it mostly to their volumes aren't down. It's not really driven by kind of AI technologies just taking a swath of volume out of the equation. Now, what we are seeing, though, is in the world of clients looking at AI, they are identifying areas of their business and engaging us to help solve where AI can take volume out. And here is what I would say kind of the way we think about it is, in their world of digital transformation, trying to take a classic voice call and try to drive that to digital, self serve, kind of AI-assisted, or AI entirely soft. So those are out there, we are engaging with some clients to solve that. That will take some volume out of the equation, but more importantly, from an IBEX standpoint, is, I think, that plays into our strength. 80% of our business today is non-voice. As we've talked about, it's very heavy digital first. It plays into the strength of our Wave iX solutions. And so I think, in spite of that, we think our strategy and our wins will help offset some of that downturn. Now, our strategy, and we've seen these dimensions kind of occurring for several quarters, I think, it hit us last of all the BPOs, because most of my peers have been under a lot of pressure for a while. For us, it's been the last two quarters. Now we've been investing into our sales engine to try to outrun this, and I think we are building a business, and this is what I'm probably most excited about. I think that we're building a business in spite of these elements that we have the ability with how we're winning, how that pipeline is really heating up and we're taking on, and our win rates are through the roof. I feel like we can outrun that. And as we look at our business, I think, the inflection point for us is in Q4.\nRyan Potter: Got it. That all makes sense. And tagging on that last part of it was good to see the sales momentum continuing the quarter from what you did in 1Q and the early part of 2Q. Is there any additional color you can give on those new deals in the quarter and how quickly you think they can ramp? Do they have the potential to become top clients for you? And I guess, how much of this would you attribute to AI or having the capacity offshore to help win these deals?\nBob Dechant: Sure. So both of our largest wins that we're really, really excited about, that we went against the biggest of the biggest. Let me give you two dynamics. One was in our near shore region in Jamaica, which we're thinking confident that we're already expanding into Nicaragua with them. The other is in the Philippines, in the provincial play in our Philippines. So, a, we're winning across both theaters now. My team has done win reviews with both clients, and the win review had a very common theme. You guys were completely leaned in from me, the CEO, to my ELT team, and then to my entire kind of support function teams. That include our training heads, our workforce heads, and our heads of recruiting and development. That's how we run our business. That's how we win, is fully leaned in. I candidly believe that the reason starts with that, and many of our bigger players are maybe not quite focused on that part of their business as they're deep into integrations and synergies. Secondly, aside from that is they really look at the market and then who's the best in the market. And so that's why I highlight what I'm so encouraged about is winning in nearshore and winning in the Philippines against these, because it's a testimony to not just IBEX, but IBEX in the markets that we operate. We have a best-of-breed solution there, and that's showing. And then the last leg of that. So those are part of winning the day as a BPO. And then the last leg is when we engage and talk about AI solutions, we're not talking slideware. We're talking real solutions that we've been delivering that they look and say, wow, those are credible solutions. Those are the types of things we want. We're hearing from your competitors, slideware, and put those altogether, it puts us in a great position.\nRyan Potter: Got it. And if I could sneak one last one in. You mentioned Wave iX and I think you guys announced that a week or two ago, so it might be early, but any initial client feedback to the new offering capabilities. And how is this differentiated which versus what's already out there in the marketplace?\nBob Dechant: Sure. So we’ve – our Wave iX is really a packaging of really the solutions that we've been out selling and engaging for the last kind of nine months. But we’ve been – we kind of shared this as we are developing AI around the three access, access a around agents, access b around deep analytics and access c around the customer interaction. And we've been outselling that now with this, we've kind of put that all together under an architecture and just kind of have that and then the various solutions underneath that. Now, where we've come a long way is developing what I would say is the solutions and then the partner network, the AI kind of third-party partner network that we have under there, that we're bringing those solutions almost as an integrator. And those are – the clients are really liking the way that we're thinking about what those engagements and what those partners are, and they see them kind of as meaningful.\nRyan Potter: Great, thanks again.\nBob Dechant: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Bob Dechant, CEO, for closing remarks.\nBob Dechant: Great. Thank you, operator. Look, I think, appreciate everybody joining here. Really proud of what my team continues to do. This business is positioned really strongly for the second half and beyond. And I think this industry is at an inflection point, as I said. And I think we're in a great position to be a winner and a leader in the – kind of in this where the industry is moving to. So thanks all for your confidence and trust into IBEX. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

In the quarter, we delivered on our key objectives while achieving the high end of our revenue guidance and coming in line with our EBITDA margin guidance. More importantly, IBEX continues to consistently execute, capitalize on market opportunities and strengthen our position. Q1 FY 2024 is our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth and our fifth straight quarter of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin improvement, driven by continued growth of our high-margin services and geographies. Revenues for the quarter were $124.6 million as we continue to migrate portions of our onshore business to higher-margin offshore and nearshore regions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% year-on-year to $13.7 million, up 90 basis points to 11%, while adjusted net income improved to $7.6 million from $6.8 million in the quarter, and adjusted EPS increased to $0.40 from $0.36 prior year. We generated $6.6 million in free cash flow, more than triple from the prior year quarter, finishing the quarter with an outstanding balance sheet that is debt-free and with a net cash position of $61.1 million. Our conversion rate of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow was nearly 50%. We believe that our consistent trajectory of margin improvement and maintaining an outstanding balance sheet and our ability to generate strong free cash flow puts us in an enviable competitive position. From an overall client and sales standpoint, our pipeline is resuming its pace of wins and deal flow. Our growth has been fueled historically by our powerful new logo engine, and fiscal 2024 is off to a fast start. We began the first quarter with four impressive new client wins across key verticals, including health care and financial services, and that carried into Q2. I’m excited to report that we have won two blue-chip Fortune 100 brands, one in the automotive transportation vertical and one with a very large retail brand in highly competitive deals. Both are launching in late Q2. Our competitive advantage continues to be centered around our BPO 2.0 capabilities. And now more recently, in our ability to bring advanced AI-based technology to our solution. Of these two wins, one is in our nearshore Jamaica region and the other in our provincial Philippines geography, demonstrating our ability to win in all the diverse markets we serve. We expect these two clients to scale in the second half of FY 2024. Additionally, IBEX continues to expand its higher-margin integrated omnichannel and digital first support, which is now 77% of our overall business, up from 71% a year ago. With these new wins and our strong pipeline, we remain confident in our brand and our ability to win transformative new business throughout the fiscal year. Operationally, we continue to execute well for our clients across all geographies and consistently outperform our competition. Our ability to not only land new clients but to expand with them is a strong proof point of our ability to operationally deliver. As a data point, today, for our top 25 clients, we operate on average in nearly 2.5 distinct geographies for them. We typically start with a client in one geography and then we grow with them in new regions based on our strong performance. We view this as a proxy for being a trusted partner to our clients and our ability to deliver exceptional customer experiences in all our operating regions. Now last quarter, I discussed our three access strategy for deploying AI for our clients to improve performance and the customer experience. The first access is focused on the frontline agent where we have been deploying generative AI to make the agent more productive as part of our Wave X tool set. Second is where we use AI in our deep analytics and business intelligence offering, enabling us to provide better, more actionable insights into the customer. And third is where we deploy generative AI to automate contacts with solutions such as voicebots and chatbots. This third prong is a further evolution of our digital transformation where we have been working with our clients moving from voice calls to digital contacts such as chat and SMS. We are now building solutions where the digital-first experience can start with digital automation, which we see as an even higher-margin service. This is why we are bullish on generative AI, and we see this as more opportunity than risk. I want to highlight that we are using our speed and our tech strength to quickly move into these opportunities. We now have over 15 opportunities in our pipeline with both existing and new clients. And these solutions are helping us win new clients. As an example, one of the key differentiators in our recent automotive transportation client win I referenced earlier was our unique ability to demonstrate and deliver an AI-powered smart IVR solution to digitally transform their customer experience. We leveraged our new Genesis platform and generative AI to build a solution that also includes conversational voice and chatbots, creating a seamless CX solution from an AI agent to a live agent. We see this as the next generation of integrated omnichannel and the next wave of Wave X. We believe solutions like this will continue the growth of our higher-margin digital first services. From a capital allocation standpoint, we are successfully executing on our share buyback program given the current valuation and the confidence in the trajectory of IBEX. Since we announced the program, we have acquired more than 400,000 shares back. We see this as a very attractive use of our growing capital. Additionally, we are actively exploring new markets for client expansion. Our strong balance sheet puts us in a great position to expand our geographical footprint and analyze market by market whether to organically expand or to look for a small tuck-in acquisition. And finally, our debt-free environment and our overall structure is enabling us to generate strong free cash flow, enabling us to put our capital to constructive use and to make targeted investments for growth. In closing, my team and I are focused on continued strengthening of the business and driving value for our employees, clients and our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Taylor to go through our financial results and guidance. Taylor?\nTaylor Greenwald: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. In my discussions of our first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results, references to revenue, net income and net cash generated from operations are on a U.S. GAAP basis, while adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of our U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the tables attached to our earnings press release. We had a strong quarter, representing a solid start to our fiscal year in terms of profitability and free cash flow as our clients continued migrating to lower-cost offshore regions and we absorbed the impact of a changing business environment for several of our FinTech clients, revenue declined 2.5% to $124.6 million compared to $127.8 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue mix continues to trend towards higher margin services and geographies, digital and omnichannel delivery now represents 77% of our total revenue, versus 71% in the first quarter a year ago, while our offshore and nearshore revenues now comprise 75% of total revenue versus 70% in the prior year quarter. Looking at revenue in total, the shift in geo mix and decline in the FinTech vertical were largely offset by growth in our strategic HealthTech and retail verticals. Net income increased to $7.4 million versus $6.5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was primarily driven by stronger operating results and higher interest income versus interest expense in the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher tax expense. EPS increased to $0.39 compared to $0.35 in the prior year quarter. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the year on a normalized basis. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income increased to $7.6 million compared to $6.8 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP fully diluted adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.40 compared to $0.36 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $13.7 million or 11% of revenue compared to $12.9 million or 10.1% of revenue for the same period last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by stronger operating results from an increased mix of higher-margin offshore and nearshore delivery, higher capacity utilization and an increased mix of digital and omnichannel delivery. Partially offsetting these operational benefits were higher SG&A expenses for investments in sales, marketing, IT, infrastructure and increased compliance expenses to support our growing business. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, our top five and top 10 client concentrations remained largely flat at 40% and 59%, respectively, of overall revenue. Our client base remains stable as yet one new client entered our top 10 client list. We have worked hard to diversify our client base over the last several years and are proud of the progress we have made. Switching to our verticals. Retail and e-commerce increased to 23.4% of first quarter revenue versus 21.3% in the prior year quarter. HealthTech increased to 11.9% of first quarter revenue versus 10.2% in the prior year quarter; and travel, transportation and logistics increased to 13.5% of first quarter revenue versus 13% in the prior year quarter. Conversely, our exposure to telecommunications vertical decreased to 16.8% of quarterly revenue versus 17.3% in the prior year quarter. Additionally, FinTech decreased to 14.8% of revenue for the quarter versus 19.9% in the prior year quarter, impacted by the changing landscape for crypto and new economy investment platform plants [ph]. Net cash generated from operations increased to $8.7 million for the quarter compared to $5.6 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to stronger operating results. Our DSOs were 67 days, up four days sequentially. Several larger client payments were received shortly after the quarter ended and negatively impacted our DSOs at the end of the first quarter. Despite this, we continue to be below industry average. Capital expenditures were $2.1 million or 1.6% of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 versus $3.6 million or 2.8% of revenue in the prior year quarter, and we continue to utilize our available capacity following the bills completed during the pandemic. The investment we did make in CapEx in the quarter was used predominantly for seat utilization of previously built out capacity. Free cash flow increased to $6.6 million in the current quarter compared to $2.0 million in the prior year quarter as we converted nearly half of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow. This is the highest level of free cash flow IBEX has generated in the first quarter of our fiscal year. We ended the first quarter with $62 million in cash, up from $57.4 million as of June 2023, mostly driven by strong cash conversion of operating profits during the quarter. Net cash improved to $61.1 million from $56.4 million as of June 2023. The borrowing availability under our revolving credit facilities increased to $72.6 million at September 2023 compared to $71.9 million as of June 2022. During the quarter on September 18, we announced a share repurchase program authorizing up to repurchase up to $30 million worth of shares. In the first quarter, we purchased – we repurchased 134,000 shares for $2 million for fiscal year-to-date through November 8, we have repurchased over 400,000 shares. Looking forward to the remainder of 2024, we're confident in the resiliency of our business, supported by the client diversification and strategic vertical expansions we built over the preceding years. As a result of our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our execution, which is reinforced by our reiteration of prior guidance and our share repurchase program. We believe our recent client wins and strength of our pipeline will return us to growth later in the year and position us well as we head into fiscal year 2025. I joined IBEX as I was excited about the diversity of clients convertible markets we serve, the strong balance sheet and positive cash flow, strength of our management team and employees and our ability to win market share to grow our business. As I have now been here for almost three months, I can say that I have not been disappointed in any of the assumptions I made about IBEX prior to joining the team. I'm certainly excited about our future and where we're headed. With that, Bob, I'll now take questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of Truist. Your line is open.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. I was wondering if you could describe what you're hearing from customers and your conversations with them about calendar 2024 growth expectations in their businesses and the implications for IBEX next year?\nBob Dechant: Yes. Thanks for the question, Tobey, and appreciate you joining the call. Our clients give us pretty good visibility to their business and their forecasts six months out, they'll kind of give directional views past that. If you look at the whole of them, they're still trying to figure that out. And you'll have some that are winning and they're pretty bullish on that and others that are kind of let's say, a little bit more conservative. You put it all together, it’s kind of looks like our top 25 clients that we've talked about, we talked about earlier that you don't sum up, some down. But for the most part, they're holding in really strong. And I think that's attributed to the very diversified business that we built not only from clients but from the verticals. And so some winners and some losers, we put it all together, and I think we're holding pretty strong.\nTobey Sommer: Appreciate that. And I was wondering maybe if you could describe the pace of deal flow, which in your – first part of your prepared remarks, I think you described it as improving. And maybe add to that a little bit of perspective on the contours of the pipeline of – for new logos. Thanks.\nBob Dechant: Sure. Yes. And that's an important part, as you know, of our business. And last quarter, I kind of shared that, hey, the pace is picking up, and we had some really large shields that are in play. And really delighted to announce that we're two for two on those very large deals, and we won four other deals. And that's really the track record that my team and I have built here over years. The first two quarters of the calendar year, our last two quarters of our fiscal year, they started slowing and they started getting delayed and deals. And I see that things are back to the pace that they were and with very large blue-chip deals and also what I think are some really new economy kind of disruptive brands. And so we're getting excited about where this business is picking up again and how that trajectory looks in the back – not only in the back half of the year, in total [ph], but really into 2025.\nTobey Sommer: And then I just wanted to ask capital – a question about capital deployment and I'll get back in the queue. Should we expect a similar pace of acquisition – or excuse me, share repurchase given the announced value that you said you execute over six months. And maybe if you could give us the parameters in thought process around how you're going to manage the balance sheet sort of over time once that's coming on and been executed on, how low would you let cash go? Do you want cash to remain relatively stable even in, with the share repurchase? Thanks.\nBob Dechant: Yes. Taylor, why don't you?\nTaylor Greenwald: Yes. No, absolutely. So, Tobey, we don't provide a forecast or guidance for our share repurchase. But what I can say is, we certainly believe the valuations that our shares are trading right now are compelling. And as you saw, once we announced the share repurchase program, we've repurchased over 400,000 shares for $6.7 million, and we have authorization up to $30 million. So we have over an additional $20 million availability to continue the repurchase program. But fortunately, if you look at our balance sheet, as you indicated, we have no debt. We have a very nice cash balance, we have positive cash flow. And so we balance all our capital allocation strategies. At this point, we don't have any debt to repay, aren't considering a dividend. So it's really our capital is going to be balanced between share repurchase expanding capacity in targeted geographies. And then we're also, as Bob mentioned, open to targeted and opportunistic M&A opportunities if they come along. So I would say that we are comfortable at our balance sheet, obviously, where it is now, but we'd also be comfortable deploying some of the capital on these items, assuming we get the proper returns. So we'll continue down that path but feel we're in very good shape from a balance sheet perspective.\nTobey Sommer: If I could sneak in a follow-up there. With respect to targeted acquisitions, could you describe in the broadest parameters, like what kind of thing would fit? Is it geographic? Is it an industry? Is it some existing customer relationships? What would you want to extract from an acquisition like that?\nTaylor Greenwald: Exactly. I think we'd be interested potentially in geographic expansion, in geographies where we aren't currently located to get a beachhead and then we can grow organically from there. I think also, we have strategic verticals. And if we saw an opportunity that was focused on one of our strategic verticals, I think that would interest us as well.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you.\nBob Dechant: Yes. And Tobey, if I could just add. We are – for the better part of my first seven, eight years here, we were heads down operating this business. And now that we've really transformed this business and we have this really well-structured balance sheet and business model. We've now really created a Corp Dev team that has a lot of pipeline that we are evaluating in that. And so going back a year; we're kind of just starting that process. And now we've been careful about it, but there's a lot of opportunities that we're having. And the good news is, I think we have the team that is pretty sharp and savvy and looking at the right things and then we'll make – if that comes across, we'll make that decision.\nTobey Sommer: Appreciate your responses. Thank you.\nBob Dechant: Operator, are there any more questions?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Koning: Yes. Hey guys nice job, and can you hear me?\nBob Dechant: Sure can Dave. Yes.\nDave Koning: All right. Good. Good. So I guess my first question, you're doing a nice job. This year is a little tougher growth-wise, but would you be growing better? Maybe how much headwind is the shift offshore? And how much is it in a normal year? Like is this year a 5% headwind from the shift offshore, but in a normal year might only be a couple of percent. Like how much of the headwind to revenue is this? I know that's good for margin, but just kind of talk through that?\nBob Dechant: Sure. And I guess the way to think about this, Dave, and I think we talked about in the numbers is the percentage of business that we now have in the near-shore and offshore regions. And that increased 5% for our business, and so – and if you look at what's happened in the U.S., which is where that is extensively coming from, that's down sizably. So you can see the correlation of the U.S. down to the movements in other regions. And so I think that's the math that's there. We're – what I like is, I think we've got a lot of that, that transformation or the move kind of behind us as we move kind of into the second half of this year. And so I think the way I look at it is, hopefully, that will be key in us resuming – kind of getting into resuming out what has been our really strong growth track record of the better part of eight years. And so I think once those things kind of level normalized, I think that will be a key driver for us and especially because that pipeline is picking up.\nTaylor Greenwald: And Bob, I'll just add in terms of the migration, it certainly has contributed. We've had very nice gross margin improvement over the past year. It's gone from about 25% in the first quarter of 2023 to 29% this quarter. And the shift to offshore has certainly helps us improve that gross margin as well as operate improvements we've made in the U.S.\nDave Koning: Got you. Tanks for that and then maybe just as a follow-up question. You've had a lot of years where you've grown very well, right around 10% or so. In a normal year like that, how much of the growth is from existing and how much is from new? And then in a year like this, how does that change? And then do you think you'll get back to normal by next year, maybe even late this year?\nBob Dechant: Yes. We're hoping that we can get – and again, the market is a little bit tough, Dave, right? So in all, so can we get to double-digit in the back half of the year in Q4 or into 2025? I'm not quite sure we're there yet. But can we get into upper single-digits, that's what we're hopeful for. In fact, if things keep progressing on the pipeline, we feel good about just how that trajectory adds up. And if you look at, Dave, I kind of look and say, and we've shared these numbers in past, our new logo revenue has ranged in the $30 million to $50 million in your revenue over the last, let's say, kind of three, four years-ish. And so as we kind of move from a $400 million to $500 million company, you can just kind of do that math, $30 million, $40 million, $50 million, of the $400 million, $500 million also that adds in, in year, [ph] about 10% growth. But more importantly, as you know, those clients do have historically done 2.5 times in a year or two. So that usually – you put those two things together, and that has given strong growth for us. And we think we're in a good position to have our business structurally look like that down the road.\nDave Koning: Got you. That's helpful. Great job on margins and cash flow, too.\nBob Dechant: Yes, we're excited about what we've done here structurally as a company that just – it's really – we're proud of that.\nDave Koning: Yes. Great to see. Thanks guys.\nBob Dechant: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Roswell of RBC. Your line is open.\nMatthew Roswell: Yes. Congratulations on a nice quarter. I have three questions; sorry about that, all revolving around the large wins. And I guess the three of them are first, you mentioned that they were very competitive. So can you talk about pricing and competition for those wins for the large wins and then in general? Second part of the question is the analytics piece, is that – do you think that will become stable stakes to winning new deals relatively soon? And the final question for Taylor is, you had mentioned the ramp towards the back half of the year. How should we think about sort of the seasonality of the revenues, are they large enough to kind of move the needle? Thank you.\nBob Dechant: Great. So let me take the – Matt, thank you and thanks for those questions and joining. Let me take the first two, and then Taylor will bounce over to you, if that makes sense. But – so the deals that I talked about, especially the large deals are very, very competitive. And again, I would just sit and say, think of the big multibillion dollar players, the $10 billion multiplayers toe-to-toe in those. And so I like to call those on Broadway deals. And what both of them – one common thing that we had in both of those and one was a near-shore deal and one was a provincial Philippine deal was the decision and your position around – and your ability to deliver generative AI solutions in this one case, as I highlighted, the smart IVR that then has chatbots and voicebots in the front end of the experience and being able to deliver those; that was key. And if we bring it out light on that versus the other folks, there's no way we would have won that. And if I go back a year ago, that would never been in anybody's decision-making process. So its front and center and the other deal, and we're implementing that immediately. The other deal was very similar, but it's kind of like Page 2 [ph] for them. And so what I love is in that area of the business, we're going, head up against a multibillion dollar players [indiscernible]. And we're beating them because we have the BPO 2.0 capabilities, the culture, the analytics, the branding, all of that, the Wave X Technology and now AI, and we're not taking a backseat, and that's why I love about what we've done. And therefore, the pricing is – it's not front and center. You have to be competitive. We think that with – and again, think of this, these experiences now become [indiscernible] experiences. They are lower cost than [indiscernible] experiences, but it's just an extension. The way I look at this, it's just an extension of the transactions that we do with human folks, but now we get paid and – but we're using technology to do that and you monetize it. And we think that, that is the visual, or I have is that is higher margin. So when you put all of that together, that's why we're bullish on this. And I know the market looks at AI as around BPO as a risk. But that solution is clearly an extension of what we do, and that's why we're excited about that. And that's why pricing is competitive. It's – you don't have – you're not winning on low pricing, let me put it that way, you just – we hold around. On the end your Part 2, I apologize for that long winded answer, Matt, but that was something that we're excited about. On the analytics side, that's stable stakes. But the question is, how good are you? So you have to have the analytics, but where we think we're differentiating those difference is using AI through analytics, where you can, a, not be so reliant on humans, so you can scale it more cost effectively, but instead of surveying a low percentage of calls, you can survey 100% of the calls and then use those analytics, those AI analytics to find better insights acne [ph] insights. And we think that we are the stable stakes, but within that there’s going to be those that can build it as a strong competitive advantage, and I think we're in a great position on that. And Taylor will view on Part 3.\nTaylor Greenwald: Yes. So like Part 3 related to the progression of the year and how we see some of the new wins rolling out. So if we look at revenue from Q1 to Q2, we are going to have a similar seasonal rent as we did last year, maybe just not quite as strong, but I think it will be very similar to last year. And so revenue from a Q2 perspective will be down slightly on a year-over-year basis. But with the wins, the four wins that Bob mentioned we won Q1 and then we have two additional so far in Q2, we're going to see revenue ramping so that Q3 will probably be an inflection point on a year-over-year basis in terms of revenue growth, and then we see the contributing nicely to Q4, and we will return to growth in Q4. From a profitability standpoint, profitability often following revenue. So on a year-over-year basis, the profitability will be down slightly as rev will be down slightly in Q2. But we're also ambitious with all these deals that we've won and ramping, we – as you know, we expense our training costs as they're incurred and we defer the trading revenue. So it has a negative drag on margins initially. So we'll see some of that impact in Q2. But as these deals ramped and revenue grows and some of the training costs behind us, you'll see a nice progress in margins in Q3 and Q4. And we always see a nice trend between Q2 and Q3 anyway just because of some of the seasonal training, which just falls off between Q2 and Q3, and we'll see that again this year as well.\nMatthew Roswell: Okay. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Potter of Citi. Your line is open. \nRyan Potter: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just to see the two deals that you mentioned in 2Q and with some of it coming from your Gen AI capabilities. But could you give an update on where you stand with your planned investments and rollouts of into Gen AI and various capabilities around that? And I guess what has client adoption been so far of Gen AI are we still in very early stages? Are most clients starting to ask for some Gen AI embedded into your current services? And tagging on that cadence question, how do you expect AI to kind of help you through the peak volumes even in 2Q.\nBob Dechant: Sure. Really good question, Ryan, and I appreciate that. So Gen AIs, it's early, yes, very, very early. And so we have pretty much over the last quarter, and I believe I have this in my remarks that we now have 15 opportunities sitting in that pipeline. Some of those are embedded base clients. Others are kind of like this new win that we had that you're asking us to deliver around that. But there's not one – there's not one only solution, might, it's not like everything is voice bots or everything is chatbots as it relates to AI. Our clients are looking at us to kind of multiple facets around how to deploy AI to improve, either take cost out or improve the experience and improve the number of interactions that we can do. And so we're early on those and there's different types. And so as it relates to kind of the impact it's having, here's what I do know. Gen AI is not really taking any volumes out of any of our clients' business, but it has the potential to complement. It has the potential to move the actual human interactions to very complex and take the lower cost ones of. And if we can do that and we can use technology and create a high-margin business on that, it creates, I think, a powerful business model for IBEX. And so that's kind of how we're thinking around this. As it relates to – is any of this really changing the ability to maybe not ramp so much during peak season. My team and I have actually been out in front with quite a few clients where we have kind of building call deflection solutions for them where they don't have to hire that many folks, and we do that. Now I think those will take hold probably for next year. I think they got a lot of interest on those for this peak season and probably didn't have the time to get there. And my belief is as we turn the corner here next year around; you're going to see maybe some of those solutions being implemented and some pretty good technology scale solutions that will be delivering.\nRyan Potter: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess on the excess seat capacity you guys have kind of called out. Can you comment on how much of that seat capacity is kind of left to sell into? And are there certain geos where you have more capacity than others? And I guess, in terms of CapEx, CapEx has been relatively low as you've been selling into seats already built, but can you comment on eventual additional buildup you might need and how CapEx might trend going forward and then how you decide on the organic versus inorganic growth?\nBob Dechant: Sure. Taylor, let me take the first part and then maybe you can kind of talk around the CapEx. Let me talk a little bit about the utilization around the geographies and such. And we – and I think you can see these in the growth rates of our regions that you'll see. But our offshore regions have been growing pretty aggressively. So we've been building a lot of capacity in those regions. And then our nearshore regions have been going not quite as fast, a fast rate. So if I look at it right now, we have plenty of capacity in the nearshore. That's why I'm excited about the one win that we have large client in Jamaica, because I don't think the big chunk out of that, and that's – should have strong margin flow through to margins. With the growth that we've been doing in the Philippines, we'll probably continue to look at some new markets, some new provincial plays in a market like that. And so I think we can get into some balanced CapEx going, going forward. I think we've been very conservative, Taylor, I love your thoughts on that.\nTaylor Greenwald: Yes. No, I think you're spot on. I think that there's one geography that we probably would lean into a little bit more than others where utilization is right now is probably the Philippines. If you look at our capital expenditures in the first quarter, they were just a little over $2 million, which is around the – it's on the lower side of our capital expenditures. We provided guidance of $15 million to $20 million for the year, which would imply that we would accelerate some of those capital expenditure investments and capacity expansions later in the year is when I would expect that to happen.\nRyan Potter: Got it. Thanks again. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'm showing no questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob Dechant, CEO for any closing remarks.\nBob Dechant: Yes. Thanks, Valerie [ph]. Thank you all for listening to our earnings call. In closing, I just have to say this; we're really proud of what we've built here and have full confidence in where this business is going and our ability to deliver in the future. So, thank you all for listening, and we'll look forward to the next quarter. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.
