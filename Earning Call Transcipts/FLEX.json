Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Rubin. You may begin.\nDavid Rubin: Thank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and welcome to Flex's third quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Revathi Advaithi; and our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Lundstrom. Both will give brief remarks followed by a Q&A. Slides for today's call as well as a copy of the earnings press release and summary financials are available on the Investor Relations section at flex.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our corporate website. As a reminder, today's call contains forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and assumptions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary statements in our presentation, press release, or in the Risk Factors section in our most recent filings with the SEC. Note, this information is subject to change and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please note, unless otherwise stated, our results provided will be non-GAAP measures and all growth metrics will be on a year-over-year basis. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations can be found in the appendix slides of today's presentation as well as in the summary financials posted on the Investor Relations website. As previously announced on January 2nd, 2024, Flex completed the spin-off of all of its remaining interest in Nextracker to Flex shareholders. As a result of the completion of the spin-off, Nextracker became a fully independent public company. Flex no longer directly or indirectly holds any shares of Nextracker common stock and Flex will no longer consolidate Nextracker into its financial results. Please note, our guidance for fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 excludes any economic interest in Nextracker, and for fiscal year 2024, full-year guidance includes Flex economic interest in Nextracker for Q1 through Q3. However, it also excludes it from Q4 fiscal 2024. Lastly, the historical results of Nextracker and certain assets and liabilities included in the spin-off will be reported in Flex's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations beginning in Flex's fourth quarter ending in March 31st, 2024. With all that, now I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Revathi.\nRevathi Advaithi: [Technical Difficulty] the tax-free spin that occurred in early January, making Nextracker a fully independent company. We wish them great success in the future and look forward to watching their continued growth. Through this process, we unlock tremendous value and the approach reflects in our continued focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Of course, Flex remains committed to enabling the transition to renewable energy in our core business. We serve a wide variety of customers and applications, generating over $1 billion in revenue for this market. I should also mention that we continue to expand the use of renewable energy in our own factories as part of our net zero journey. Now moving to our results on Slide 4. Overall fiscal Q3 was another quarter of strong execution. For total Flex, revenue was $7.1 billion. Adjusted operating margin came in at 6.7%, and we delivered $0.71 of adjusted EPS. Looking at results for Core Flex, which exclude Nextracker, we continue to execute very well with this dynamic environment. Revenue was $6.4 billion. Core Flex operating margin came in at a record 4.9%, up both sequentially and year-over-year, and we delivered $0.54 of EPS. Again this was solid execution in the quarter. Now, the takeaway should be clear. Our results continue to show the resiliency of the Flex model and fundamental changes to the industry. Despite significant macro-driven volume fluctuations, we have continued to deliver on our margin and EPS commitments. We remain very well positioned across the markets we serve, and this comes from our deep relationships with our customers and our ability to provide world-class quality and value in the products we manufacture. I want to share a couple of highlights from the quarter that demonstrate our strong market position. AI is driving changes in data movement, both through the data center and across the network. Our strength in hyperscale data center and networking infrastructure are key enablers of our customer success in delivering these products at scale. We've talked before about our strong positioning with multiple hyperscale customers. We're the only EMS provider with a comprehensive offering including bespoke fully-integrated rack systems and power solutions ranging from embedded, discrete and all the way up to data center critical power. In addition, we offer value-added services in design, metal, components, supply chain management integration, and aftermarket services, including circular economy. As a result of our comprehensive offerings, we continue to see very strong growth in our cloud business. On the networking side, a good example is our partnership with Cisco. Recently, we were honored to receive their 2023 Electronic Manufacturing Services Partner of the Year Award. We're also building on our 20-year partnership with Ciena, another world-class networking company to provide US-based manufacturing capabilities and supply chain services, enabling Ciena to ramp high volume production of its innovative pluggable optical technologies in support of the BEAD, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment programs, and the Build America Buy America requirements. Now looking at automotive. Next-gen mobility, including EV onboard electronics, charging infrastructure, advanced compute systems for the software-defined vehicle remain very important long-term growth drivers. And Flex plays a key role across these ecosystems to support the OEMs, including designing our co-designing content, while bringing world-class manufacturing and supply chain leadership. We have built a well-diversified portfolio of solutions for ICE, hybrid, full EV, and across the spectrum of driver assistance and safety. For example, our advanced compute platform technology that powers software-defined vehicles is agnostic across ICE, hybrid and EVs. We also have established relationships with many of the upstream semiconductor providers as evidenced by our previously announced partnership with Nvidia for ADAS and autonomous applications, and we recently showcased our next-gen EV power electronics full design capability with STMicroelectronics, utilizing the latest in silicon carbide MOSFET technology. So you can see, Flex is well-positioned for every stage of this long-term technology transition. It is also very important to remember as a platform we are experts in complex computing power, which gives us a competitive advantage across the multiple markets. Our technology and vertical integration capabilities serve many applications, including hyperscale data centers, renewables and next-generation mobility. Our customers look to us to help them navigate the complexity and implement these integrated capabilities to give them a competitive advantage. Now the current environment remains highly dynamic and we're already seeing the impact from elevated interest rates in some markets and excess inventory in others. We have made it through the supply chain crisis. However, we carefully watch the situation in the Red Sea and how that could impact supply lines. We continue to execute through the cycle and we are very well-positioned in markets with strong long-term secular drivers. The greater stability in margins and EPS validates the change we made to our business and the evolution of the top-tier EMS industry. We are very optimistic about our future. With that, I'll pass the call over to Paul to take you through our financials. Paul?\nPaul Lundstrom: Okay. Thank you, Revathi. I would also like to start by wishing Nextracker great success on the new path and reiterate something that Revathi said. This separation is a great example of our commitment to create strong shareholder value. As you may recall, we executed on multiple value-creating transactions over this whole process with the private equity investment, the IPO, the follow-on, and finally the investor-friendly and tax-efficient spin of the remaining Nextracker shares. Jumping to our third quarter performance on Slide 7. It was another solid quarter. Third quarter revenue was $7.1 billion. Gross profit improved to $712 million and gross margin increased 10%, an increase of over 200 basis points. Operating income was $477 million with operating margin at 6.7%, up from 4.8% in the prior year period. And earnings per share came in at $0.71 for the quarter, increasing 15%, which includes $0.10 of Nextracker non-controlling interest. Looking at Core Flex results, which excludes Nextracker, results were stronger than initially expected with Core Flex revenue down -- excuse me Core Flex revenue up $6.4 billion, down 11%, but against a tough year-over-year compare. Core Flex operating margin came in at a record 4.9%, up 60 basis points with another quarter of sequential margin expansion, up 20 basis points from Q2. This is reflective of our strong execution, including cost actions and continued mix improvements. The Flex Core business delivered $0.54 of EPS, up 10%. Turning to our quarterly segment results on the next slide. Reliability revenue was $3 billion with solid demand in auto and medical devices, while we saw further macro-driven weakness in commercial industrial solutions and continued headwinds in residential solar. Operating income came in at $159 million and operating margin for this segment improved sequentially and year-over-year to 5.4%. In Agility, revenue came in at $3.5 billion as we executed on very strong AI-driven cloud demand. Operating income came in at $174 million. The team delivered a record 5% operating margin, reflective of favorable mix, continuing value-added services adoption and strong operational cost management. Finally, Nextracker delivered revenue of $710 million, up 38%. Operating income at Nextracker was $162 million, delivering 23% operating margin. Moving to cash flow on Slide 9. We made further progress on our inventory improvement goals, reducing net inventory again by 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. In general, the semiconductor shortages that punctuated the previous supply chain challenges are largely back to normal, and we expect continued reductions in inventory and working capital advances. However, the Red Sea situation could temporarily impact the pace of those reductions if supply chains are adversely affected by increasing transit times. Q3 net CapEx came in at $128 million, on target at 2% of revenue. We expect to maintain a similar total investment level in Q4. Free cash flow in the quarter was $156 million. We expect free cash flow in Q4 to be between $300 million and $400 million for Core Flex. So given where we are today, that would put us in line with our original FY 2024 free cash flow guidance of $600 million that had assumed a combined Flex and Nextracker for the full year, despite the absence of Nextracker in Q4. In the quarter, we returned $275 million to shareholders through share repurchases ahead of the full Nextracker separation. Fiscal year-to-date, we have returned approximately $780 million. Please turn to the next slide for our segment outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. For Reliability Solutions, we expect the revenue will be down mid-single-digit to low-teens. As we expect continued strength in cloud power solutions, stable demand in automotive and medical devices, and continued mixed demand in medical equipment and life sciences. We also expect further macro-related weakness in core industrial and also residential solar. Revenue in Agility is expected to be down low-teens to low-20s percent. We continue to see strong AI-driven cloud spending with weakness in communications, enterprise, IT and consumer-related end-markets. Q4 is also typically our seasonally weakest quarter across Agility. On to Slide 11 for our quarterly guidance. With the Nextracker separation completed on January 2nd, Q4 guidance is now based only on Core Flex financials and is not comparable to previous consensus. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.4 billion with operating income between $305 million and $355 million. Interest and other is estimated to be around $53 million. We expect the tax rate to be around 15% in the quarter. All of that translates to adjusted EPS between $0.50 and $0.60 based on approximately $425 million weighted-average shares outstanding. And looking at our GAAP guidance, recall for Q3, we expected approximately $100 million in restructuring charges. We implemented about $70 million of that in Q3 so we expect at least another $30 million of those charges will then shift into Q4. Looking at our full-year guidance on the following slide. Note that FY 2024 total Flex guidance still includes the impact from Nextracker in the prior three quarters. Please note, total Flex full-year guidance is not comparable to our previous guidance or consensus due to the January separation of Nextracker. So for total Flex, we expect full-year revenue between $27.7 billion and $28.3 billion, adjusted operating margin now between 5.7% and 5.9%, and adjusted EPS between $2.47 and $2.57 a share. As with last quarter, for additional visibility, we are providing our expectations for Core Flex only for the full year and this guidance is comparable to Core Flex guidance that we gave last quarter. So for Core Flex, our guidance is essentially unchanged from last quarter. We expect full-year revenue between $26 billion and $26.6 billion. We expect adjusted operating margin to be between 4.8% and 4.9%, and we expect adjusted EPS of between $2.07 and $2.17 a share. As we enter into the final quarter of the year, our team continues to execute very well in a challenging environment. As Revathi pointed out, the results we are delivering validate that Flex is a more resilient and efficient company. Strong long-term trends remain intact, and we continue to have ample opportunity to build on our diversified portfolio and customer base through new wins and increasing wallet share, and we'll continue to drive margin expansion and ultimately create shareholder value. Lastly, this year we will hold our virtual investor event in conjunction with our fiscal Q4 earnings call where we will provide full fiscal 2025 guidance and also update our longer-term outlook. So please stay tuned for that. I'll now turn the call back over to you, Diego, to start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [MP] (ph) on for Samik Chatterjee. I wanted to ask regarding like with the updated visibility regarding end markets. Can you please revisit the $2.65 Core Flex EPS target for FY 2025, and let us know both drivers regarding the same versus -- with respect to top line expansion versus operating margins and buyback support? And I have one follow-up.\nRevathi Advaithi: Okay. So I'll start off and Paul jump in here wherever he want to. I'll first start by saying is that our fiscal year ends in March, and as Paul pointed out, we'll be doing our Investor Day in April. So that's kind of when we'll be really talking about guidance for fiscal 2025 and long-term. But the first is I'll just start by saying if I go back to 2022 long-term targets that we set, we talked about a few things, right? We talked about 5% Core Flex operating margin. We talked about mid-teens EPS growth. And we still think those targets are in the right ballpark. I'll just say that the market is very dynamic. You know that as well as we do so we'll have to wait a little bit like I said in the beginning for next quarter to give the exact number when we give the full FY 2025 guidance. But I want to take a minute and just take a step back and look at what we've done right in the last four years to complete the transformation that we started. So that includes major portfolio alignment, operational transitions and a lot of shareholder-friendly corporate development actions. This quarter, we hit Core Flex operating margin of 4.9%, which was a record and we expect that to improve again next quarter. So, clearly delivering on the commitment. We have a more agile and a more efficient company that's focused on higher-value business. But the goal of all this transformation was also to make Flex a more investable company so we also focus on the quality of earnings and that means that if you look at the primary drivers of our fundamentals, it's about strong growth in end-markets with long-term trends, increasing that wallet share with our customers, so it's good growth, right? And then on top of that, we're adding things like value-added services and executing well operationally. So going back to the things we said, good margin expansion in 2022, we said this EPS growth in the mid-teens. Despite all the macro and the corporate development work we have done with [indiscernible] and Nextracker, we have done good work on capital return. So I would say we remain a strong agile resilient company, a lot of macro uncertainties, and we'll use the next few months to figure it out. But we feel good about the fundamentals of what we talked about in 2022. Paul anything you'd add?\nPaul Lundstrom: Yeah. I think you said it well. I mean, we told you that we think we can do margins of 5%, down the road, and like you said, we just hit 4.9% and expect to do more. We also have talked about mid-teens EPS growth. As I look ahead to next year, I think that's reasonable, low-teens, mid-teens, and we're buying back stock. So I think the hard part for us at the moment is what's revenue growth really going to be based on the macro. We're listening to all the same earnings calls that all of you guys are too and I can kind of go down the list for FY -- calendar 2024. We look at telecommunications CapEx looks down and enterprise spending continues to be a bit weak, and industrial capital equipment seems to continue to be slowing a bit. So I would rather just hold off a quarter. We'll talk about it in more detail at the Investor Day here in May. But I think you have a pretty good framework for how we're thinking about it.\nUnidentified Analyst: A follow-up I have is regarding the M&A landscape like what are the sort of activity that you're currently seeing in this space and which is the target area for you in terms of end-markets for M&A? Thank you.\nPaul Lundstrom: Sure. So I would say our posture really hasn't changed on M&A, and I guess just kind of broadly talk about capital allocation. But we continue to have a pretty robust process and I would say a pretty robust pipeline. We're always looking at the landscape of opportunities. There's nothing large-scale that I would say is in the hopper. We're talking about technology acquisitions and other tuck-ins that we can make to sort of improve the capability of the enterprise, but not large-scale M&A. And if I think about how I would sort of prioritize M&A frankly, it's probably last unless we can get a really good deal. Continuing to focus on internal investment and make sure the business is well-funded for all the organic growth opportunities we think we have over the next several years, and that's a key priority for us. And the stock continues in our view to be a great opportunity to create more shareholder value. So we're going to continue to buy back stock.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. The only thing I'd add is if the areas where we would be interested in the technology are tuck-in acquisitions would be in the place of power -- embedded power, critical power-related to this which we have a really good sizable business and the products business would be focused around hyperscale and data center customers. So continue building out that part of our portfolio and the second would be around this continued growth in our value-added services business and things that add to that. So those are the areas we would be keen on and would be investing in as we look further. Like Paul said, but it comes second after buyback.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please state your question.\nMark Delaney: Yes. So thanks very much for taking the question. Starting on cloud market. As market you mentioned today is doing well. I believe Flex have been expecting about 20% growth in cloud driven by the multiple hyperscaler programs that have been ramping. Maybe you can talk a little bit more around how those are going operationally. Are you able to meet that demand? And how is growth in cloud tracking relative to your prior view of nearly 20% growth?\nRevathi Advaithi: Yeah. I'd say, Mark, the cloud business is doing really well. It will be north of -- well north of the 20% that we talked about earlier. And when we were previously talking about this, we were kind of hedging our bets to look at how the markets develop and all that. But overall, our cloud business for fiscal 2024, all said and done, would have grown well north of 20%. And I would say that we expect fiscal year 2025 to also be considerably strong for our cloud. And this includes not just our CEC business as you know and what we do there in terms of rack integration and all of that, but also our embedded power and our facilities power business sold. So pretty significant growth for cloud. Cloud will start to become almost as big as our -- at some point as our enterprise IT business. So it's catching up to that. So really good growth coming out of cloud and we expect fiscal 2025 to be good. Operationally I would say doing well. We are very pleased with how the program ramps are going. And it is a very large-scale program and we have made considerable progress on it and going well. So I'm pleased with it.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And my other question was just trying to better understand sort of mechanics in the fiscal 4Q guide. And in particular, it looks like the Company is expecting EBIT dollars in fiscal 4Q to increase sequentially to I think about $330 million at the midpoint up from I think the $315 million Core Flex did in the third quarter, even though revenue is dropping little over $300 million quarter-on-quarter. So maybe help us better understand if you could please what's allowing EBIT dollars and margin to improve so much even as revenue is falling in the coming quarter for guidance. Thank you.\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes. It's a good question, Mark, and so give you a little bit of clarity on that. So first, just to kind of go back to the third quarter because your question was that of sequential. So third quarter, we did $6.4 billion for Core Flex. That was 4.9% operating margin. You're exactly right. Our expectation here at the midpoint would be $6.1 billion of revenue in Q4. At $330 million, that would be 5.4% operating margin so nice certainly like the trajectory there. I would say it's a couple of things. One, if you look at the revenue, it's down sequentially. A piece of that, probably a third is just less recoveries. We talked a little bit about sort of the improving semiconductor market. We have less claims that are kind of going backwards that inflation pass-through effect that we've talked about now for probably a year and a half. And so I would say a little bit less sequential revenue just from claims. The rest is volume and that does drop through. However, mix is improving. That's a good guy. That would be one. Two, if you look at the tailwind we have from restructuring as we move from Q2 to Q3 to Q4, a lot of those programs that we talked about in the prepared remarks that $70 million or so were implemented as we move through the quarter. So you're going to have more benefit in the fourth quarter than you have in the third. So that's a good guy. And then the other one would just be, given sort of choppy end-markets and some volume contraction in some of our end-markets, we're taking other cost actions. I think it's just a prudent thing to do. So that kind of gets you to better margin mix cost-out restructuring tailwind.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please state your question.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just relative to your outlook and you pointed out several end markets where there is a weakness, but a quarter ago, you took a very big cut to your forward guidance based on customer order cuts. So the question is, have things gotten materially worse, or in terms of any cancellations or inventory issues at customers demand issues? Have things stabilized because it looks like your guidance is sort of in line with what we had previously expected?\nRevathi Advaithi: Yeah. Matt, I would say that it's in line with what we had previously expected. I would say when we took that correction, when we did, we really looked forward. We'd looked at the feedback we got from customers. We used a lot of our own intelligence and planning to understand what channel inventories look like, how these end markets are going to behave, and used a lot of our own intelligence to come up with what the forward-looking forecast was going to be and that's playing out to be in line with what we thought. I would say in terms of markets itself, just to give you a little color of what we're saying, I'm not -- we're not seeing any significant difference from what we saw. We had said before that cloud was fairly strong. Automotive was -- continues to be strong, but interest rates will be a watch item for that as you've heard several people talk about. In healthcare, we said it was mixed. It continues to be that way. I'd say industrial has been weak like we said before. And -- so overall, I'd say very similar. There's no kind of no new news to deliver. But what I am happy about is, you know, as you know it's hard to do a good forecast in this type of environment. So I think we came pretty close to trying to predict what we thought our end markets were going to do and it's in line with what we said.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the inventory reduction and expected cash flow, Paul, how should we think about the cadence of the share repurchase program? And can you remind us how much is left on your authorization?\nPaul Lundstrom: So left on the authorization, off the top of my head, I don't know that, but I'm sure David can pull it quickly, but let me tell you what kind of what we're thinking. So buyback this past quarter about $275 million or so. I would expect that we'll probably do close to twice that here in Q4. The cadence definitely steps up. If I were to just put a placeholder in there, I would say, go with $500 million give or take, which would put us at for the full fiscal year, somewhere in the order of $1.3 billion, which what we've talked about before. I think as we moved through the better part of -- the calendar year last year, a fair amount of stops and starts because we were in process for a lot of the Nextracker transaction, which means that we kind of got blacked out in some months. But we continue to believe that this is a nice value-creation opportunity in our own stock and hence the expected stepped-up cadence in our FY Q4 here.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Competitor Jabil also took down their guidance, but the strange thing there, they've taken down their second half more than the first half. I mean, if I look at your fiscal year 2025, the June quarter, September quarter, I mean their guidance would imply some weakness in the end markets. My question to you, Paul, is the $2.65 in earnings that you have for fiscal 2025, even without either restating that or not, can you remind us what are some of the margin improvement levers that you have? So that even if revenues are weaker in the first half of fiscal 2025, what are your thoughts as to like what you can do in terms of margin improvement to help get PPAs to where you want to get to?\nRevathi Advaithi: Yeah. Ruplu, I'll start and Paul can jump in. First, I'll tell you is that we have shown this year, right, our ability to really manage our decrementals really well, either through a variety of different ways, whether it is through improved cost management, driving strong productivity and efficiency in our factories, and then, of course, our end-markets in terms of where we are participating and mix has also helped overall. So when I look at kind of first-half versus second half, frankly, Ruplu, I mean at this point, it's too early to talk about FY 2025, but I don't have in notes like second half as a huge recovery. I think in general, FY 2025 will be an interesting year. But I'd say our view is that we have tremendous room in terms of driving factory automation and productivity, and we have seen that play out this year and we'll continue to drive that into next year. So, fundamental operating efficiency and productivity driven by factory improvement is going to be a core part of this. Our mix will continue to improve so things like value-added services, growth coming from power and hyperscale, all those are critical areas where we will see margin improvement driven by that. So I think those are the ways that we continue to see margin improvement. And then we also have a tailwind from restructuring that we just did that will continue to flow through into next year. So those are all the ways we're thinking continued margin improvement and I think this year and the last few years have proven that we can deliver it.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Right. Thanks for the details there, Revathi. For my follow-up, I want to ask you another broad-picture question. So now that Flex is Core Flex ex Nextracker, where do you think your investments will be more, which end-market or which segment? And as you look out beyond this near-term weakness in the end markets, what do you think will drive growth for Flex? I mean which end market or which sector, and where would you want to invest your CapEx? And I know, for example, you've got a big cloud customer you talked about but -- I mean, any areas? Is it reliability that you want to invest in? Is it the Agility or both? Any thoughts there?\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes, Ruplu, thanks for that question. We're going to talk a lot more about this in our Investor Day, but just giving you a preview of that would be. We'll continue to invest significantly, both in commercial and in capacity growth for power related to cloud, and that's going to be a considerable part of our growth. I would say cloud itself within our CEC segment so that is focused on kind of AI and hyperscale growth will be continued investment for us. So this theme is kind of in line with what we talked about last Investor Day, and that has proven to be a very good commitment of our resources, and that'll continue to be a major macro growth driver for us. I would say the second would be, you have -- we'll talk more about this in a few months, but value-added services, which is the combination of recycling waste management but also things like additional component services or more vertical integration across our end-to-end wallet share of our customers is a significant part of our growth strategy, and that has proven to be -- has had good tailwind over the last few years and we expect that to be a continued growth focus for us and we'll discuss that more. And then of course everything around electrification will be -- I mean, we continue to increase our wallet share in the automotive market and that'll be a growth area also. So if I look at the macros, those are very much in line with areas that I think are good growth drivers, not just for Flex, but you'll see that reflected in the industry itself. So those will be our focus areas.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions from me. First of all, on the cash flows looking ahead. Now that we're looking at Core Flex business into next fiscal year, can you give us a sense for how we sort of some rule of thumb on working capital, especially as you finish up the year, it sounds like working down some inventory. And then I have a follow-up.\nPaul Lundstrom: Yeah. I think the good news on this Steven is we do continue to see progress on inventory. And I don't want to guide on FY2025 yet. We're still kind of working through that process, but I certainly like the momentum and how things have sort of loosened up a little bit. My only hedge on that would be we supported the inventory growth with working capital advances from customers, and those will kind of unwind together. Maybe not exactly the same time but those kind of come down generally simultaneously. But yeah, I mean expect more good things to come when it comes to cash because I do see a working capital unwind here as we look forward over the next couple of years.\nSteven Fox: Okay. And then just -- I mean, there's been a lot of interesting comments on the served markets. Just stepping back for a second, I noticed sort of justified reason for not getting too specific on fiscal 2025, but it also sounds like you haven't seen any other leg down. So can you just sort of express to us like what your biggest concerns are as you head into the new fiscal year that are out of your control? Thanks very much.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yeah. Paul, do you want to start?\nPaul Lundstrom: I would say -- I mean, Revathi and I probably -- we worry about lots of things, but -- and maybe they're slightly different but mine would be -- I worry a little bit about the end markets. I think the operations are well managed and I think we've demonstrated that we can grow earnings despite end-market contractions. And I think we have enough levers to pull that I think you can see great operating performance despite a tough year here in FY 2024. But revenue is one of those things that until the stops going down, it's not going up. And so I do worry a little bit about things like telecommunication infrastructure, enterprise IT spending, you know, what's going to happen with medical equipment, which would be more of the CapEx and medical centers? But boy, there's a lot of tailwinds right now and cloud seems to be going quite well. I think automotive has held up well despite interest rates. I think there's parts of the industrial business that it's getting maybe bad press globally right now, but man, we have some great opportunities and I continue to be pretty bullish on. The supply chain continuity argument is such a tailwind for the macro in EMS and especially for Flex. I think that's going to be a good guide for us over the next several years. So there is some specific end-market challenges that I'm a little bit anxious about, but I think the -- overall the macro is pretty good for companies in our industry and we just need to execute.\nRevathi Advaithi: I have nothing to add. I think that's well said.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question comes from George Wang with Barclays. Please state your question.\nGeorge Wang: Well, hey, guys, congrats on the quarter. Just I have two quick ones. So, firstly, just looking at the guidance for the free cash flow, 4Q seems very strong, especially, so they more than doubled sequentially from a Core Flex standpoint. Maybe you can kind of double-click some puts and takes on the driver obviously, aside from some factors you mentioned and some core inventory and some working capital advances reductions. Just curious kind of additional leverage you guys have as we look out to FY 2025.\nPaul Lundstrom: Sure, George. No problem. So one thing I'll just point out is we do tend to be a little seasonal on cash flow. Our fiscal year end is March. You have a lot of our customers' fiscal year end is December, and so there can be a little bit of timing between our Q3 and customers' Q4. And so Q3 tends to be a little on the light side. Q4 for us tends to be much better as some customers sort of hold checks as they get to their year-end. So seasonally we tend to be a little bit better. That's part of it. We're definitely making some nice progress now on inventory. As I had kind of mentioned to Steven, working capital advances and inventory will broad brush, I would say, will come down sort of simultaneously. But that should continue to be a tailwind for us as we unwind some of that inventory from that chip shortage we dealt with over the last couple of years. My only other comment I would say -- this is a typical CFO comment. I really don't like giving quarterly guidance and please don't expect that going forward. The reason we were so sort of clear and prescriptive here on Q4 was I think it's important for people to understand how things look post Nextracker separation. And so that $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow we're expecting in Q4, typically I wouldn't make that sort of guide. And plus or minus that, but generally speaking, we feel pretty good about where we are now for the year.\nGeorge Wang: Got it. Just a quick follow-up, just kind of trying to hone in on the AI kind of power in hyperscale so exposure there. Just -- are you able to quantify the revenue contribution for this particular segment? So enjoying kind of over 20% growth, kind of what's the mix roughly versus total Flex revenue? And do you guys sort of incorporate some of the share gains as well aside from -- so they obviously, a growing pie for the AI industry in the large? It's now like some share gain as well maybe you guys have taken versus other OEMs out there given such a double-digit strong growth rate. Maybe you can give additional color on those.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yeah. George, we'll talk a little bit more about this in our Investor Day. But we haven't shared. I mean, you know, in our markets because we bought that business and so that revenue is known, but it's grown dramatically since we bought it. We haven't shared our embedded power business and those numbers publicly in our value-added services numbers that go into hyperscale. So those haven't been shared so I would say, if I look at kind of AI growth and overall growth for us in hyperscale across these capabilities, all of those are fairly strong. Yeah. We've definitely clearly took share I would say in the CEC segment. In the embedded power segment, we don't really have major competitors who have our capability -- our product capability and I would say -- so we feel very comfortable with the fact that we're taking share in the right way and not really from ODMs because we don't like to compete with ODM margin so I would say more in terms of being able to sell our overall value so the margin accretion also is in line with what we would be looking for. So more to come on that I'd say, here in a few months, but we'll definitely focus on kind of AI and data center growth as it relates to us. But we feel really good about the growth associated with that for us.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Sounds good. Thanks a lot.\nRevathi Advaithi: Okay. I think that was the last question. So thank you. We look forward to speaking with you again when we hold our investor event in conjunction with our fiscal Q4 earnings call. I would like to on behalf of my leadership team want to say thank you to all our customers and our shareholders for their support, and of course the Flex team across the globe for their dedication and contributions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Rubin. You may begin.\nDavid Rubin: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and welcome to Flex’s second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Revathi Advaithi; and our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Lundstrom. Both will give brief remarks followed by Q&A. Slides for today’s call as well as a copy of the earnings press release and summary financials are available on the Investor Relations section at flex.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our corporate Web site. As a reminder, today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and assumptions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary statements in our presentation, press release or the Risk Factors section in our recent filings with the SEC. Note this information is subject to change, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all results provided will be non-GAAP measures and all growth metrics will be on a year-over-year basis. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations can be found in the appendix slides of today’s presentation as well as the Investor Relations Web site. Earlier today, we were pleased to announce our plan to spin-off all of Flex’s remaining interest in Nextracker to Flex shareholders. As previously disclosed, Flex retained the option to effect the spin-off pursuant to a merger agreement entered into by Flex and Nextracker in connection with Nextracker’s initial public offering. We believe that the spin-off is the most advantageous form separation for Flex, Nextracker and our respective shareholders.  Specifically, it provides the opportunity to distribute Flex’s interest in Nextracker to Flex shareholders in a tax free manner for U.S. federal income tax purposes and allows Flex to focus on our core strategies and long-term value creation for our shareholders. As earlier today, Nextracker filed a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary proxy statement of Flex, which includes additional information regarding the spin-off.  The spin-off is currently expected to be completed in Flex’s fourth quarter ending March 31, 2024 but does remain subject to a number of conditions and no assurance can be given that the spin-off will in fact occur. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details to share other than what has been publicly made available. But we will provide any updates as appropriate. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Revathi.\nRevathi Advaithi: Thank you, David. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Before we start, I want to say how deeply saddened we are by the horrific attacks on Israel. Our hearts go out to our colleagues, our customers and our friends in that area.  Turning to our quarterly results on Slide 5. Overall, fiscal Q2 was another strong quarter with great execution. Revenue came in at 7.5 billion which was down about 4%, adjusted operating margin came in at 5.9% and we delivered $0.68 of adjusted EPS.  Since we have now announced the separation of Nextracker, we are able to provide core Flex’s results, which excludes Nextracker. For core Flex, we executed really well even with the market uncertainty. Revenue came in at 6.9 billion, down 5% against a great quarter last year, which grew 24%.  Core Flex adjusted operating margin came in at 4.7%, up both sequentially and year-over-year, and we delivered $0.56 of adjusted EPS. I'm really pleased with how these results show their ability to execute and build a resilient company with strong performance through the cycles. Now turning to Slide 6. We'll take a look at market fundamentals and how we continue to navigate a highly dynamic environment. However, I want to point out a few important items that really puts into perspective the strength of our model and how we have truly evolved as a company.  As you're well aware, we participate in six end markets. But within that, we've been focused on shifting our portfolio more towards next gen mobility, cloud and digital health. As highlighted in our March 2022 Investor Day, we believe these markets drive the right growth and margin expansion for us, so I'd like to give some specifics on how we're doing in these areas.  Next gen mobility as we have defined it comprises our EV, ADAS autonomous and our EV charging businesses. At the time of Investor Day, we expected a 50% plus CAGR for this space. We continue to see growth in this category on par with these strong expectations.  Looking at our overall automotive business, once again this quarter, our revenue growth outpaced industry units. This strength comes from past program wins coupled with continued steady vehicle content expansion.  We expect our cloud business to grow just under 20% per year, based on unique ability to manufacture vertically integrated data center racks and critical power systems for the data center. Even with the increasing trend towards consignment, we're on track to beat these growth expectations this year and also next year. This is based on what we have already won with multiple top tier hyperscalers, but much of that growth currently driven by generative AI capability expansions.  Lastly, we said our digital healthcare business would have just over a 10% CAGR. We expect that multi-year trend to continue. Right now, we're seeing exceptional growth in our next generation of smarter and smaller devices, including continuous glucose monitors and diabetes drug delivery programs. I'd say the only changes in our life sciences business, but that is just short-term inventory digestion up for an extended period of strong growth.  One area we touched on during our Investor Day was clean energy transition opportunity. Last quarter, we announced that our renewables business doubled in our last fiscal year. Despite some lingering weakness in residential solar, we still expect renewables to grow again in fiscal '24. And it is still early days as we look at the potential opportunity from the IRA and other government initiatives to help drive the clean energy transition and upgrade grid infrastructure. Our stated intention at our Investor Day was to focus on these strategic end markets, which has made Flex a more resilient company. Now let's discuss combining the right end market with how we are operating as a company. Flex is a more agile and operationally efficient company and you'll see that in our results with steady margin expansion and EPS growth. Our continued optimization of our mix and our factory footprint combined with driving productivity through automation investments has enabled operating margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year for core Flex. We also expect this trend to continue and we'll discuss this further when we get to guidance.  We have been shaping the company in this direction over the last five years. And we see the impact of our efforts in our improving results and shareholder value creation. Now speaking of creating shareholder value, we're executing on our path to unlock the value of Nextracker. Through this journey, we have created value with multiple transactions growing cash to help fund our capital allocation strategy.  We use cash from the pre-IPO TPG investment to fund the Anord Mardix acquisition, which is focused on cloud facilities and critical power. This addition clearly checks all the right boxes for value creation. It delivers double digit growth, is margin accretive and is synergistic to our overall position in the cloud market.  We believe Flex is a great investment. So we're also putting cash from the transactions to work buying back our own stock. Year-to-date, we bought back 500 million worth of stock. And you recall our Board authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program back in August. Now we're in the final steps to fully unlock the Nextracker value in a shareholder-friendly transaction. As David outlined, we expect to distribute our remaining 51% ownership to Flex investors via a tax free spin in fiscal Q4.  With that, I'll pass the call over to Paul to take you through our financial update. Paul?\nPaul Lundstrom: Okay. Thank you, Revathi. I'll begin with our second quarter performance on Slide 8. It was another solid quarter. Second quarter revenue was 7.5 billion, in line with our expectations. Gross profit totaled 676 million and gross margin increased to 9%, up 130 basis points. Operating income was 439 million with operating margins at 5.9%, a substantial year-on-year improvement, up 110 basis points and earnings per share came in at $0.68 for the quarter increasing 8% which includes $0.08 of Nextracker non-controlling interest.  Looking at core Flex results, which excludes Nextracker, in the quarter, core Flex revenue was 6.9 billion, down 5%. And as Revathi mentioned, this was against a great quarter last year, up 24%, which was our strongest quarter in fiscal year '23. Core Flex adjusted operating margins came in at 4.7%, up 20 basis points, and with another quarter of sequential margin expansion, up 40 basis points from Q1. The Flex core business delivered $0.56 of EPS, up 6%.  Turning to our quarterly segment results on the next slide, Reliability revenue was flat at 3.3 billion. Auto and health solutions remained strong with some headwinds from residential solar and industrial. Operating income was 171 million and operating margin for the segment improved sequentially to 5.2% on solid execution.  In Agility, revenue was down as expected to 3.6 billion as strong cloud growth was offset by the anticipated pressure in comms, enterprise IT and consumer. Operating income came in at 168 million with a solid 4.6% operating margin, up both sequentially and year-on-year and was reflective of strong operational management and improved mix.  Finally, Nextracker delivered revenue of 573 million, up 21%. Operating income at Nextracker was 112 million more than double what it was last year, delivering a strong 20% operating margin.  Moving to cash flow on Slide 10. We made further progress against our inventory improvement goals reducing net inventory by 5% sequentially and by 7% year-over-year. As we said last quarter, this is an indicator of the overall situation improving and we expect to see further progress over the coming quarters.  We continue to invest in future growth opportunities. Q2 CapEx came in at 144 million on target at 2% of revenue. We expect to maintain a similar total investment level for the full fiscal 2024. All that led to free cash flow of 213 million which was up both sequentially and year-over-year. As we've committed to, we continue to prioritize opportunistic share repurchases. We bought back 309 million worth of stock in the quarter and fiscal year-to-date we have purchased 506 million. As discussed earlier, in August, the Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program.  Please continue to Slide 11 for our segment outlook for the fiscal third quarter. For Reliability Solutions, we expect revenue will be down high single digits to low teens. Auto demand has been steady. However, with the UAW strikes unresolved, we're taking a more conservative approach in the quarter. We also expect some continued weakness in parts of industrial. Revenue in Agility is expected to be down mid teens to low 20% with strong growth in cloud offset by near-term weakness in comms, enterprise IT and consumer.  Onto Slide 12 for a quarterly guidance. For total Flex, we expect revenue in the range of 6.5 billion to 6.9 billion, with operating income between 375 million and 425 million. Interest in other expense is estimated to be around 50 million. We expect the tax rate to be around 11% for the quarter. All that translates to adjusted EPS between $0.57 and $0.65 based on approximately 448 million weighted average shares outstanding. This guidance includes approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of non-controlling interest from Nextracker.  Again, to provide some additional visibility, we included our expectations for core Flex, excluding Nextracker. For Q3, we now expect core revenue to be between 5.9 billion and 6.3 billion, core adjusted operating income between 280 million and 310 million which equates to adjusted operating margins between 4.7% and 4.9%. At the midpoint, this would be up both sequentially and year-over-year.  Core Flex adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.47 and $0.52. And looking at our GAAP guidance, we've included approximately 100 million in restructuring, which we expect to implement in Q3. Looking at our full year guidance on the following slide, until the separation, we will provide guidance for total Flex, including Nextracker, which remains comparable to our prior guidance. We now expect full year revenue between 28.1 billion and 28.8 billion, adjusted operating margin now between 5.8% and 6%, and adjusted EPS between $2.49 and $2.66 per share. This includes approximately $0.30 to $0.35 in non-controlling interest expense from Nextracker. Looking at our full year expectations for core Flex, to be clear, this excludes Nextracker for the entire year. Again, this is something new to help you with modeling and is not comparable to previous total Flex guidance. We expect full year revenue for core Flex between 25.9 billion and 26.5 billion, adjusted operating margins between 4.8% and 4.9%, which at the midpoint would be up about half a point year-on-year, and last adjusted EPS between $2.05 and $2.18.  On the next slide, I want to highlight just how much Flex has changed as we have shifted to higher value business and improved operationally to manage through the cycles. As you can see, our revenue outlook for FY '24 has changed resulting from some short-term market challenges. However, despite some pressure on the top line, our expectation is that both operating profit dollars and core Flex EPS will hold strong and the operating margin rates will continue to expand.  This comes from executing on a portfolio strategy towards higher value businesses, our constant drive to improve operating efficiency and continuously optimizing our cost structure, as we have told you that we would. This is another proof point on how we've evolved and improved and are now operating at a level better than at any time in the company's history.\nRevathi Advaithi: Thank you, Paul. Overall, I'm really pleased with how we're executing our strategy on portfolio management, focused on the right kind of growth and driving margin expansion. This combined with executing the capital allocation strategy with a strong focus on buybacks is how we provide value to our shareholders.  We expect an extraordinarily strong year for Flex with continued margin performance and EPS growth, even with the near-term challenges. This is also a good time for me to reiterate our Investor Day targets for fiscal '25 getting to core Flex adjusted EPS of $2.65. So we remain confident in the long-term opportunity for Flex.  With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, John, to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you very much and good afternoon. Just a question relative to your guidance versus 90 days ago, it looks like you're taking down both expectations for both Reliability and Agility pretty significantly. We talked a little bit about some auto headwinds and some of the data comm markets still being weak. But could you tell us exactly what you've seen from customers in terms of their order patterns? And are we hitting the bottom in some of these markets? Or do you expect continued deterioration as we get into calendar '24?\nPaul Lundstrom: Hi, Matt. So first of all, I appreciate the question. I think it's spot on. Let me just give you some specifics, and Revathi might have some comments as well. But what we had previously called out was weakness in more of our consumer-facing markets. And in particular, I'll just give you one example. Our consumer device business, which is within the Agility segment, we figured would be down for the year around mid teens. But based on what we're hearing from customers today, we're thinking it'll be down more like 25%, so mid teens to 25, a fairly significant change on those consumer-facing markets. We had called out a softening in comms infrastructure before. Our thought had been that should be probably flat for the year but with the ongoing inventory digestion and what we're seeing in some of those end markets right now, what you guys are all seeing too, we're expecting comms to be down more like 10% for the year for us. Auto has been strong. But now we're sitting in week six of this UAW strike and we're seeing some impact here in Q3, so we're taking a little bit more conservative approach. That said, we're still expecting growth overall for the automotive business. And then I guess, lastly, just a little on renewable. We were expecting robust double digit growth for the year. But given what you're seeing right now in some of the residential solar space, it will still be up but it will probably be up more like low single digit. So those are some of the bigger end markets we've seen some contraction, but I guess I would sort of book in that comment by saying, although things are choppy in some areas, things like next gen mobility looks great; cloud, great; digital health continues really nice to see some things there. So they just unfortunately just can't quite offset some of what we're seeing there in some of those other end markets.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it.\nRevathi Advaithi: Matt, the only thing I'll add to what Paul said is that one of the things we've talked about consistently for Flex in the last few years is you have to have the right portfolio but you also have to have the right operational strategy to be agile and more operationally efficient. And you can see that playing out right now in our results with our margin expansion, EPS growth. So it's really well managed through the cycle, which is what you're seeing present out today. So market choppiness will be there. I think how we execute as a company is important, and we're pleased with that.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thanks for all that, very helpful. And as my follow up, just regarding you reiterating that $2.65 EPS target for fiscal '25, obviously, it looks like significant growth off of what you're guiding the core business for '24. So how much of that is going to come from the core business growing, margins expanding versus the buyback making up for that deficit?\nPaul Lundstrom: It's going to be a combination of the three, Matt. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and guide too many of the specifics on that. We need to get through the next six months here, but I think it will be a combination of some top line growth, some margin expansion, which I think kind of makes sense, given our momentum here, and probably some buyback as well. \nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. First of all, given the further progress in margins even though you're seeing weakness in some end markets, it seems to strike a chord that like some of the markets that are softening are even lower margin, below average than I would have thought. So I was curious, like, how many of these markets where maybe you're still not getting average margins, would you consider either exiting, repricing, reconsidering the strategy in some ways? I'm just curious how pliable you're going to be towards some of these other markets going forward? Thanks.\nPaul Lundstrom: Sure. So I wouldn't say there's any major end markets we’re planning on exiting. But I would sort of caveat that statement, Steven, by saying portfolio management is a constant process, and we're always evaluating and maybe not “divesting” per se, but deemphasizing. I think your comment on mix is spot on. It's kind of nice that some of those end markets that I pointed out to happen to be sort of lower margin, if you look at the Flex aggregate. And so as I think about how we're moving with some market choppiness and kind of a guide down on the top line, mix definitely helps. Mix definitely helps. I don't know, is that helpful commentary?\nSteven Fox: Well, I'm just wondering --\nRevathi Advaithi: Maybe, Steven, the one thing I'll add is just to say is managing mix and portfolio kind of has been our key theme in the last five years. If you look at what we have done overall in the Agility business and consumer devices, all of that within each of the end markets, we've really managed our mix pretty significantly in terms of moving up the value chain. That's why you see Agility’s margins being such a strong performance, even with the end markets it's in. So our belief is that within these end markets that our pockets that are extremely strong, that really helps us and then there are others that will keep shrinking in size. Nothing significant to talk about, but I think it's part of managing the portfolio even within all the six end markets. It doesn't matter whether they are under Reliability or Agility I see that normal course of action.\nSteven Fox: Okay, that's definitely helpful. And then I was wondering if you could dial in a little bit more on the auto market. You mentioned the UAW strike, but away from that, can you talk about just maturity of programs and whether they're contributing to margins, how sort of the program ramps look into next year, because you seem pretty bullish on new programs continuing to ramp even though there's been a lot of sort of negative headlines in the last couple of months on EVs and things like that?\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. I'd say -- I'll start with saying that a few years ago, we kind of stated our intention in automotive to really drive our focus on what we call next gen mobility. And our EV platform that I've talked about before, which is a combination of our own designs and designs that we work on with our customers, has been very successful in different geographies and also in North America in terms of winning platforms. We talked about large bookings expansion in automotive, which will take kind of two to five years to ramp up and get to maximum volume production. But that is our strategy on automotive. And we can see that in terms of our bookings and our core volume growth, both in automotive. I'd say that the noise that you see today in terms of EV is kind of part of I would say the growing pains that you're going to see in any end markets that is going through such a hyper growth cycle. And we see that that's a good thing. We believe that there's good growth to be had. We also think there is disruption in the overall supply chain in automotive, which provides a great opportunity for EMS companies like Flex. So you put all that together, I would say my overall view on EVs and in automotive is that it is a good place for Flex to be. And we continue to have really strong growth as a result of that. And we want to be diversified in our automotive EV end markets.\nSteven Fox: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.\nPaul Lundstrom: Thanks, Steven.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. It looks like on the core business, your expectation for revenues has gone down about 2.6 billion, but the expectation for operating margins is 40 bps better. So I was wondering if you can delve a little bit deeper into both the revenue side and on the margins, specifically on renewables, like how much of your business is tied to residential versus utility scale? And how do you see that progressing over the year? And then on automotive, are you tied more to the North American OEMs or the Europeans? And how do you see that mix changing as the mix gets more towards EVs? And then just on the margins, that 40 bps of improvement, does that come more from Reliability or Agility? And Paul, in the past, you've talked about things like components, the lagging at semiconductors being an issue, is that now done? And what is driving that 40 bps, if you can just delve into that margin improvement on lower revenues?\nPaul Lundstrom: Well, the good news, Ruplu, is that there will be no more sell-siders that ask questions, because I think you hit a homerun there. But I'm just teasing. So let me start with revenue. I called out a few of the end markets that we're seeing declines. By the way, by my math, the midpoint about $2.5 billion down. Consumer devices was a piece. We talked a little bit about renewable. We talked about being a little bit more conservative with auto. We talked about comms infrastructure. So I think those are going to be some of the bigger drivers partially offset by continued growth in the areas that Revathi and I have been talking about for a couple of years now. Next gen mobility and auto, cloud, digital health all look pretty good. So that's what drove the derate on revenue. You asked about utility versus resi for renewables. First, I'll just say, and I think we've disclosed this before, that the renewables business is now well over $1 billion for Flex. It's a big piece of the business. There's some confidentiality around customers. We have made some disclosures that would -- in partnership with our customers, so I think you know that. There's a couple names out there that tend to be more in the residential space. And that's where we've been pinched here a little bit in terms of some forecast changes and a little bit of choppiness, but our long-term view remains very bullish on that whole renewables space, and we do expect it to continue to grow. You asked about automotive, I would say we're fairly well geographically dispersed. We're not overly concentrated in North America. So although the UAW, we are expecting and seeing some impact here in Q3 that doesn't affect Europe, it doesn't affect China so much. In terms of margins, so $2.5 billion sales cut with no change to OP. There's a couple of things that are in our favor on that. One, and this is what I think Steven well pointed out, the margin mix helps. We’re seeing volume reductions in areas where our margin rates tend to be a little bit lower. And so that definitely helps. I would say that's one. Two, I did mention in the prepared remarks there is going to be some restructuring here in the third quarter, and there's going to be tailing both in Q3 and Q4 for that. And then, three, Q2 came in a little bit better. And so that's dropping through. And so I think those three pieces kind of help us to hold the line on operating profit. And then the last thing that you asked about was recoveries. So if I think about the full year revenue year-on-year for core Flex, recoveries are down meaningfully versus what we thought over the last couple of quarters. I would say that's very good news for a couple of reasons. One, it's going to have a beneficial impact on inventory as chip shortage thing. Although there is still tightness in some areas, it's gotten much, much better. And that helps with cost too, cost pass through included. And so when I think about full year, I think at the midpoint of our guide, high single digit down for the full year, I would guess at this point, maybe half of that comes from changes in pass through. So it's not all the revenue headwinds that you're seeing are core markets, some of that is just inflation pass through, as you knew that we would see when things got a little bit more normal.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Yes, thanks for all the details. I really appreciate you going into all of that. Just real quick on that quick follow up. Now that you've announced the remaining Nextracker transaction, does that change your philosophy around capital return and pace of buybacks? How should we think about that? Thank you. Thanks for all the details.\nPaul Lundstrom: No problem. And so we've talked about our capital allocation priorities before and I would say, number one, we're never going to starve the core business. We’re quite bullish on a number of our end markets. And so we're never going to starve ourselves for things like CapEx or other internal investments. The number two priority, and this is a high, high priority, is share buyback. We continue to believe that there's a significant disconnect. Hopefully, with the Nextracker separation, people sort of realize the arbitrage there and things sort of rationalize a little bit. I would say probably the distant third at the moment would be M&A. As always, we reserve the right to change our minds. But stock buyback is clearly the expected use of free cash.\nRevathi Advaithi: And the only thing I'd add is I'll remind you that our Board recently authorized $2 billion stock authorization, right, and so we expect to continue to just return cash back to our shareholders. \nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thank you.\nPaul Lundstrom: Thanks, Ruplu.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and I have just two here. Just parsing through all the numbers that you've disclosed, when I look at 3Q guide versus 4Q implied in there, there's a modest uptick in revenue and a modest uptick in profit that I get to and I hope I'm doing the math right here. But just wondering how much of that is the cloud customer related projects you've talked about? Or is there something else embedded in there in terms of recovery going from 3Q to 4Q? And any sense you can give us on the timing of those [indiscernible] projects? Are they starting in 3Q and then ramping to 4Q? Or is it more of a 4Q event in the numbers? And then I have a quick follow up? Thank you.\nPaul Lundstrom: Sure, Samik. So yes, there is some ramp tailwind as we move through Q4, as we continue to ramp cloud as a piece of it. There's a couple of others that we expect to benefit from as well. There's a number of these new platforms that we've been talking about that should give us some continued growth. It's the three areas that we've been talking about. It’s next gen mobility, it’s cloud as you pointed out, and health solutions should continue to do well in the smart tech device things. You mentioned margins. I do expect a little bit of a margin uptick as well as we move from Q3 to Q4. That's really just a full quarter of restructuring tailwind.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. And on that point, the second question was, you did mention on the core, you're seeing about a 50 basis points margin expansion in fiscal '24 when you sort of adjust all the Nextracker numbers out. Just wondering if you can share your thoughts about sustainability of that pace of improvement going into next year, how much of the reliability improvement through the year is on account of price increases that you start to lap in fiscal '25? And how should we think about sustainability of that piece?\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. Samik, I would say first is margin -- steady margin expansion has been a core part of our story the last four to five years, right, and through the different cycles we've seen. We've been very consistent in our ability to drive margin expansion. So I view the 50 basis points margin expansion as sustainable and continue to track in the way of margin expansion. And it comes from the things we talked about. One is definitely continued change in our mix, right? Our focus is more on growing areas like cloud, next gen mobility, digital health care, all of those that are better margins, so mix plays a role in it for sure. We have done a lot around optimization of our factories and driving productivity through automation, through CapEx investments. So that is very sustainable. So if I look at how we're getting margin expansion, I would say that it's a very sustainable story. And I think it's good that we have been able to do that consistently. And reiterating FY '25 EPS also points in that direction.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPaul Lundstrom: Thanks, Samik.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Wang from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Wang: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions, if I can. Firstly, I just want to double click on the buyback. You mentioned that authorized 2 billion buyback. Just curious about cadence, especially kind of [indiscernible] around the spin-off timing, which is kind of in the last quarter 2024? And also I was looking at the share count kind of seems to be flat based on guide for 3Q versus 2Q, obviously, you may do some buybacks to offset dilution. Just curious, any sort of color you can provide in terms of the cadence and kind of linearity of the buybacks? And should we assume a similar sort of intermittent run rate for the next few quarters or it could be some technicality around the spin-off timing?\nPaul Lundstrom: Well, the good news is now quiet periods are essentially over, because it's out in the public domain that we do intend to spin. And so that has sort of created some stops and starts over the last -- really over the last two years. So that helps a little bit. We give our last quarter share count as sort of -- as part of our guide. I think you've known us to continue to buy stock as we've moved through the quarters. And so that's probably a slightly conservative view, if you want to read into that a little bit. In terms of specific cadence, I'm not going to say exactly what we intend to buy here in our third quarter or our fourth other than to say stock buyback is clearly a capital allocation priority for us.\nGeorge Wang: Got it. Thanks for that. Just to quickly follow up just in terms of the free cash flow kind of potentially could be a big driver for the share price appreciation. It's nice to see 2Q delivered much a strong FCF versus kind of 1Q being a cash use. Just curious, if you guys are reiterating 600 million or above in terms of full year FCF, and is there any potential upside just based on the better margin providing the backup?\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes, it's a great question. And so I'll just say predicting cash flow is a little trickier than predicting the P&L. It can kind of bounce around a little bit. But what we're going to do is we're going to update everyone about the free cash flow expectation targets once the separation is complete. And here's the logic on that. There's lots of puts and takes from Nextracker specifically. And because the timing is not perfectly certain, other than we expect it sometime in Q4, it's just a little hard to predict. But what I want to make sure is clear. We're definitely headed in the right direction. We're particularly pleased with how we did in Q2. We generated -- like you said, we generated north of 200 million in free cash flow. That was up significantly both year-on-year and also sequentially. I'm quite pleased with our inventory performance as it came down again in the quarter. We inflected a couple quarters back, and I like to see the continued progress there. And that free cash generation was after 145 million in CapEx. So we're clearly not under investing in the business. So I would say nothing has fundamentally changed. And we still expect to grow free cash flow.\nGeorge Wang: Great, thanks again. I'll go back to the queue.\nPaul Lundstrom: Thanks, George, and welcome.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nMark Delaney: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned mix as a key tailwind to core Flex margins going from fiscal 2Q to 3Q and as total revenue declines. But is there anything additional in terms of incremental pricing or large restructuring programs that may also be playing a key role in the sequential margin strength? And if so, could you dimensionalize how large those other drivers may be?\nPaul Lundstrom: Sure. So just I’m clear on your question, are you talking Q2 to Q3, Mark?\nMark Delaney: Yes, from the four seven [ph] you just did, I think the midpoint of guidance is for a -- you mentioned mix is one of the key drivers as to how margins are actually even maybe expanding a little bit as revenue drops. But is there anything with restructuring programs you just did or incremental pricing that may also be playing a role to just try to think through some of the buckets and pieces that are helping margins in the upcoming quarter based on guidance?\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes, got it. Okay. So I would say probably the biggest singular tailwind is our continued push on productivity programs. In our prepared remarks, you did flag that we pointed out some restructuring. We're going to have benefit from that both in Q3 and also in Q4. But mix is definitely a factor. You look at some of the end markets that are contracting right now, they tend to earn a little less than other parts of the core portfolio. And so we've sort of been a beneficiary of that mix. You asked about pricing, nothing significant to comment on there. I would say it's a combination of productivity programs and mix.\nRevathi Advaithi: And we’re really, Mark, driving a lot of factory optimization. And that's, like Paul said, that is a big driver.\nMark Delaney: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for all the details on that. And then I know guidance on Nextracker, but just a level set on where you stand currently. Do you still need government approvals or tax rulings in order to do the spin, or do you have all those in place now with the announcement that you're making today?\nDavid Rubin: Mark, this is David. Yes, it's all outlined in the S-4. I know you haven't had time to peruse it all 400 pages, but that will have the outlines of what approvals we've gotten. We still have the shareholder vote. That's on November 20. But otherwise, we're moving in process.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thanks so much for taking the questions.\nDavid Rubin: Early Q4 is what we're thinking, guys.\nRevathi Advaithi: And I think that was our last question.\nPaul Lundstrom: Great. Thank you all.\nRevathi Advaithi: Okay. Thank you all for joining. I just want to thank the Flex team on behalf of the leadership team and of course to all our customers and our shareholders for your support. So thank you all. Thanks for joining.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call."

Now, I’d like to turn the call over to our CEO. Revathi?\nRevathi Advaithi: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we move into our new fiscal year, we continue to make progress in our long-term strategy and deliver consistent results. Starting with our fiscal Q1 results on slide 4. Overall, it was another solid quarter. Revenue came in at $7.3 billion, which is flat with last year’s exceptionally strong Q1. Adjusted operating margin came in at 5.1% and we delivered $0.57 of adjusted EPS. On July 3rd, we completed a follow-on offering for Nextracker. We still own about 51% of the company, but this marks yet another significant step forward. Now turning to slide 5. Now, looking at core Flex fundamentals, we continue to navigate the dynamic macro environment with trends in the current quarter relatively in line with our expectations. Consumer facing markets remained soft from several factors, including higher interest rates and lingering post-COVID spending normalization in a few areas. As we indicated last quarter, we also experienced some slowing in enterprise IT, but so far it is performing to our prior expectations and we continue to monitor demand indicators. On the other hand, we also faced a difficult comp this year in CEC, after it grew 30% last year. However, we continue to see strength in most of our secular driven markets, and that’s one of the benefits of having our well diversified portfolio. There’s a lot of hype around AI right now. Maybe I can help separate a little fact from fiction, at least for what it means to us. We all know that the compute and power requirements of generative AI are highly intensive. This has led to changing technical requirements in the data center. From a manufacturing perspective, these changing needs are creating new opportunities, I should say, however, this has been the trend for a little while now and it’s already driving some of our business. In CEC, we’ve talked about share gains driven by our bespoke cloud offering based on our unique design, vertically integrated manufacturing and value added fulfillment solutions. That is what helped drive triple digit growth in our cloud business last year. These same capabilities have led to additional wins, including one ramping in the back half of this year. With our expertise in power, we have developed a new power module solution, which for example, is suited to the needs of the more intensive GPU-based computing, and we are seeing strong customer adoption here. And of course, changes in the cloud core design means changes to critical power configuration, and that’s what’s driving additional conversions.  It’s safe to say, cloud technical needs will change as applications evolve over time. We have a highly adaptable platform, operating at scale, so we continue to be well positioned to capture these opportunities. Now, switching gears a little bit, healthcare trends remain intact. Elective procedure demand is strong and hospital CapEx is steady. We’re experiencing some slowing in medical equipment related to life sciences, but this appears largely a result of normalization after an extended period of exceptionally strong demand for testing products from the pandemic. Now, looking at the automotive space, our EV and ADAS customer demand remained strong. Technology transitions are driven by important long-term trends, and we have built a business based on customer and geographic diversity. As our automotive business makes its way towards $4 billion in revenue, we’re adding value on multiple levels to drive deeper and higher valued engagements. Our next-gen mobility bookings continue to grow. That’s building on our momentum from record bookings from the last fiscal year. All of this comes from our proven design and engineering capabilities, our multi-disciplined technology expertise, and decades of experience with the unique demands of the automotive industry. Now, another important secular trend from which we’re all benefiting is the global renewable energy transition. We’re currently ramping both microinverter and EV fast charger production in the U.S., and these are just two examples of how well we are positioned to help enable the global shift to renewable energy. Last year, our renewables related hardware revenue was just over $1.2 billion within our $6.5 billion industrial business unit. We expect renewables to grow again this year with improving long-term prospects as the rules and benefits of the IRA are finalized and fully understood. Again, having a diversified portfolio from a product, customer and geographic perspective is an important attribute to managing through the cycles and delivering consistent results over time. We continue to believe the fundamentals of outsourced manufacturing are strong, and we remain very optimistic about our future. Our focus on providing a wide range of manufacturing capabilities and services, where our customers need them across the globe, is our competitive advantage. By leveraging our core capabilities and capitalizing on the long-term secular growth drivers, we will continue to drive value creation in the years to come. With that, I’ll turn it over to Paul to take you through our financials.\nPaul Lundstrom: Okay. Thank you, Revathi. I’ll begin with our first quarter performance on slide 7. First quarter revenue was $7.3 billion, flat year-over-year against a difficult comp and with some macro-related slowing. Revenue was down 2% sequentially, which is in line with typical seasonality. Gross profit totaled $614 million and gross margin came in at 8.4%. Operating profit was $377 million with operating margins at 5.1%, improving 60 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share came in at $0.57 for the quarter. That was up 6% and includes $0.06 of headwind from Nextracker non-controlling interest. Turning to our first quarter segment results on the next slide. Reliability revenue increased 11% to $3.3 billion. The growth was driven by continued momentum, with strong secular trends such as next gen mobility, renewables and cloud critical power. Operating income was a $165 million, up 12% and operating margin for this segment improved sequentially to 5%, as production volumes increased on ramping programs, and as we navigated labor inflation and lingering semiconductor disruptions. In Agility, revenue was $3.6 billion, down 10% as expected due to a combination of tough comps, continued weakness in consumer end markets and some softness in parts of enterprise IT. Operating income was a $146 million, down 14%, but focused execution and strong cost management helped maintain operating margins at 4.1%. Finally, Nextracker revenue came in at $480 million, up 21% year-over-year. Operating income at Nextracker was $82 million, more than double what it was last year, delivering a solid 17.2% operating margin. Moving to cash flow on slide 9. Inventory improvements continued into Q1 with total net inventory decreasing slightly in the quarter. We’re seeing signs of recovery. However, we continue to expect inventory will be slow to unwind. Q1 net CapEx totaled a $156 million, on target at 2% of revenue. We expect similar total investment levels for the full fiscal 2024, as we continue to invest in future growth as well as technologies such as advanced automation and machine learning solutions. These investments are important to drive continued optimization in Agility with increasingly complex products, and changing labor markets. Free cash flow was an outflow of $150 million, driven by the timing of our business, along with reductions in working capital advances and increased investments in CapEx. As previously indicated, we expect cash to be back half weighted to progressively improve through FY24 and we continue to expect free cash flow to be $600 million or more. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we bought back $197 million worth of stock in the quarter. On that note, I’ll quickly remind everyone that the Nextracker follow-on offering closed on July 3rd after our quarter end. So, while we received net proceeds of $495 million, it was not included in our final cash balance for this quarter. Although we continue to maintain a strong cash position, and as I mentioned last quarter, we have no intention of carrying this level of cash indefinitely. As we’ve consistently demonstrated over the last several years and we have and will continue to allocate capital in the best interest of our shareholders. Please turn to slide 10 for a segment outlook for the fiscal second quarter. For Reliability Solutions, we expect flat to up mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment and continued growth in our end markets, albeit at a more moderate pace. Revenue in Agility is expected to be down mid-single to low-double-digits with weakness in the consumer end markets affecting both lifestyle and consumer devices. CEC will be impacted by comms, infrastructure and enterprise IT spending adjustments ahead of our planned cloud ramps in the back half of the year. So far, the deceleration is consistent with our projections. Onto slide 11 for our quarterly guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion with adjusted operating income between $370 million and $400 million. Interest and other is estimated to be around $52 million. We expect the tax rate to be around 13% for the quarter. And all that translate to adjusted EPS between $0.55 and $0.60, based on approximately 453 million weighted average shares outstanding. This guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.06 to $0.07 of non-controlling interest expense resulting from the Nextracker IPO. Looking at our full year guidance on the following slide, we currently expect full year revenue between $30.5 billion and $31.5 billion with adjusted operating margin now between 5% and 5.2% and adjusted EPS between $2.35 and $2.55 a share. This includes the impact of approximately $0.23 to $0.26 in non-controlling interest expense, which is up $0.06 to $0.07 from our prior guidance, resulting from the Nextracker follow-on offering and our ownership going from 61% to 51%. Before we begin Q&A, I’d like to emphasize our conviction and our strategy in our portfolio. While the world faces continued macro and geopolitical uncertainty, our well-rounded and diversified portfolio and customer base significantly mitigates exposure. The inherent strength of our business gives us confidence and we continue to see solid momentum in the underlying drivers of our business. With that, I’ll turn it back to Jenny to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-answer portion of today’s call. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: …Margins reached the highest level in many years, at 5.1%. Nextracker, of course, is an important factor in that, given the strength that you reported there. But I think you also saw some sequential improvement in Reliability. Maybe you can help us understand a bit better how you think about margins by segment as the year progresses. I think pretty steady at these sorts of levels implied in guidance, but any puts and takes we should be considering by segment, as it relates to margins?\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes, Mark. So first, I’m glad you asked the question. Margins were much, much better sequentially and we were very happy to see that. Maybe just kind of take you through the different segments. So first of all, Nextracker, as you know, you look back a year ago, Q1 margins for Nextracker were their trough margins for that year, as they were still coming out of that, all that, repricing of backlog and getting through the logistics and steel challenges they had a couple years back. So their lapping an easy comp, but I’ll also say really strong execution from the Nextracker team in the quarter at north of 17% margin. So that was really, really good to see. You look at the other two segments sequentially, Agility, really good. Look, volume was down a little bit, but if you look at where volume came down within Agility, part of that was double-digit declines in the lifestyle business. As I think everyone knows, that tends to be the richer margin business unit within Agility. And so if I look at their decrementals on lower volume, I think they did a fantastic job managing that. So, thrilled to see that. And then if you look at Reliability, the Reliability story over the last six to nine months has been, doing what we can to accelerate a number of very important next gen programs. You saw 4% margins in Q3 and Q4 of last year, and a huge improvement in Reliability as we moved here into Q1. On $51 million of incremental sales, profit dropped through at 45%, which is very strong incremental margins. I can’t say enough about the execution of that team this quarter. Very happy to see it. \nMark Delaney: That’s helpful context. Thinking about the higher level opportunities that you spoke to, you mentioned some of the secular changes underway in areas such as electrification and AI. When you look at what Flex may need in order to properly address those opportunities over the next several years, how are you thinking about the Company’s capabilities? And would you consider using some of the cash on hand for M&A and maybe acquisitions akin to what you did with Anord Mardix and add in even some product type capabilities? Thanks.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. Mark, what I’d say is both electrification and AI as it relates to both cloud and CEC in our power business are both important to us. We have been investing in our electrification and our EV business in automotive for a while, and you have seen the results of it in the bookings that came in last year and how we are continuing to perform with the overall growth of the business this year. So, we feel really good in our investments there. We have made design investments that creates a platform opportunity for EV customers to use when they want to use our platform. So we can do that as a full design house or we can do that as a joint manufacturing with them if they want to give us their own design for us to contract manufacture. So electrification as a whole, we feel really good about our position there. Will there be opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions? I’d say there always is. At this time, our focus on the use of cash is really around buybacks, but we always look for nice technology add-ins if it’s possible. And then we would love if it came in as the returns that Anord did for us. But we don’t have significant gaps for electrification automotive portfolio to do really well. So we feel good about that. I’d say on AI, from the CEC perspective, the most important thing that customers are expecting from us, and we have a big platform ramp that’s happening in the second half of this year for a cloud customer. That is around this particular issue is that, you have to be able to scale fast. You have to have very complex, fully vertically integrated capability. And that’s what customers are looking for from the CEC side. And that Flex is very good at doing. From the power side, we have developed, on our embedded power products that’s in the industrial business, product that is very specific for GPU power needs. And those products are already launched with one customer, and we are looking to launch that with other customers that we have very strong growth potential. I don’t see a lot of acquisition needs there. But I’d say, yes, I mean, from a technology perspective, if there is any plug-in capability for both of these areas, we’ll look at it. But at this point, we do think our best use of cash will be in buybacks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Please ask your question.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on margins, compared to your guidance for 1Q, I mean, margins came in much better, especially in Reliability, and it looks like you are taking up the full year by 10 bps to 5.1%. But, the EPS guidance range remains the same. Is that all because of the higher non-controlling interest from Nextracker? And on the Agility side, on maybe $100 million lower revenues, your margins declined sequentially, like 400 or 500 bps -- sorry, 40, 50 bps. So, can you -- do we think that that will sustain at a lower level throughout the year because you are guiding lifestyle and consumer devices to be weaker?\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes. So good questions, Ruplu. I appreciate it. So first of all, just on your NCI comment and EPS. You are right. We took up the margin rate. Things looked really good in Q1. Like you said, it was an across the board. We did better in Agility, Reliability and Nextracker in terms of margin performance. So, that was very nice to see, and you heard my comments to Mark just on the sequentials. The NCI answer, absolutely, that you’re thinking about the right way. As you know, our stake went from 61% down to 51% and so there is a little bit more minority interest headwind or NCI headwind, and we called that out in the prepared remarks. So you’re right. That’s how to think about it. In terms of Agility decrementals, here’s what I would say. Sequentially for Agility, they had soft revenue. It was for the things that we had sort of been telegraphing to everyone over the last couple of quarters, softer consumer end markets. But on 10% lower revenue, they are -- decremental margins were only about 17%, which is pretty good considering where we’re seeing the volume declines. It’s in the lifestyle segment and in consumer devices, lifestyle of the three business units within Agility that tends to be the better margin business. And so when you have top line pressure, it does convert. That said, really strong execution by the team to sort of mitigate the softer volume. And it was things like cost reduction and pulling all the levers we need to pull to continue to have strong margins. And I was thrilled to see margins still north of 4% in the quarter, despite the lower volumes.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. And at a time like this when there’s so much instability in terms of how end markets are moving, it’s really good to see margin performance like this. And we’ve always talked about how Agility performs in a down market. And so this is fantastic to see how well they’re performing from a margin standpoint in a time like this. So, we feel good about the year. We’re still in the first quarter, our fiscal Q1. So, it’s a good time to hold full year the way we think it is. I think it’s a prudent thing to do, but feel good overall in terms of where margins have come in.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Let me ask you a follow-on question on ROIC, return on invested capital. What do you target, what’s your target range for that metric? Looks like over the last couple of quarters it’s been trending in the 20%, like low-20% including goodwill. And how do you see that trending over the next couple of quarters or years? I mean, what are some of the things that you can do to potentially improve that? Thanks.\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes. We target north of 20%. And ROIC is one of those funny things. If you target 40%, you’re leaving investments on the table that could be accretive to our overall investors. And so, I would rather not hard peg a number, but rather just say, our job is to maintain solid ROIC so that all of our investors benefit. And that would be certainly north of 20%.\nOperator: The next one is from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess, if I can start with one really on the revenue side here, in certain end markets that you are seeing a bit more headwind like consumer. I know you said, they’re tracking largely in line with what you expect, even on the enterprise side. But if I look at sort of relative to where consensus was, it looks like you’re sort of expecting a more backend loaded year than where consensus was. And I’m just curious, like when you think about a bit more of a backend loaded year, is that really driven by the visibility you have in maybe the engagement with the cloud customer that you talked about, or are there any other sort of segments you would call out where there’s a bit more activity in the back half that where maybe consensus isn’t appreciating in relation to how you get to that full year number? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. Samik, I’ll start and then Paul will probably have something to add. First is I think it’s pretty usual for us to have second half revenue be higher than the first half. So that’s pretty common for us. And then fiscal ‘23 was definitely an unusual year, right? It was very strong first half. So, the comps improved in the back half of the year. I would say that if you look at fiscal ‘22, second half was up 7% over the first half. And so, we have had similar trends before that you see. And so, we expect more normalization I would say this year than what we saw last year. And then, if you look at the second half, what I feel really good about is what’s driving the volume increase for us is our expectation in some new bookings that we have in cloud and power that will drive the second half acceleration. Reliability already has a strong first half, will have a strong second half. And also we don’t anticipate much improvement in the consumer markets. and so we’ll lapse some difficult comps. So I’d say overall, it makes sense for us to think the year will pan out the way we have. And then plus we’re trying to forecast in a very dynamic macro environment. We’re usually very prudent in our end market forecast and have been fairly accurate in the last five years in terms -- even with such a dynamic environment. And then lastly, I would say, very importantly is that volumes move around, but we are also very confident in our EPS target. So, I don’t know, Paul, if you’ll add anything to that.\nPaul Lundstrom: No. That’s clear, other than to say, welcome, Samik. Nice to hear from you.\nSamik Chatterjee: No, thank you. And maybe just for my follow-up, you talked about the opportunity with these cloud customers on AI related engagements. I’m more curious if you see an opportunity to maybe take the margin profile a bit higher on these AI engagements related to the sort of traditional run rate business that you have with them. How does the competitive landscape look or what do you even sort of, what are the sort of decision making points that you’re putting up with them? And is there an opportunity to sort of get a premium in some relation to drive a higher margin mix on that? Thank you.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. I’d say, Samik, what Flex has done consistently over the last five years in almost all end markets that we participate in, is really focused on working with customers where we can provide right solutions that move our margin profile up. And you’ve seen that play out in the last five years. With AI, like I said, in my comments in the beginning, what’s really important is how quickly can you scale? Are you capable of handling complex products? And we are talking scale, we’re talking about significant scale in a short amount of time. Are you capable of complexity of products like this? Can you brainstorm with the customer in terms of making improvements to their product, because a lot of it is new product going into the market. So from the CEC side, those are the main things that customers are looking for is a partner who will be very consistent, has high technology capability, and we do command a price premium for those kinds of things. So that definitely helps in terms of our overall mix and margin. And then on the embedded power side, on the industrial side, those are the designs that we own. We command a premium on those products. There’s not many suppliers out there who are capable of developing that. And we are with some very premier customers already with our products that we’ve been qualifying for the last year. And those will come in at a very significant premium to our base products. So, I would say, yes, I mean, we have shown consistently that we participate in end markets only if we like the margin profile, we don’t go for the next shiny bicycle. So, I would say, AI would be the same thing, and we feel quite confident that it’ll meet the margin profiles we’re looking for.\nPaul Lundstrom: No bicycles.\nRevathi Advaithi: No bicycles.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks and good afternoon. Question Paul on your comments around inventory which continues to be fairly bloated, revenue -- I mean on a dollar basis, certainly, and a day’s basis. You talked about that unwind being relatively slow. Is that because there’s still some hard to get parts and still elevated lead times, are customers asking you to keep inventory on hand? How do we think about this playing out over the next few quarters?\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes. I mean, I don’t love the word bloated, but inventory will be will be gradual to unwind. I think we have been carrying levels of inventory that we have needed to just support -- to support our end customers. And in many cases, you look back, 18 months ago, our customers wanted to carry more buffer stock, and with the plan that be sort of short-term, and I think short-term sort of blended into medium-term. But expectation continues that inventory will unwind. If you look sort of the dynamics of free cash flow, as you know, we have had significant support over the last year or two from working capital advances, that’s customers basically giving cash to carry those higher inventory levels. And so what’s going to happen here over the next several quarters is, you will see inventory levels gradually come down. You will also see working capital advance levels gradually come down. So, those two opposite sides of the balance sheet items will slowly start to pull back. And what I think will happen is because we are carrying more inventory than we are advances, over time, you will see cash flow improve. As I look to the full year, no change on our cash outlook. We still feel confident in the $600 million plus of free cash generation. No change there. I would say, everything is at least at the moment kind of surprise free.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then just as my follow-up, just regarding Nextracker, and the remaining 51% stake that you have in that. What should we think about the exit strategy and how that plays out?\nRevathi Advaithi: Matt, we have been very consistent in what we have said about Nextracker, and we have followed through. You can see that with the last event that took place with our follow-on. And I would say, we have always said Nextracker will do better as a standalone company, and we will continue to execute in that direction. So no change on that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Please ask your question.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions if I could. First of all, Paul, you mentioned the 45% incremental margins on the Reliability business. Can you break that down a little bit further, give us what’s normal versus maybe what was a little more episodic? And then I had a follow-up.\nPaul Lundstrom: Sure. So Reliability, I mean, here’s the quick math. Sales were up 51%. Profit was up 20% -- excuse me, 51%. I wish. Sales were up $51 million, operating profit was up 23%. So, that’s the 45% drop that I referred to. So Q3 and Q4 were tough. We made a lot of investments in that Reliability business as we were preparing to accelerate a number of these next generation program ramps. And that meant we had some stranded resources. We had some stranded labor. We were hiring sort of ahead of the curve. And so, as volume comes and all those resources become fully utilized, it just has a huge effect on your incrementals. So, I think that was a lot of it. And I would say, it was essentially across the board. We are ramping in the industrial business for a number of Reliability -- excuse me, renewable energy programs. We got a bunch of stuff going on in automotive right now. They did much better sequentially as well. The health solutions business was up quarter-over-quarter. So, I would say across the board, business by business strong performance and much better than what we saw in the back half of last year.\nSteven Fox: And then just during the CapEx commentary, you mentioned investments, I assume this is internal investments in automation and AI or machine learning. Can you just talk about how you’re making decisions on where to invest there? Are those customer sponsored? Are those things that are just meant to generally expand your capabilities? How do we think about what kind of return you get on those investments? Thank you.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. I would say it’s a mix of both. We’re definitely making investments in factory automation, machine learning related to improving our factory automation or our planning processes or things like that. So, definitely making investments on that. I think, whether you think about kind of improving your quality inspection capability as an example, right? And that helps a customer improve their overall quality performance, but also helps flex from a productivity standpoint. So, there are many examples like that where you will use to deploy a machine vision capability that can self-learn and correct itself with time. So, these kinds of things would either be funded by us or funded by the customer to drive productivity and better quality performance. So, I’d say some of the investments are for us, some of the investments are customer driven, but also from a product design perspective, those mainly come in our power business. That’s an industrial, that’s more for the generative AI space. But most of it is for kind of factory automation, I would say deployments is what we’re driving and our belief is that it drives productivity for the business.\nOperator: And your last question is from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: Revathi, I was wondering if you could talk about within industrial, I saw you recently announced the opening of the facility with Enphase in Columbia, South Carolina, and that was pointed to as in terms of being at least somewhat funded or supported by the IRA. So, I’m just wondering how you’re thinking about some of this government stimulus money that’s coming through and how we’ll see it, sort of manifest itself within Flex’s results over the next couple of years? And then, I have a follow up. Thanks.\nRevathi Advaithi: Yes. I would say from IRA perspective, that looks at driving growth in the U.S. for renewables energy. For us, the biggest impact Shannon will be growth that is funded by our customers. That is mainly focused on U.S. manufacturing. So Enphase is a classic example of that. But we’re quickly seeing customers pivot to U.S. manufacturing capability to take advantage of things like IRA. I would say from a margin standpoint, how that helps in the long run and how those incentives really play out, I think there’s still work to be done there. But the view is that there’s a growth opportunity for our customers and us that we all should be really taking advantage of Enphase and other customers in the inverter space that we are ramping up for all fit into that environment. So, we do see overall growth in our U.S. manufacturing as it results to IRA or infrastructure and you’ve seen several announcements related to that.\nShannon Cross: Great. And then Paul, maybe if we could talk a little bit about cash, cash balance, share purchase timing, you bought back $197 million of stock last quarter. How should we think about the pace of share repurchase? How are you thinking about that? And what do you think your sort of cash balance is that you need to run the business? I understand free cash flow is more backend loaded this year, but I think you had some excess cash coming into this -- the Nextracker sale and then obviously, you’ve got those proceeds and then you’re going to generate cash. So, just wondering how you’re thinking about it in terms of return to shareholders? Thank you.\nPaul Lundstrom: Yes. So, we were pleased to be able to step up repo in the first quarter compared to what we did in Q4. Q4 was a sort of challenge because of the -- we’re locked up because of Nextracker and really couldn’t trade. And so getting 200 million or so done in the first quarter, by the way, at an average price in the 22 something or other 22 plus, really happy with that. That’s great for shareholders. Just looking at our valuation and you kind of do the sum of the parts and giving full credit for Nextracker. It does seem that, core Flex is undervalued relative to EMS. And so, as long as we see disconnects like that, we think it makes sense to be in the market. Not going to give like a hard peg number on what specifically we’re going to do here in Q2, but I will say we’re going to continue to be in the market. And you ask a good question, Shannon, on cash and what’s sort of necessary. I would say if you looked several years ago, the peak, the trough cash use would say, maybe you need $1.5 billion. That’s probably up a little bit, over the last few years, given things like, inventory and just other challenging supply chain situations. But if you think about where we ended Q1, which excludes $500 million from the follow-on, so take 2.6, 2.7 plus another 500 million, we’re well north of $3 billion. We have excess cash. And as Revathi pointed out maybe 20 minutes ago, our number one priority is share repo right now. We think it’s accretive to the investors and makes good sense as a capital allocation option. \nOperator: Thank you. No more questions at this time. Please continue, sir.\nRevathi Advaithi: Okay. Thank you. And on behalf of the entire Flex leadership team, I want to give a sincere thank you to all our customers for their trust and partnership, and of course, to our shareholders for your continued support. And then, I want to thank our Flex team across the globe for their hard work and dedication. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference."
