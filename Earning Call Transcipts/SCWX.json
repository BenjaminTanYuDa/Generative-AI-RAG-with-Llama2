Our Taegis business continued its strong momentum in fiscal 2024. Taegis revenue grew 41% year-over-year with full year revenue reaching 265 million. Taegis annual recurring revenue or ARR now stands at 285 million representing 9% growth over last year. We are well on track for completing our business transformation with Taegis ARR reaching 96% of our total ARR at year-end. Today we are less than 60 days away from a significant positive milestone. The end of life of our non-strategic lines of business and our Q4 attainment of positive EBITDA was another major milestone as we over delivered against our plans on our path to profitability.  I am energized by what we are accomplishing with progress in several areas this past quarter. We have continued the expansion and growing the impact of our partner eco system, growing Taegis average revenue per customer, leading peers by more than 60% on average, advanced our industry leading platform with features and capabilities most valued by customers and partners. And further expanded our margins through cost optimization efforts, leveraging our uniquely scalable cloud architecture and many years of development in automation and AI capabilities. Importantly, our unique open XDR-based approach to driving superior security outcomes is increasingly receiving accolades by the market. This quarter, we were recognized by Frost & Sullivan with a Competitive Strategy Leadership Award in the global XDR industry, a testament to our strategy effectiveness and execution, competitive differentiation, and exceptional SecOps experience for our customers and partners.  The product landscape evolution is accelerating. Last year, average threat actor dwell times fell below 24 hours from four and a half days in 2022. And the pace of technological advancement, which creates opportunity for businesses to grow also makes it challenging for them to outpace the adversary on their own. While ransomware attacks remain the primary threat facing organizations, we are now witnessing the early impacts of AI on threat vectors via deep fakes and increasingly savvy phishing attacks. This means that our AI powered Taegis detection and response platform is more relevant than ever for customers. And our Taegis XDR platform is unique. It was built from day one to be open without compromise and we designed it that way for several reasons.  First, superior threat detection and response. Taegisâ€™ seamless integration with a wide range of technologies and systems stands as a critical advantage, ensuring a cohesive and unified security posture across diverse IT environments. We also see customers with an assortment of security controls, and many of these take time to replace securely. So interoperability is a key to comprehensive and continuously effective threat detection. But detection is insufficient without broad automated response capabilities. Not only does Taegis provide native automated investigation and response playbooks that work in concert across our integrations, but also over 70% of our customers and partners have developed their own playbooks to adapt Taegis automated response actions to their environments. As a result, we see over 6,000 configured playbooks running across all Taegis tenants, thwarting millions of threats in real time.  Second, security at the pace of business. Great security shouldn't hamper the choices organizations make in their next-gen technology investments and architecture design. Taegis is designed to ensure that our customers have a choice, that their security posture can evolve effortlessly with their changing technology investments essential for maintaining an effective defense for any environment. In fact, we recently won a deal with a large transportation agency that chose Taegis to displace an MDR provider as they came up for renewal. Our open approach was an important differentiator, given our platform's ability to bi-directionally integrate and work within not only their existing technology ecosystem, but also with their technology roadmap vision. This customer was impressed by the greater visibility Taegis XDR provides, with the ability to see alerts with context, and to query data directly in a way that their MDR vendor could not, while having live chat access to a security expert when needed. And proactive threat hunting capabilities meant that they could go on the offensive. This customer chose Taegis for its ability to deploy quickly within their existing ecosystem for a more scalable detection and response answer at a compelling predictable cost of ownership.  Third, customer choice. We know for many organizations they operate with mixed security control and sensor environments and we anticipate that they will continue to do so into the future as they experiment and adapt to changing needs. Taegis uniquely gives customers optionality to do so securely. We are unique in taking an open endpoint approach with single agent capability, which allows us to integrate XDR and MDR seamlessly for customers deploying vendors with the majority of the endpoint market, providing the speed and breadth of security coverage they need. Our supportive choice means that customers can work within their own time constraints around their technology evolution with optionality to evolve their security controls, to save vendor spend and management costs at a compelling per endpoint pricing model that has no surprise variable data charges.  As an example, we recently deepened our relationship with a large healthcare company based in Australia. We had deployed Taegis with the parent company, which was able to observe the side-by-side comparison of cost and operational burdens of their subsidiary SIEM Solutions versus our Taegis platform. With the overall value and efficiencies the parent company gained from Taegis, they chose our open platform to display both their MDR provider and SIEM that were forcing them to rationalize the data they were ingesting to keep costs down. We were able to save the team time spent on maintaining customizations of their SIEM, provide 12 months of data standard, and eliminate the high cost of data charges with predictable spend for them. In sum, we continue to meet the needs of customers seeking the best combination of controls to maximize security value and their return on investment across endpoint, network, identity, and cloud. Better outcomes with a sticky yet flexible platform positions us to capture growing demand well into the future.  Since the very beginning, Taegis has leveraged AI to drive automation and efficiency through every aspect of the platform. We combine the best of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to detect malicious activity that may be missed by signatures, prioritize the threats that matter, automate routine investigations, and respond in near real-time to any advancements made by the adversary. Our competitive advantage in this area is driven by the volume and variety of data we ingest. Combined with the intuition we get from our expert security analysts, that enables the platform to constantly learn and adapt to the adversary. With more than 700 billion security events per day and thousands of real-world SoC investigations conducted every month, Taegis demonstrably protects our customers more effectively than our competitors.  AI is key to enabling Taegis to scale the security talent required to manage detection and response for organizations of all sizes. A few examples of Taegis' AI in practice include our patent pending hands-on keyboard detector that's finding threat actors living off the land even when zero days are used as the initial access vector. Our patent pending alert prioritization system that increased the triage productivity for SecOps analysts using Taegis by over 100% last year. Building on these capabilities, we launched our AI-powered Threat score last quarter, which leverages our alert prioritization system to further reduce alert noise while more rapidly and accurately surfacing critical threats, leading to better security outcomes for our customers and efficiency gains for all. We're also using large language models to help SecOps become even more efficient, automating initial investigation summaries, improving detection logic and decision making, and rapidly normalizing third-party alerts that may be new to the system. Today, approximately half of all Taegis investigations are automated and this is only the beginning. We are continuing to invest in new capabilities through both add-on and native security products to deliver additional value to our customers and give us the opportunity to expand our share of wallet. I'll turn now to our go-to-market progress. We accelerated the expansion of our partner ecosystem over the last year, broadening our reach and addressable market. We now work with more than 400 partners across tech alliances, solution providers, managed services providers, and cyber insurers, including leading providers in each category and we remain committed to supporting and expanding these partnerships globally. For example, we continue to advance our global MSSP partner program in Q4 with the addition of a forward-thinking multinational MSSP headquartered in India. This partner provides services for some of the world's most recognizable brands and saw the need to improve security for their customers and deliver better results for their business by shifting to Taegis from their existing SIEM.  In fourth quarter, we also saw improving levels of sales productivity with our Better Together go-to-market motion. Partner created opportunities were up 20% in Q4 and our partner win rate and sales contribution per partner was up sequentially each of the last four quarters. Our partners are winning more, growing faster and registering more opportunities with us based on the value they see Taegis and our partner programs bringing to their customers. In the fourth quarter, around 90% of global Taegis new logo business was closed with a partner, more than double the prior year period. And the market is recognizing our successful shift to a partner-first approach over the last year. We were recently named to CRN Security 100, recognizing our commitment and work with our partners to protect businesses from cyber threats.  One great example of the success of a great combined win, both for the customer and one of our technology alliance partners is a deal we closed this quarter with a large European law firm. During the proof of value, we were able to quickly demonstrate the increased value to the customer of our combined solution through the power of Taegis cross correlating detections efficiently across all of their data. As a result, they quickly saw fewer but higher fidelity critical alerts. And because of that noise reduction, their team knew they could focus more time elsewhere, advancing their overall security posture and program. Before I shift gears and discuss our drive to profitability, I would like to provide some market context. Demand for our open XDR platform solution remains strong and cybersecurity remains a top priority for C-suite executives. In our conversations with prospects, they see the opportunity for Taegis to scale their spend on both security technology and talent and to reduce the number of security vendors that they manage, while delivering an improved security risk posture and outcomes for their organization. In terms of buyer behavior, we have yet to see any material changes that would indicate a significant change in behavior in the year ahead. It remains an environment with a rational focus on fiscal responsibility with customers continuing to follow more layers of deal review and higher level of approvals in the decision-making process. However, we have not seen any need for changes in pricing or discounting to win deals.  Alpana will discuss our Q4 results and fiscal 2025 outlook in a moment, but it is important for me to recognize the progress on profitability, achieving positive EBITDA in Q4. This is a testament to the hard work of our teammates, growing our Taegis business while completing the transformation of our business model and actively streamlining our cost structure. We are delivering and remain committed to driving sustained growth while improving the scale, productivity and operational efficiencies of our business. As we look to fiscal 2025, I'm excited about the opportunity ahead of us. As I noted earlier, Q1 of fiscal 2025 will mark the sunset of our other MSS business. We announced its end of life just over two years ago, and we have delivered on our committed time frame. This major milestone will alleviate the remaining transformation headwind on our total revenue and EBITDA. We delivered on and are committed to further Taegis gross margin expansion, which we drive in primarily two ways. First, through continued optimization of our cloud architecture while supporting the best customer security outcomes. We carefully consider how we transport, process and store data throughout our platform, with a cost-effective approach to data access speed and resilience. Our engineering team delivers 12 months of data storage for customers standard against competitors who average one month. Yet, we've driven cloud cost per endpoint down nearly 20% over the last two years. Two, our margins also reflect our use of AI and automation to scale MDR delivery. While our Taegis revenue grew double digit last year and customer satisfaction and NPS scores increased year-over-year as well, our spend on SecOps remained flat. In conclusion, demand for our open platform remains strong. We have and will continue to invest in innovations for our Taegis XDR solution to meet the security needs of our customers and partners providing security outcomes at a fully predictable and compelling total cost of ownership. We remain confident that our open without compromise approach, ongoing investments in Taegis, and our growing successful partnerships will ensure Taegis as a platform of choice for organizations to bolster their security posture now and in the years ahead, setting the foundation that will drive our growth. I want to thank our customers and partners for joining forces with us and I deeply appreciate our teammates for their diligence, integrity, and commitment to securing our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Alpana to walk through our financial results and guidance.\nAlpana Wegner: Thanks, Wendy. Good morning, everyone. I will review our Q4 and full year results for the fiscal year 2024 before I provide expectations for fiscal year 2025. We delivered Q4 total revenue of $89.2 million, above our guidance range of $86 million to $88 million, primarily due to new deals closing earlier in the quarter and professional services revenue. Total revenue continued to be impacted by the wind-down of our nonstrategic legacy business, which contributed to 27 points of the decline year-over-year.  Taegis subscription revenue was $68.9 million, up 15% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially, in line with our expectations. Taegis ARR increased 9% year-over-year to $284.9 million, slightly higher than expectations, we saw a handful of deals pulled forward into the quarter. Average revenue per Taegis customer expanded sequentially to $145,000 driven by higher new logo ARPC and continued expansion of spend by our existing customers. Taegis ARPC remains a premium to both the industry average and to our legacy other MSS average, underscoring the value that Taegis provides our customers. We ended the quarter with 2,000 Taegis customers. While we see an increase in large new customers reflected in our ARPC, the customer count also reflects the decline in smaller network-only customers with ARPC of less than $15,000. As our Taegis pricing is largely on a per-endpoint basis, grouping [ph] endpoint is another indicator of platform expansion. Our endpoint count grew 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 operating results were strong, reflecting our focus on operational efficiency, productivity improvements, and cost discipline. Q4 non-GAAP Taegis gross margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially to 73.1% and showed an improvement of 390 basis points versus fourth quarter a year ago, demonstrating the scale and opportunity within the Taegis business, driven by our unique cloud architecture and investments in automation, AI and machine learning. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 million, exceeding our guidance of breakeven and improving $23.5 million from Q4 of the prior year.  To recap our full year 2024 results, Taegis revenue grew 41% year-over-year to $265 million and in line with our expectations. Taegis non-GAAP gross margins expanded 380 basis points to 71.7%. The progressive expansion through fiscal year 2024 underscores the scalability of our platform. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $28 million, improving year-over-year from a loss of $59 million, expanding EBITDA margins 500 basis points as we balance the topline headwind from exiting our nonstrategic business and managing our cost structure to increase operating leverage. Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended Q4 with a strong balance sheet, with $69 million in cash, no debt and an undrawn $50 million credit facility. Cash flow from operations was $11 million in the quarter compared with $9 million in the prior year period, reflecting our improved adjusted EBITDA.  Now turning to our fiscal year 2025 guidance. I'll share some color on what is shaping our full year outlook. First, as Wendy commented, we expect a stable macro-economic backdrop consistent with the past few quarters in the year ahead. Second, this year's cohort of Taegis customers that are renewing is the largest we've seen since the launch of Taegis. While we continue to see positive trends in our already strong customer satisfaction force, we have taken a measured approach to our renewal assumption to reflect the current spending caution organizations they're taking. And third, in terms of our nonstrategic business, we expect other MSS ARR will be zero by the end of the first quarter. We will see a return to sequential quarter-over-quarter total revenue growth in the second half of the year, and the redundant costs related to the nonstrategic business of $4 million to $6 million on an annualized basis will be eliminated in the second half of fiscal 2025.  To help with modeling, we expect operating leverage to be more weighted to the second half of the year, driven primarily by the timing of redundant cost elimination. For the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect total ARR to be $300 million or greater, total revenue of $325 million to $335 million, total gross margins to be 68%, inclusive of Taegis gross margins to be 74%, adjusted EBITDA to be between $4 million and $12 million, non-GAAP EPS to be between breakeven and $0.08, cash flow from operations to be between cash use of $2 million and cash generated of $8 million, and we expect CAPEX to be in line with fiscal year 2024. For Q1 fiscal 2025, we expect total revenue of $83 million to $85 million, adjusted EBITDA to be between breakeven to $2 million; non-GAAP EPS to be between a loss of $0.01 and income of $0.01. Our outlook for Q1 EBITDA also reflects seasonal timing of spend related to benefits and marketing program activities. We expect cash flow to trend lower in Q1, driven by a concentration of cash payments early in the year. In closing, we remain confident in the ability to drive profitability and sustainable growth based on the continued scale opportunity driven by our unique cloud architecture, the delivery of differentiated and better security outcomes for our customers on our open Taegis platform, and the progress we've made in building a strong partner ecosystem. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Wendy will now rejoin us as we begin Q&A. Operator, can you please introduce the first question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions here, how are you? \nWendy Thomas: Good morning. \nSaket Kalia: Good morning. Hey, thanks Wendy. Maybe I'll start with you, Wendy for my first question. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about just the competitive backdrop in the SIEM market. It just feels like there's a decent bit of disruption happening there. How much of the SaaS business here do you think is sort of exposed to that trend and what are you sort of seeing out there as you spend time with customers?\nWendy Thomas: Sure. That time is here. Legacy and Next Gen sense for that matter, haven't ever looked up to the promise because data collection doesn't equate to security efficacy. And they're really just aggregators of data. It's very difficult to maintain those in order to detect high fidelity alerts and they certainly aren't built up for the kind of automated response that Taegis XDR is given the dwell-time that we see, which absolutely requires automation in that process. So from our seat, we view that as a tailwind. Vendor consolidation generally is a tailwind, but SIEMs, I think their time is here in terms of customer requirements and that replacement of that technology is certainly one of the areas where we win a lot of deals not just with solution provider partners, but we increasingly see that with MSSPs who have been running a business where there's still a lot of margin opportunity to move to Taegis XDR in terms of their ability to deliver services at scale, but also just get better results with their customers in terms of security. So we view that as a good tailwind for us.\nSaket Kalia: Yes, absolutely. Alpana, maybe for you for my follow-up, it's great to see the transition away from sort of the nonstrategic businesses really come to completion, I think, here in the next quarter or so. I think you answered part of my question, which was, I think the $4 million to $6 million in annual cost that's going to be eliminated, but I just wanted to make sure, is there anything left, right, like -- and particularly, maybe why I asked that question is just the gross margin. I think the gross margin -- the total gross margin will still be below where we will be for Taegis. So can you just walk us through kind of after that sunset happens, what sort of left on the cost side of the equation, does that make sense?\nAlpana Wegner: It does. And good morning. Yes, happy to share a little bit about. Once we get past the legacy business transition, our focus from a margin perspective is really around Taegis, which we shared, we're continuing to see opportunity there for continued progressive improvement in gross margins. That's primarily coming from our ongoing focus on AI and automation. We see a lot of opportunity in terms of continuing to be able to deliver high-quality SecOps MDR services but doing it with AI and automation that is helping us get greater leverage there.  And then the second place from a Taegis standpoint would be really our cloud architecture has enabled us to be able to have an effective and cost-effective way in which we transport, process, store data. And so we see continued opportunity there. Those things sometimes take a little time to be able to get the full magnitude but we, in our guidance, taking into consideration what we think is realistic in terms of realization in the current year. The other component of gross margins that you're seeing is also the -- what I would consider the strategic value-add portion of our services business. So we continue to see opportunities, particularly as it relates to strategic consulting, but that will hold a lower margin than what we see from Taegis. So on a mix basis, we've provided the guide on the overall gross margin.\nSaket Kalia: Super helpful. Thanks a lot guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cikos: Hey, thanks for getting me on guys. I just had two questions for you. I guess the first, if I could just frame the ARR here and how I'm looking at things and please provide some color. But I know that you guys are citing some deals that were pulled forward. And I just want to get a better sense like if I go back a quarter ago, you guys had been -- had taken down the guidance from $285 million plus to $280 million plus. Here we are a quarter later, and we did $285 million. So that delta, if I think about the outperformance ARR this quarter of $5 million, is that really explaining the pull-forward deals or is there anything more to consider there?\nAlpana Wegner: Hey good morning Mike, this is Alpana. Thanks for the question. There were -- I would say it was a mix. We certainly had a little bit of pull forward of deals. We also had as Wendy I think mentioned, we saw a good amount of momentum with some larger-sized deals closing in the quarter. It helped our ARPC, as we mentioned in our comments. We saw a nice increase there sequentially from 139,000 to 145,000. And so I would think the combination of both. We saw a little bit of pull forward activity, and we saw a little bit more of just positive momentum in the fourth quarter.\nMichael Cikos: Thank you. Thank you for that Alpana. And I guess a follow-up, it's probably full on you. Sorry, Wendy. Just on the financials again. I know in the prepared remarks, again, you were trying to frame or give us some parameters for the guidance, which I really do appreciate. I think one of the things that kind of struck me and I'm hoping you can kind of tease it out a bit. But with respect to the renewal cohort for Taegis, I think the direct line was you guys are taking a measured approach to renewals. Can you help parse through that, are we expecting any impact whether it's gross retention or net retention, like how should we consider that comment in the context of the guidance that we have today?\nAlpana Wegner: Yes, yes. And I'll let Wendy weigh in here, too. She might have a little bit of color to add. But just from a guidance perspective, what we try to do is make sure that we took into consideration what we're seeing from the broader macro environment. We continue to see deal cycle times being stable. We continue to see what I would consider kind of stabilization, but the continued scrutiny around deals, the additional layers of approvals, and just overall a bit of cautionary spend behavior. And so when we thought about the guide in particular around the renewal pool, we took that into consideration as well as on balance and the use of the term measure as we were just trying to be really balanced about. We do have a large amount of renewals coming up this year. That's a function of as you look into our history, you will see, we had some in late fiscal year 2022 and going into fiscal year 2023, we had a significant ramp of new customer acquisition. As those deals are now coming up for renewal, it's creating a larger renewal pool. And just being considerate of the macro environment, I wanted to make sure we put that on balance with what I would say is a strong, we view it to be a strong customer satisfaction and performance that we get from our things like CSAT and NPS. And so we're just being balanced between the two in thinking about our guide.\nWendy Thomas: Yes, I'll just add a little color to that in terms of we do look ahead in terms of customer health scores and SAT scores and NPS and those things, and those continue to be the highest they've been in Q4. So that's a good leading indicator for us. And we still see the demand for the platform and the customer usage on that platform as indicators of how important it is to the security of their organizations. But we are just going into the year ahead with a measured approach looking out for the full year given a big base up for renewal for some of the first time in this journey with Taegis and this, I am just being measured about that.\nMichael Cikos: Terrific, thank you very much guys. I will turn it over to my colleagues. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with Wendy, you mentioned how the spending environment has been more or less stable. At the same time, I think customers are looking for more value from their security spend. So maybe just walk us through how SecureWorks is helping deliver good security outcomes, but also driving ROI?\nWendy Thomas: Absolutely. There's a couple of ways that we see ourselves as unique in that approach. And I'll kind of do two sides of the coin. The first side of the coin is that we have a unique approach to pricing that's very transparent, that we have always had fixed end point pricing even though we are securing, protecting and responding across all telemetry types from business systems, from email to [indiscernible] to end point, kind of the whole spectrum. So that pricing is easily comparable in terms of the incremental value that you get. It also doesn't have any variable data charges despite the fact that we stored 12 months of data versus most competitors 30 days, again, tremendous security value in terms of detection capabilities, proactive hunting capabilities because of the way we treat our data, but that pricing incense customers to share that data for better security outcomes. So that pricing remains a strategic advantage and that could not be possible without the cloud architecture that we've built. On the other side, you have to show the value, the security value to customers. So we have spent good deal of this development in terms of the platform itself, being able to show customers in our quarterly security posture reviews, the efficacy of both the detections and response that we've done for them, the times, etcetera. But in comparison to benchmark them against peers in their industry so that they can also translate the value of security to their C Suite, their Board, etcetera, in terms of their risk posture, with the vulnerability perspective as well as the actual protection from detection and response. And we build that into an account management relationship that we've increasingly invested in, especially with larger customers to be able to translate that into evolving constantly with their technology roadmap. Their business priority is perhaps for acquisitions and integration to just make sure that they see that seamless continuation of security value over time because we know we win this business every single day.\nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for Alpana. You've been at SecureWorks now for a few quarters. You just gave a guidance for fiscal 2025. I'm curious just to understand your guidance philosophy here. Can you walk us through a little bit more on how you're being conservative, particularly around the renewal assumptions new business, just to give us a sense of whether or not this guidance is more or less derisked as you continue through the last phase of this transition? Thank you. \nAlpana Wegner: Yes. Thank you for the question. And you're right. This is the first annual guide that I'm setting with the company. And Wendy and I certainly partner on it and think both about what we see as the leading indicators within the business as well as the macro and what we do have visibility and predictability into as we've made the transition for our business to the SaaS and a highly subscription-oriented at least from a topline perspective. We've got a good amount of predictability. And from the amount that we don't have predictability into is really where we lean in and use judgment there. I do try and take a balanced approach taking -- weighing in what we have high confidence in versus where is the risk in our plan. And I would say that that's reflected in the guidance range that we've given. And I do also think that we continue to see the opportunity from a balanced approach between growth and profitability. We are very much focused on making sure we're investing appropriately from a growth perspective, both in product innovation as well as in our go-to-market strategy, but getting leverage in the business where we can, as you heard me talk about earlier, particularly around gross margins and even our operating costs, how we think about G&A, where we can get some additional opportunity there but also creating a positive EBITDA in transitioning the business to being how cash flow from operations that gives us -- to fund our own business. And so that is kind of the approach that I take from overall view of the business financially as well as from a guidance perspective. Hopefully that gives you a little bit of color without -- with me being like a new within the organization.\nHamza Fodderwala: It does, thank you. And nice results. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMadeline Brooks: Hi, it's Madeline on for Tal this morning. Just one question from us. Just going back to the renewal cohort. Are you more worried around growth turn or are you more worried around discounting and pricing pressure, I guess what's driving that conservative there, if you had to pick one of those to be more overweight than the other? Thank you. \nWendy Thomas: Sure. I can speak to kind of the broad pricing market, if that's helpful. As I mentioned, we do have a unique pricing strategy that I think is very predictable and compelling for customers and our approach to sort of holistic coverage is creating the best security outcomes is something you see on our higher average revenue per customer than our peers, in fact, quite significantly. What we don't see and have not done is make any changes to our discounting strategy or average discounts that we're giving and we see our partners continuing to grow pipeline with us and have higher win rates. So clearly, our pricing with them is providing them the economics that they're looking for. So despite there are sometimes occasional events in the market where competitors try to come in with cheaper free that never works on a sustained basis. So I have never been one to chase that kind of pricing. The fact is most organizations take the purchase of security pretty seriously relative to its potential impact to their business, if it's chosen poorly. So I just don't think that that's a winning approach and that's not been the case. For us, we're really just continuing to look at an environment of -- but I think, as I said, a really rational fiscal assessment of all spend across all vectors for most businesses these days. And so we just want to be measured about what may happen in the macro that we're not necessarily in control of as we look to that pool ahead.\nMadeline Brooks: Sorry, Wendy, I appreciate the comments on pricing in general. But I guess I'm just looking for where the conservative in the guidance is being driven around this renewal cohortâ€¦\nWendy Thomas: Yes, I'll let Alpana...\nMadeline Brooks: Okay, great, thank you. \nAlpana Wegner: Yes. Thanks, Madeline. Yes, and just piggybacking off of Wendy's comments there. I would say that it's not lost on us, the value of an existing customer over losing a customer. So our focus is going to be, and I would say we would prioritize retaining all of those customers that are in that renewal pool. And so for us, the risk that we thought through is more probably on the NRR side than I would say on the GRR side. And the reason I say that is we do have strong customer set. We do see that customers have positive feedback on the ROI that they're receiving from us. And in the current environment, if there are budgetary constraints that are driving cautionary spend or any of that type of behavior that would put pressure on those renewals, we will approach it in a partnership manner with our customers and our partners and be looking for the right long-term value, economic answer. That's a win-win for both organizations. And that typically manifest as you point out, through the NRR as opposed to a GRR.\nMadeline Brooks: Great, thank you so much. Thatâ€™s it for me. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. So Mr. Toomey, I'll turn the conference call back over to you.\nKevin Toomey: Great. Thank you. That wraps today's call. A replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations page at secureworks.com, along with our supplemental web deck and additional financial tables. Thank you all for joining us today.\nWendy Thomas: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."

We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Secureworks' CEO, Wendy Thomas.\nWendy Thomas: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to share that our Taegis business continued to yield industry-leading results in 3Q, with Taegis revenue expanding 41% year-over-year to over $67 million in the quarter. Taegis annual recurring revenue or ARR now stands at $279 million, a 25% growth over last year. In the context of this growth, we recently were recognized as having the largest market share of cloud-native XDR at 32% as published in the IDC Worldwide Cloud-Native XDR Marketshare report this quarter. And we are delivering on our drive to profitability, with a sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA, narrowing our loss to $1 million in 3Q with a clear path to breakeven next quarter. In the third quarter, we also advanced across several priorities. We accelerated expansion of our platform features and capabilities to provide superior security outcomes for customers and partners, added key partners to the Taegis ecosystem, broadening our reach and expanding our addressable market, and reinforced our market leadership role with new recognition in the marketplace for our platform and solutions. In fact, we are one of only two providers in the leader quadrant in the recent Forrester Wave: Managed Detection And Response Services In Europe. In short, we are building the foundation for long-term sustainable growth in our highly scalable Taegis business that is recognized by the market as a global leader in XDR. Why does that matter? It matters because XDR represents the next wave of security technology to address persistent security challenges unsolved by legacy SIMs, EDR-focused prevention or a services-based approach. Against the threat landscape that is constantly evolving, companies continue to grapple with the specter of ransomware attacks, data breaches and more. In our recent Annual Threat Intel Report, threat actor dwell times are down from nearly five days to just 24 hours over the last year. That is where the power of our Taegis solutions to prevent, detect and automate investigation and response comprehensively across the entire ecosystem, brings ongoing customer protection and value. Against this threat backdrop, companies are also looking to Secureworks to help them navigate growing privacy and cybersecurity compliance regulations and data provenance protections. We help them outpace growing cyber risk and manage against rising cyber insurance premiums. In the advanced AI and automation capabilities in Taegis, I mean, we scale the security talent required to effectively manage detection and response for organizations at scale. The competitive advantages that Taegis and the Secureworks suite of solutions offer are resonating in the market, demonstrably reducing risk and supporting resilience, driving demand for our solutions and increasing the market's recognition that XDR is the next era in security. I'll turn now to our go-to-market progress. As you know, our unique open without compromise approach to XDR creates multiple go-to-market channels for Secureworks and greater addressable market and revenue growth opportunities for our partners. This past quarter, we achieved several milestones in expanding our partner ecosystem and growing our deals one together. As an indicator of traction, in third quarter, more than 90% of global Taegis new logo business was closed with a partner, up from less than 40% this time a year ago. An example of the force multiplier when we partner with a solution provider is a competitive deal we recently won with a new customer and financial services. One of its portfolio companies experienced a cyber-attack that impacted business operations for an extended period, causing damaging effects both reputationally and financially with a small centralized security team and multiple solutions deployed across its portfolio of companies. They were looking for holistic visibility and consistent protection across a diverse and siloed technology footprint The customer cited two keys to their decision, our partner's consultative services and ability to provide customized billing across their portfolio and our open XDR approach to securing diverse technology stacks in a unified multi-tenant approach. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, we're encouraged by our conversations with prospects who see the opportunity with Taegis to scale their spend on both security technology and talent and to reduce the number of security vendors that they manage while delivering an improved security risk posture and outcomes for their business. For example, we recently signed a new customer, a large healthcare provider. They wanted to replace their legacy SIM as their small security team, didn't have the time or expertise to continually manage and optimize it for their security coverage. We won this customer after we were able to show we had advanced detection and automated response capabilities, inclusive of, but well beyond the endpoints built into the Taegis platform. All of this with no configuration required and with the use of the Taegis agent and unlimited 24/7 incident response included, we met their security needs with lower total spend. We continue to expand our MSSP partnerships and enable our better together go-to-market motion this quarter. We signed a new agreement with one of the largest multi-national companies based in Asia Pacific, our largest Taegis managed services partner in the region. While our MSSP partners appreciate the scale and margins available with an MDR offering on Taegis, they also cite our unique open endpoint approach with single-agent capability and bolstering their ability to win in a broader addressable market. We recently worked with a partner to win a competitive deal with a new customer, a large manufacturing company that was looking for our placement for their existing MSSP service wrapped around a SIM, which gave them no visibility into raw telemetry or alerts real-time, forcing them to rely on periodic manual reports. The customer was aware that the attack sophistication had changed. They needed to, as they said, up their game and they additionally wanted to secure their recent investment in Microsoft E5 licenses. The customer was pleased with our open without compromise approach with full visibility and detection capabilities across their O365 and cloud ecosystem, which allows Taegis to be used collaboratively and most importantly transparently across customer teams, our MSSP partners and Secureworks security experts, all of whom have the same visibility into the efficacy and actions in the platform, the detection sources, threat context, investigation steps and more, working interoperably in real-time to beat the adversary. In addition to budget considerations, customers are focused on materially reducing cybersecurity risk and building our resilience and ability to respond successfully in case of an incident. Trends in recent years have shown an increase in customer preference for cyber insurance policies, which offer faster response from a pool of pre-approved incident response providers in a more cost-efficient manner for the customer. We signed with several large cyber insurance partners in third quarter, including one of the largest multinational insurance providers in Asia Pacific, AXA XL, and an exclusive partnership with Privacy Rules, an alliance of privacy-focused law firms with members in 60 countries. We remain confident that our partnerships are an important path to market as customers value the advisory role that they play in recommending trusted solutions and in easing the procurement process. An insurance panel membership elevates Secureworks' brand presence and provides strong third-party validation of the Taegis platform and solutions, improving the go-to-market motions for Secureworks and our partners As with any new go-to-market motion, it takes time for investments to bear fruit. But we are putting the building blocks in place to position our business for long-term growth. As I look at the market from a macro perspective, we continue to experience elongated sales cycles versus last year. The drivers during the customer decision-making process remain consistent as most organizations are focused on fiscal prudence around all investments. We continue to see elevated layers of deal review with higher level approvals required in the customer decision-making process. We have yet to see indications that this will change in the near term. Additionally, Q4 has historically been the strongest quarter for sequential growth in Taegis ARR. However, we do not expect to see the same level of budget flush we've seen in past fourth quarters, which we are reflecting in our updated fiscal '24 ARR guidance. Moving to an update on new product capabilities. This quarter, we delivered on the expansion of our platform capabilities to better support partners and customers. We introduced the ability for partners to accelerate customer onboarding with streamline tenant management and advanced customer permission configurations to efficiently threat-hunt across their customer base, leveraging our advanced proactive hunting playbooks and to bring custom detections and intelligence to the platform with integrations natively. This is one of the many areas where we see the power of collaboration, community and being open without compromise as the most effective approach to outpacing the adversary. Because we understand the growing importance of cloud protection for our customers, we launched several new capabilities this quarter, including additional AWS integrations, providing increased visibility and leveraging Taegis' detection capabilities for cloud-based threats, Taegis endpoint agent support for additional Linux distributions, helping protect a broader set of cloud-based workloads and making key cloud workload metadata available within Taegis, driving faster triage, investigation and response workflows. We also delivered on the expansion of our platform capabilities to add features that advanced security and permission configurations in Taegis to address the needs of diverse operational environments, integrating advanced threat detection for real-time awareness. The enhanced security and permission configurations in Taegis cater to a variety of operational needs, offering partners and customers a more versatile, tailored and comprehensive SOC platform. I continue to be pleased with the outcomes AI is generating for our customers. Taegis has leveraged AI since inception, our first advanced detectors for machine learning and deep learning base and we have used AI heavily to drive automation and efficiency through every aspect of the platform. This quarter, we continued to make significant advancements in the Taegis platform, leveraging the integration of machine learning and large language models, alongside our unique cloud architecture to enhance the platform's security analytics and SecOps efficiency. Over the last year, we saw significant gains from AI-assisted automation, decision-making and threat detection. With our investments, we have leveraged our body of investigation reports as training data for the development of a customer-facing reporting system that creates, enriches and escalates investigation reports in less than half the manual process time We launched a patent pending prioritization engine, which processes more than 1 trillion events across our customers. This systems help surface critical threats to better secure customers, while improving notification times by 80% and reducing SOC analyst triage workload by 50%, largely through the elimination of low confidence alerts. This has led to detection improvements for our customers and efficiency gains for us. AI Technology is crucial to bridging the widening security talent gap, bolstering our collective defense mechanisms, and democratizing advanced security capabilities. But at Secureworks, we integrate generative AI into our processes with deliberation and care. Our stance is clear. No technology, however advanced, is presumed secure. It was first into our rigorous and comprehensive development practices, only after a thorough testing by our product team and security analysts, do we consider deploying new capabilities into our platform and making them available to our customers. Our approach is methodical, conducting controlled experiments, continuously educating our team and crucially ensuring that any new capabilities align with our stringent development criteria before, during and after release. In this way, we not only stay at the forefront of AI development, but we ensure it's not only secure, but underpins rapid innovation while upholding our unwavering commitment to deliver on our company purpose to secure human progress. We are delivering and remain committed to building the foundation for sustainable growth that allows us to scale, realize improvements in productivity and drive operational efficiencies into the business that will enable us to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA. As we saw this quarter, we are driving Taegis margin expansion through automation, continued cloud architecture scaling and by leveraging our investments in AI. It's equally important that we continue to invest in the highest-quality solutions to reduce risk and provide superior security outcomes for our customers and partners to retain our market leadership position. We are rapidly approaching the sunset of our other MSS business in the first quarter of fiscal '25, a milestone that is a significant positive for our business and which will alleviate the remaining headwind on our total revenue. Our Q3 results give us further confidence in reaching the key milestone of adjusted EBITDA profitability, and we're reaching the inflection point before we complete the wind-down of our other MSS business lines. We will continue to reduce costs related to our sunsetting businesses during the first half of fiscal '25, which will contribute to our profitability into the future. I want to thank our customers and partners for joining forces with us, and my thanks to our teammates for their diligence, integrity and commitment to securing our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Alpana to walk through our financial results and guidance.\nAlpana Wegner: Thanks, Wendy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased we delivered against our financial commitments in the third quarter and the progress we've made on our path to profitability and cash flow generation. I'll start with the highlights of our Q3 financial results, and then I will provide expectations for the remainder of the year. Total revenue for the quarter was $89.4 million, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance of $88 million to $90 million. Total revenue continues to be impacted by the wind-down of our other MSS business. Taegis subscription revenue was $67.3 million, up 1% sequentially and 41% year-over-year, in line with our expectation. Taegis ARR increased 25% year-over-year to $278.7 million, now representing 92% of our total ARR. Average revenue per Taegis customer expanded sequentially to $139,000, driven by higher new logo ARPC and continued expansion of spend by our existing customers. Taegis ARPC remains a premium to both the industry average and to our historical other MSS average, underscoring the value that Taegis provides our customers. Non-GAAP Taegis gross margin expanded 200 basis points sequentially to 72.7% this quarter, and showed an improvement of 510 basis points versus third quarter a year ago, demonstrating the scale opportunity within the Taegis business. As Wendy shared earlier, our unique cloud architecture allows us to improve our operational efficiency to drive Taegis margin expansion by using automation, investment in AI and machine learning. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.2 million compared to a $17.2 million loss in the prior-year period, reflecting the expansion of gross margin within our Taegis business I just discussed, as well as the benefit of the restructuring activities from earlier this year. Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter with a strong balance sheet with $58.1 million in cash, no debt and an undrawn credit facility. We used $4.5 million of cash from operations compared with $26.8 million used in the prior-year period, which primarily reflects decrease in our net loss and the timing of working capital. Now turning to our guidance. Before I go through a detailed guidance, I'd like to provide some commentary on what is shaping our full year outlook for Taegis ARR. First, we continue to experience a challenging macro environment that is leading to elongated sales cycles. We don't see any evidence of this changing in the near term. And second, we are not expecting the same magnitude of fourth quarter budget flush that we've seen historically. For the full year, we now expect Taegis ARR to end at $280 million or greater. We continue to expect other MSS ARR to represent 5% or less of total ARR. And we expect Taegis revenue to end between $264 million to $266 million and a total revenue between $363 million to $365 million, reflecting the continued wind-down of our other MSS business with an expected end of life in first quarter of next fiscal year. Our outlook on profitability has slightly improved, taking into consideration our Q3 results. We now expect for the full year Taegis gross margins to be greater than 71%. With Q4 margins remaining relatively flat to the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $31 million to $33 million with Q4 adjusted EBITDA of breakeven to slightly positive. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS loss to between $0.33 to $0.35. And we continue to expect net cash used in operating activities to be between $70 million and $80 million and CapEx of $6 million to $8 million. In terms of fiscal 2025, we will provide guidance for Q1 and the full year on our Q4 earnings call in March. In closing, we remain confident in the ability to drive sustainable profitable growth based on the progress we've made in building a strong partner ecosystem, the customer outcomes from the investments in our unique Taegis XDR platform, the continued opportunity for scale, driven by our cloud architecture and the upcoming end of life of our other MSS business. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Wendy will now rejoin us, as we begin Q&A. Operator, can you please introduce the first question?\nOperator: Sure. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham. Mike, your line is now open.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. You have Mike Cikos here, and thanks for taking the questions. I did just want to follow up since I know Alpana just went through the guidance considerations here and I know you're -- we have this revised ARR guidance for Taegis with respect to the elongated sales cycles and the now -- we're expecting not a similar budget flush to previous years. Like, can you help us unpack those two items as far as inputs for the ARR guide? How much is coming from the elongated sales cycles versus the reduced budget flush expectations? And really, if you could also qualify that sales cycle elongation we're seeing, is that even on a sequential basis or is it more of a year-to-year comment?\nWendy Thomas: Sure. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the questions. So let me break those two apart for you. In terms of the elongated sales cycles, that continues to be up versus last year, not a material change sequentially from 2Q. So the majority for us is looking as we head into the fourth quarter, not seeing the normal sort of seasonal shift in pipelines as we come in from the normal kind of budget flush. I think that's just related to the continued caution around making investments. Right, these are multi-year investments in security and it's important, and the additional layers of review and approval to make sure that those decisions that lock them in are good ones. And that's just the piece that we see along with not getting to kind of use your budget this year, it's kind of more lose it than use it in the fourth quarter.\nMike Cikos: Got it. And I did just want to come back to the comment as well. I believe Wendy, in the prepared remarks, and correct me if I'm wrong on go to market, but more than 90% of global Taegis new logo business in the quarter was driven from quarters -- from partners, I'm sorry versus 40% last year. And I just wanted to make sure I'm interpreting that correctly. The Taegis customer count, I think, has been relatively stable, around 2,000 customers now for the last four quarters. And I'm trying to just figure out, does it take time for those new logos to show up in the customer count? Or how is -- I guess, when can we expect broader market traction with Taegis, just given that customer count for Taegis has been relatively stable for, I guess, a year now?\nWendy Thomas: Sure. So part of our partner go-to-market strategy is going to market with managed security partners. And as I talked about, we continue to sign larger, high profile partners in that space because they see the efficacy of the platform. But currently in our customer counts, we only count those partners, no matter how many end customers they add as one customer in our accounts. So, we have highlighted the expansion in average revenue per customer. So, as you saw, that was $139,000 versus -- up from 135-or-so last quarter. And that's why we measure both of those is because that's an important measure of market traction that isn't necessarily reflected in the way we report our customer counts today.\nAlpana Wegner: Yeah. And Mike, this is Alpana. One other thing I might just add. The logo count also don't -- as Wendy said, don't give us the reflection from an overall sort of scale. And one of the other things that we do look to is endpoint. And I would say that, what we see sequentially there, quarter-over-quarter is growth, again just underscoring the expansion may not be able to be seen through the logo count, but we are -- we're pleased with the progress that we're making.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you. Thank you both for qualifying that last comment. Thank you.\nWendy Thomas: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Hamza, your line is now open.\nMatt Saltzman: Great. Thanks. This is Matt Saltzman on for Hamza. So I know you mentioned that the Q4 pipeline might be a little bit lighter, just since you're not expecting that same level of budget flush this year. But could you talk a little bit about pipeline early into fiscal '25? I know you're not ready to formally guide yet, but how are demand trends looking as the pipeline builds for next year? And anything we should be thinking about in terms of demand dynamics that you're seeing in the market today? Thanks.\nWendy Thomas: Sure. Thanks, Matt. Good morning. We absolutely see the total pipeline remaining healthy. What we didn't see was the kind of pull into fourth quarter that we typically see around trying to take advantage of end of year budgets. So that's one thing for us. The other is that for our go-to-market shift here, the increasing mix from partners is also pretty important. What we see around other things of kind of the pace of the win rates on sort of technical approvals and win rates on proof of value or proof of concepts remain steady. So, it's just that same sort of cautious multi-layered assessment of things and not the rush to buy inside of that pipeline that we may have seen in years past.\nMatt Saltzman: Got it. And maybe if I could just ask a quick follow-up just around go-to-market orientation being more skewed towards partners now. Do you feel that maybe, things might actually not be as -- I guess, maybe there aren't as many headwinds in Q4 as you would usually expect, but maybe there's just less visibility because you're going through that partner channel?\nWendy Thomas: In terms of the pipeline?\nMatt Saltzman: Yeah. Just in terms of customer spend intention since a lot of those engagements are happening at the partner level now. Perhaps, there is just lower visibility and things may not actually be that bad or kind of -- I guess, to ask a better question, how do you think about assessing the demand environment when more of the go-to-market is going, via external sources?\nWendy Thomas: So, it's a good question. And we have been cautious in terms of learning the win rates and cycle times with relatively new partnerships. So, there's certainly a learning curve that we're on there in terms of predictability. We do engage with those deals and have some amount of visibility into the pipeline from deal registration and such, but it is true. It is a different motion, and therefore our sort of range of outcomes on that can be a little more dispersed than it was when we were a pure direct model a couple of years ago.\nMatt Saltzman: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal, your line is now open.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, team. You have Madeline on for Tal this morning. Just one quick one for me. I just want to go back to the budget flush commentary. If we look across cyber peers over the last year budget flush, the lack of the 4Q budget flush also happened last year. And some would argue to a bigger extent because it was definitely more unexpected last year. I feel like though, given the macro environment that we've been in over the last 12 months and potentially even more, budget flush was -- the lack of budget flush was expected, right, we thought last year. So I guess I just want to understand why it's new for just you guys this year, or why maybe the impact is greater for you this year versus peers who aren't feeling the same. Thanks.\nAlpana Wegner: Yes. Good morning, Madeline. This is Alpana. Thanks for the question. I would say that for us, it was more in our commentary is really around the change in the guide. Last year in Q4, we did see a good amount of budget flush come through. You can see sequentially when you look from Q3 to Q4 last year, we had a nice quarter from an ARR growth perspective. And really the commentary was just around when we set our guide last quarter, we had some expectations, not the same level as last year, but we did think we'd see some. And so, the revised view is really as we move through Q3 and as we've looked at the pipeline and the demand that we're seeing, while there's a lot of good activity and good discussions with prospects and we're seeing those sales cycles in the demand holding. We didn't see that natural increase, albeit at a lower level than last year that we were expecting when we had previously set our guide.\nUnidentified Participant: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We currently have no further questions. So I would like to hand the call back to Kevin Toomey for closing remarks. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Toomey: Okay, thank you. That wraps the Q&A and today's call. A replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations page at secureworks.com along with our supplemental web deck with additional financial tables. Thanks again for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."

So, Mr. Toomey, you may begin your conference.\nKevin Toomey: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to SecureWorks' second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Wendy Thomas, our Chief Executive Officer; and Alpana Wegner, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, unless otherwise indicated, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the reconciliations between these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in the press release and presentation posted on the website earlier today. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release, web deck, and SEC filings, which you can also find on the Investor Relations website at investors.secureworks.com. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to SecureWorks CEO, Wendy Thomas.\nWendy Thomas: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone I'm pleased to share that we delivered on our financial commitments in the second quarter and executed on several key strategic milestones. We also took actions to align our cost structure to our go-forward SaaS business, laying the foundations for profitability in fiscal '25. Taegis annual recurring revenue or ARR was $276 million at the end of the second quarter. And Taegis revenue grew 55% year-over-year to $66 million in the quarter. To put those numbers into context, that puts us in the top three in terms of global market share for managed detection and response, out of more than 50 tracked companies as published by Gartner. The majority of organizations find it challenging to outpace growing cyber risk without the technology and expertise SecureWorks and its partners bring to managing detection and response operations. Our platform design and productization strategy positions us to leverage MDR as the leading edge to drive adoption of our Taegis XDR platform, differentiating our managed XDR approach from others in the market. This, with our multiple partner-led go-to-market path, that broaden our region's coverage enable us to capitalize on a large and expanding market opportunity. The Taegis platform was uniquely designed to address the security challenges of our customers and partners in several ways. First, Taegis is open without compromise. This means Taegis provides customers real choice around security controls such as endpoint, cloud, identity, and network, and more importantly, pivots with customer technology choices over time. And as market recognition of our XDR platform grows, I'm pleased to share we were named a leader in the recent 2023 Frost & Sullivan XDR Radar report, earning the top innovations product in the open XDR category. Second, Taegis provides superior detection, separating the signal from the noise, and with our fixed per ends pricing, we incent customers to share the full breadth of their security telemetry with us. This translates into enhanced detection performance for our customers and alleviates the need for them to compromise security for their purpose of minimizing the volume-based pricing that many XDR vendors charge. And as our partner ecosystem expands, the depth and breadth of the telemetry we ingest makes Taegis even more powerful. Third, Taegis provides unmatched response with integrated proprietary orchestration and automation capabilities, a growing set of response playbooks, and access to unlimited incident response. What this means for our customers is an industry-leading return on investment with superior security outcomes. I'll turn now to a couple of market observations and then provide an update on our go-to-market results. First, consistent with the reports of others in the industry, we continued to experience longer sales cycles than a year ago. These are largely driven by longer customer decision-making cycle times, primarily a result of increased layers of deal review. In this environment of heightened fiscal responsibility, technology budget decisions more often reach the highest levels of the organization. We do not see indicators of this changing in the near term. Second, we're encouraged to see more prospects actively planning for XDR adoption because market awareness grows, and customers, who have already adopted Taegis XDR laying out roadmaps for security vendor consolidation with native security controls, embedded orchestration, and a minimum of one-year storage included. Taegis XDR makes it possible for customers to realize better security for less money with fewer vendors. Let me share some customer examples of how Taegis is resonating in the market. Last quarter, we won a leading utility infrastructure company with the teams that invested in a variety of security controls in recent years in response to a security posture assessment. But the results weren't what they were hoping for. Their team was overwhelmed with low fidelity alerts from a variety of costly and unconnected security controls, and in the face of rising cyber risk to their business. This customer was seeking valid detection and a streamlined approach to investigations and remediation, and they had a mandate to scale their existing investment in their SOC team. They saw the power of Taegis XDR to work across their existing investments with a path to streamline those investments as contracts come up for renewal. And importantly, they immediately benefited from fewer, higher fidelity detections with full threat context and response recommendations. They have shared with us yet another prospect how powerful and reassuring it has been to have rapid access to security experts via chat in 90 seconds or less, a unique feature for subscribers to our XDR software. Another great win this quarter was an expansion with the current customer, a $6 billion multinational consumer goods manufacturing company that saw the power of Taegis in improving their security operations in Europe and decided to extend Taegis to the rest of their organization. Taegis enabled them to implement a global governance model across their corporate headquarters and regional security teams across all major continents of the world. The ease of deployment and the ability to seamlessly manage operations across the follow-the-fund SOC model as well as predictable pricing were the key drivers for this customer to expand their relationship with SecureWorks as their global security platform partner. I'd like to share a few highlights on how we are expanding our partner ecosystem through our multiple go-to-market channels, including MSSPs that sell and deliver Taegis-powered security services under their brands; solution providers that sell Taegis with SecureWorks delivered services in targeted markets; cyber risk partners who can reduce breach exposure for their customers by leveraging our portfolio of solutions; and technology alliance partners to create seamless protection for our joint customers. We're doing great progress in our MSSP partner program this quarter, a large and growing market opportunity for us. Partners are choosing to build our MDR business on Taegis based upon the compelling return on investment opportunity and positive Taegis customer feedback. While these relationships have a long sales cycle, we're seeing the beginning stages of pipeline conversion with our MSSP partners as indicated by our new partnership with EY. EY recently announced their intelligence extended detection and response service powered by SecureWorks Taegis XDR. Taegis as uniquely positioned to be the platform of choice for MSSPs to run their security operations with maximum effectiveness and efficiency, creating better outcomes for their customers and grow their business profitably. Turning to solution providers. We've expanded our partner first motion since our launch in North America last December, having executed on our plan to extend the program to the Middle East, the United Kingdom and for Europe. We remain confident that these partners are an important path to market as customers value the advisory role that solution providers play in recommending trusted solutions and easing the procurement process. With any new sales motion, instead of relationships like this, it takes time to ramp. Under the leadership of our new CRO, who started this past quarter, we are deepening our relationships with the partner community globally and refining the sales motions to capitalize on the partner-led opportunity. Year-to-date, more than 60% of global Taegis new acquisition business was closed with the partner. We're also expanding our technology alliance relationships. We remain committed to cementing new partnerships with market-leading technologies to create seamless security visibility and superior security outcomes for our customers enabled by the open XDR approach of Taegis. For example, we recently announced a partnership with Akamai, a global cloud services leader, integrating their leading zero-trust network access solutions into Taegis. Embedding the data and intelligence to scale secure access is fundamental in an era of work anywhere which is driving identity to become the new perimeter. Moving to an update on product development. This quarter, we expanded our platform capabilities to improve alert triage with an automated role-based process for creating and updating investigations, directly benefiting our customers by minimizing the time between detection and executing a response. This also drives scale by reducing the workload for MDR analysts. This is just one example of our investments in automation this year that have yielded a significant reduction in the time to complete investigations, supporting more rapid response and driving our highest customer satisfaction ratings in this area to date. If you recall in the first quarter, we discussed two new offerings to unify the way companies prevent, detect, and respond to threats across both IT and OT or operational technology environments. During the second quarter, we launched Taegis integrations with two leaders in OT monitoring, Claroty and [indiscernible] which can be managed to the Taegis in the context of a customer's entire attack surface. These new partnerships provide more visibility, threat detection and response for traditionally siloed IT and OT environments, while improving the search, event analysis and response experience in Taegis. We are seeing strong interest in our OT offering as we are well-positioned to address the rising risk of breach from converged OT and IT environments in the industrial space. Before I hand the call over to Alpana to walk through our financial results, let me shift gears and talk about our path to profitable growth. Our competitive advantages are resonating in the market and demand for our solutions is increasing. The depth and breadth of our partnership ecosystem provides diverse vectors for growth well into the future. I'm pleased with the progress our team has made, since the launch of our partner first go-to-market motion, but with broader sales cycle elongation, the conversion to the top-line is taking longer than we initially projected. In addition, our other MSS business lines are sunsetting faster, which is a positive for the business in the long term. However, it is creating a near-term headwind on our total revenue this year. As such, we are revising our full-year revenue and our ARR guidance to reflect these shifts in timing. We are delivering and remain committed to improving adjusted EBITDA while investing in the highest-quality solutions and security outcomes for our customers and partners to retain our market leadership position. I want to thank our customers and partners for joining forces with us, and my thanks to our teammates for their hard work and commitment to the SecureWorks mission of securing human progress. I also want to welcome Alpana Wegner for her first SecureWorks earnings call since joining us in June. I look forward to working closely with her as we drive growth and scale into our business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Alpana to walk through our financial results and guidance.\nAlpana Wegner: Thanks, Wendy. Good morning everyone. I'm excited to join SecureWorks, a time where the business is pivoting to financial model that has highly recurring revenue and support scalability and profitability. I'll start with the highlights of our Q2 financial results and then I will provide expectations for Q3 in the remainder of the year.  Total revenue for the quarter was $93 million, above the high end of our guidance of $90 million to $92 million, driven primarily by higher professional services revenue. Our Taegis business performed in line with our expectations in the quarter. Taegis subscription revenue was $66 million, up 6% sequentially and 55% year-over-year. Taegis ARR increased 37% year-over-year to $276 million, now representing more than 90% of our total ARR. Average revenue per Taegis customer health at $135,000 and remains a premium to both the industry average and to our historical other MSS average, underscoring the value that Taegis provides our customers. Total gross margin expanded 70 basis points sequentially to 70.7% this quarter and showed an improvement of 520 basis points versus second quarter a year ago, demonstrating the scalable opportunity within the Taegis business. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $10.3 million compared to a $14.3 million loss in the prior year period, reflecting our actions to lower operating costs and to expand the gross margin of our Taegis business. Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with a strong balance sheet with $65 million of cash, no debt and an undrawn credit facility. We used $28 million of cash from operations compared with $17 million used in the prior year period, which primarily reflects the timing of cash receipts and the timing of net transactions with Dell. We recently expanded and extended our existing revolving line of credit to a $50 million facility with a maturity and repayment period of March 2026, providing us with longer-term additional liquidity. Before moving to guidance, I would like to provide additional details on the restructuring activity we announced last month, which further aligned our cost structure to our highly scalable Taegis centric business model. The annualized impact of the cost reductions in total are expected to be $50 million. As we previously shared, the other MSS and nonstrategic services business are rolling off at a faster pace than originally projected. And accordingly, we have been actively managing the related costs out. After taking into effect the reductions we announced last month, we estimate approximately $10 million on an annualized basis of duplicative fixed and transition-related costs remaining in the business with a split of 80/20 across cost of revenue and operating expenses. We expect these costs to roll off as we complete the end of life in the first half of fiscal '25. The remainder of the cost reductions were in operating expenses, we identified opportunities across G&A, R&D and sales and marketing to streamline, simplify and align to our SaaS model, including efficiencies from our partner first go-to-market. We recognized $14 million of restructuring costs in Q2, $11 million of which will be paid in cash outflows, with the majority being in second half of fiscal '24. Now turning to our guidance. Our revenue and our ARR outlook for the remainder of the year is shaped by two primary factors. The first is we expect to continue to wind down our other MSS business at a faster pace than previously anticipated. And the second, as Wendy mentioned earlier, while we are building strong solution provider relationships and growing pipeline, the ramp time for our ARR and professional services has elongated. For the third quarter of fiscal '24, we expect total revenue of between $88 million to $90 million and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.05 and $0.07. For the full year, we now expect Taegis ARR to end between $285 million and $300 million, which at the midpoint is a 12% year-over-year growth. We continue to expect other MSS ARR to represent 5% or less of total ARR. Taegis revenue between $264 million to $268 million and total revenue of between $360 million to $368 million. Our outlook on profitability takes into consideration the recent restructuring activities. We continue to expect Taegis gross margins to be 70% or better, adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $31 million to $37 million and adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter near breakeven and EBITDA profitability in fiscal '25. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS loss to be between $0.36 and $0.41 and we expect net cash used in operating activities to be between $70 million and $80 million. This change reflects the timing of the cash outlay related to restructuring costs I just covered, as well as a reduction of $5 million in tax benefit realization and $8 million related to a state sales tax settlement. We also expect CapEx of $6 million to $8 million. In closing, I'm pleased we delivered against our financial commitments in the second quarter. We believe our differentiated platform stages, our extensive security expertise, the multiple go-to-market paths we have underway and our actions in fiscal '24 will drive our business to sustainable profitable growth next year. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Wendy will now rejoin us as we begin Q&A. Operator, can you please introduce the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. The first question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham.\nMike Cikos: Thanks team, for getting me on here. I'm really looking forward to working with you upon - I think this is our first time having you on for a company call now. I guess my first question would be for Wendy. And one of the things I'm trying to figure out when I look at Slide 4, for example, it shows that the Taegis customer count has been at 2,000 now. I think this is the third consecutive quarter. So my question is, I guess, what is SecureWorks doing to help drive net new logos to the Taegis platform? And when can we expect to start seeing that show through on the customer count.\nWendy Thomas: Good morning. What we have in our Taegis logo count is a rounded number. So you don't see some of the movement in that necessarily each quarter. But we - customer count this quarter was fairly consistent with what you see in the ARR line. As our business model is shifting in terms of a couple of things. One, our platform was designed for a target market that is both a little more upmarket, and you see that in our average revenue per customer of 134,000 versus some of our - the rest of the competitors in the market in terms of that average, as well as to target managed services providers who, in our customer count, the end customer count doesn't show up there. It's one MSP partner. So we tend to focus in on the ARPC as much as anything in terms of that revenue opportunity. And then clearly, as we're making the partner shift as well, and you saw the announcement we've expanded into Europe and the Middle East this quarter and having signed those partners to launch in those markets. We see growing demand and pipeline from the partners that we've launched in North America and expect to see that same ramp with those partners as well. So it's just go-to-market shift and expansion opportunity that will drive that growth going forward.\nMike Cikos: Great. Thanks for that Wendy. And I guess just a follow-up. I know we're talking about the sales cycles here. I guess my question is, did we actually see sales cycles elongate for looking at this most recent quarter versus quarter - versus the previous quarter. I know that we've seen extension on a year-to-year basis, but just wanted to see if there was any incremental elongation on a sequential basis. And I guess just a follow-up for Alpana as well. Just given, call it, $65 million in cash on the sheet exiting the quarter and the expectation for continued usage over the remainder of the year with updated guidance. Can you give us a sense for, I guess, your cushion, what you're comfortable with on the sheet before maybe you start tapping into the revolver you have just anything there would be beneficial. Thank you, guys.\nWendy Thomas: Okay. I'll take the first part and hand off to Alpana. So the good news is, security is clearly still a high priority for customers. What we don't see is customers saying, no. The demand is there. Our pipeline is increasing and it's growing in terms of the mix with partners as we expand that partner ecosystem. So what we do see is that there is just this era right now and every organization is looking to operate at a heightened level of fiscal management. And so we do see more layers of deal review, additional layers, if you will. And we did see that elongate in 2Q versus first quarter as well as year-over-year. So it's just an opportunity for organizations to make sure that when they make this investment, they are - they're doing so with a full understanding of the opportunity, the road map for future savings and that they have a partner that they trust to be in this with them as more than a vendor but truly someone who is engaged in evolving with their business. And I think that's one of the unique things given our reputation and brand and how we operate with our existing customers who provide tremendous references for us, that is the strength of turning that pipeline into ARR.\nAlpana Wegner: And good morning, Mike, this is Alpana. It's nice to speak to you this morning and look forward to talking further with you. As it relates to the question on cash, yes, as you noted, we ended the quarter with $65 million on the balance sheet. From my perspective, I think of our use of cash, tracking pretty closely from a trend perspective with what we're looking from an outlook perspective on the shift in trajectory with EBITDA. And so as we see EBITDA improving with the guide of a breakeven in Q4 of this year, I would say that you should expect to see our cash flow trending in the same direction with cash flow generation coming next year. And so from your question on the revolver, it's nice to have. We're very happy with where that's at, having it at $50 million in a three-year term now with the most recent amendment, but I don't see a need in the near term from an operating cash flow perspective, needing to tap into it any time in the near term.\nMike Cikos: Terrific. Thank you for all the color guys. I'll turn it over to my colleagues. I appreciate it.\nWendy Thomas: Thank you.\nAlpana Wegner: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Wendy, just maybe first one for you to follow up on the last question. Just on the overall demand environment, would you say that you're starting to see some stability? Are things getting maybe slightly worse? Any sort of green shoots that you see in terms of broader security demand trends on your end?\nWendy Thomas: Sure. Good morning. From our end, we do see, as I mentioned, demand and pipeline increasing, so we do see good shoots there and not the kind of - not spending at all on security that we saw probably 1.5 years ago, where people really took a pause. So that part is positive, absolutely. The second part for us is that XDR and MDR are still markets that are in ramping adoption, if you will. And I would say that the market awareness of and understanding of MDR for certain and now XDR is growing, so that it's kind of become an area of why aren't you making a plan for this kind of transition of a legacy SIM or really a people-led security operation. And so we view that as another positive trend for our business versus obviously very mature security product markets that are in a different space now.\nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. And maybe just one quick follow-up for Alpana. I'm sorry if I missed it, but was there any color or indication on when we would see a return to sort of revenue growth again?\nAlpana Wegner: We are not currently guiding to fiscal '25. But what we are providing is the outlook from a profitability and cash flow perspective for '25 is there. What I would say is our continued focus on growth is front and center. There's no deceleration in terms of our focus on it. And we're continuing to strategically look at taking the demand that we're seeing in the pipeline and how we look to convert that faster. And I would say the end of life that we've announced on our other MSS lines, we still see that progressing on track. If not, as we've mentioned, it's accelerating. And so as we come to a close and kind of get that top line overhang behind us in the first half of next year, we would certainly expect the top line to return to growth. If you look at the pages line on its own, it is growing. And so that would be an indicator as well as to where we see the future.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you so much.\nAlpana Wegner: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Toomey I turn the call back over to you.\nKevin Toomey: Okay. Thank you. That wraps the Q&A and today's call. A replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations page at secureworks.com, along with our supplemental web deck and additional financial tables. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.\nWendy Thomas: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining today's call. I can confirm today's call has now concluded. You may now disconnect, and enjoy the rest of your day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SecureWorks First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] A supplemental slide presentation to accompany the prepared remarks can be found on the company's website. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Toomey, SecureWorks Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Toomey, you may begin your conference.\nKevin Toomey: Thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me this morning are Wendy Thomas, our CEO; and Christian Grant, our Interim CFO. During this call, unless otherwise indicated, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the reconciliations between these GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website earlier today. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year changes unless otherwise specified. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our press release, web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn the call over to SecureWorks CEO, Wendy Thomas.\nWendy Thomas: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone. Taegis continues to lead the industry with 68% year-over-year revenue growth, expanding to $63 million in the first quarter. Taegis annual recurring revenue expanded to $269 million at the end of the first quarter and now represents over 85% of our total ARR, up from less than half of total ARR this time last year. To put that into context, this quarter, we were recognized by multiple leading industry analyst reports as one of the top three largest providers of managed detection and response in the market. That's important because customers have a choice in a noisy market and they're choosing SecureWorks. In my conversations with potential customers, in this climate of increased focus on fiscal responsibility, they are focused on the win-win that Taegis can deliver. A solution that helps them consolidate and reduce the number of security vendors that they have to manage, that scales their spend on both security technology and talent while simultaneously delivering an improved security risk posture and outcomes. We are well positioned to address this market need based on our unique approach to the design of our Taegis XDR platform and customers are reaping the benefits of our XDR enabled MDR. We solved the signal-to-noise problem that drives alert fatigue from multiple point products. We provide a comprehensive protection to stop adversaries who look between point products and our open without compromise approach gives customers choice, future flexibility and an easy deployment path to achieve comprehensive detection and response. In this vein, we are addressing an acute need to replace legacy SIMs, which are difficult to deploy and configure and their complexity makes them costly to maintain. For example, in first quarter, we won a global provider of smart building solutions that came to SecureWorks originally for penetration testing services. We quickly discovered a ransomware attack despite their significant investments in a SEM, an endpoint and vulnerability management technologies. Like so many organizations, they did not have the resources to constantly manage the SEM until left many of their office locations unmonitored. They quickly recognize the return on investment of managed detection and response with Taegis, reduce their vendor sprawl and spend while fully securing their entire environment. Customers choose Taegis for its measurable and superior return on investment that lets them streamline security vendors and spend, increase the value of uptime of their business operations and revenue streams and the ability to optimize investments in internal security teams, all while achieving superior security outcomes, quantifiable risk reduction. We also expanded our platform capabilities and portfolio of offerings this quarter. We recently announced two new offerings to unify the way companies prevent, detect and respond to threats across both OT and IT environments, eliminating the visibility challenges often associated with the separation of those systems and addressing the risks of greater attack service exposure in legacy OT systems. Industrials and multiple sectors have been increasingly under attack by threat actors. And with our significant presence and expertise in this vertical today, we see untapped potential to solve a pressing security needs by unifying detection and response across OT and IT via the Taegis platform and staying true to our overall approach to XDR. The pricing is simple and predictable, endpoint-based upcharge with no data overage, storage or other surprise fees. In support of customer choice and aligned with our pillar to be open without compromise, we recently added out-of-the-box support for a growing integration request from our customers and partners, SentinelOne's Singularity Complete. Taegis now ingest SentinelOne telemetry into an overall view of cloud identity, network and other application data in the Taegis XDR UI, enriches and correlates that data with threat context and applies our unique detectors and response actions in the platform to drive superior security outcomes. With our unique approach in Taegis, customers can leverage a single EDR agent for holistic XDR and MDR coverage, further removing the friction and complexity of multi-vendor environments. With this addition, we now integrate seamlessly with nearly 70% of the endpoint market, another example of how we optimize customers' existing and future cybersecurity investments while also providing the breadth of security coverage they need. Taegis is increasingly there's no pane of glass for our customers' entire security stack. We recently won a partner source deal with a manufacturing company that had a small IT team, no stock and very limited visibility into their environment. And a competitor in their space had recently been the victim of a cyber-attack and data breach, creating urgency and their leadership team around ensuring they could prevent a similar breach. The customer had recently implemented SentinelOne with our partner, and our demo and proof-of-concept demonstrating the ease of deployment and holistic visibility of XDR while leveraging their existing single agents. Those are what steal the deal. Another topic that is top of mind for customers and investors is how we leverage and govern AI in our Taegis platform and offering. From the beginning, AI has been part of our Taegis platform vision and architecture leveraged to drive more effective and faster, the detection and response outcomes for customers. Among many approaches, we leverage deep learning and machine learning and our thousands of detectors to find the true positives that other products miss. And AI-enabled threat scores support the prioritization of the hundreds of billions of alerts and indicators we receive from our customers daily. While approaches in AI algorithms can change rapidly, the key to staying ahead is having vast amounts of labeled training data, and we believe that we have one of the most valuable security training datasets globally. For example, we've performed more than 10,000 investigations annually for more than a decade. Leveraging that dataset, we recently implemented natural language processing, generative AI and other techniques to automate approximately 45% of our Taegis security investigation reports. While more opportunity lies ahead, this has further improved our market-leading response time for customers and the efficiency of our security operations. While AI is not a panacea and is not applicable to all security use cases, we are well positioned to capitalize on its momentum and opportunity. We have a deep bench of data scientists, software engineers and threat researchers working on a true XDR platform designed to take advantage of advancements in AI and data analytics to rapidly innovate to improve outcomes for our customers while protecting their most valuable assets. As importantly, we have educated our team and put in place sustained governance around the responsible use of AI, and we'll continue to safely incorporate it into our business and service of customers, teammates and investors. I'll now turn to our go-to-market. We are in the early innings of our go-to-market transformation, aligned to our Taegis centric business model, but I'm pleased with our progress. We designed Taegis to be transparent and collaborative providing flexibility and optionality around who manages detection and response activities. This enables MDR to be delivered by SecureWorks, a partner or a customer's own SOC team, all leveraging Taegis XDR. In addition to solution providers as a go-to-market path, this has enabled us to tap into the MSSP market opportunity, enabling partners to deliver high margin and effective MDR leveraging Taegis. In Q1, one of our MSSP partners worked with us on an MDR deal with a data analytics software provider that was using multiple security providers to manage different aspects of their security operations. They had a small security team, which made it challenging for them to keep track of threats and costly to manage and get the security value across these disparate partners. Taegis has brought the holistic streamlined approach they needed while also addressing their growing compliance needs, with the scaled MDR services from our partner. Recall that last December, SecureWorks launched our partner first go-to-market approach in North America, elevating our collaboration with critical managed service and solution providers as well as technology alliance partners. Our open without compromise strategy creates greater business opportunities for partners of all types. As an indicator of traction in first quarter, more than 60% of global Taegis new logo business was closed with a partner, up from 40% this time a year ago and partners with active pipeline have increased 40%, leading to a doubling of our partner pipeline in first quarter, a trend we expect to ramp over the course of this year. And we will continue to extend this partner-first strategy globally over the course of this year. We've brought in a seasoned Chief Revenue Officer to accelerate our go-to-market transformation. Allan Peters comes with a powerful combination of CRO leadership across SaaS, security product and services companies with a partner-led sales approach. He brings demonstrated success in driving incremental ARR growth by accelerating new customer acquisitions, platform adoption and channel growth and an expanding gross margin through better solutions mix and discount control, all driving improvements in key sales efficiency measures. Before I transition into our path to profitable growth, I'll just add color on our perspective on the macro environment in terms of its impact on sales. We did see longer sales cycles in first quarter than a year ago, largely as a result of increased layers of deal review at customers. But those sales cycle times have been largely in line with more recent quarterly trends. Based on what we see currently, we expect this to continue in the near term. We are driving our business to profitable growth as we complete our business transformation. Taegis continues to perform, growing faster than the industry and scaling gross margin. And as a business, we have and will continue to take decisive actions to align our cost structure with the SaaS nature and the revenue opportunity of our Taegis-centric business model. While Chris will provide more details, I'll highlight three primary areas of action that give us confidence in our ability to drive growing profitability into next year. First, we will continue to take advantage of automation and scale throughout the business. Second, our go-to-market transformation, in addition to benefiting the top line will drive increased sales efficiency. Third, we are accelerating the reduction of the remaining duplicative and transition costs as we wind down our other MSS business. Of note, the second quarter of this fiscal year will represent the inflection point for total revenue for SecureWorks with a return to sequential total revenue growth in the second half of this year. Very shortly, Alpana Wegner, will join us as our new CFO. Alpana brings to SecureWorks extensive experience developing business strategies, to drive outsized growth and strengthening organization's financial profiles by increasing scale and expanding EBITDA margins through operational efficiency. We have a clear path and a commitment to managing our business to profitable growth. I want to thank our customers and partners for joining forces with us and my thanks to our teammates for their hard work and commitment to the SecureWorks mission of securing human progress. I particularly want to thank Chris Grant for his partnership and support acting as our Interim CFO for the past month. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to walk through our financial results and guidance.\nChristian Grant: Thanks, Wendy. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024. Total revenue was $94.4 million in the first quarter, which compares to our guidance of $96 million to $98 million. The lower total revenue was driven by accelerated wind down of our other MSS business and customers delaying professional services projects. As a reminder, our professional services business includes both retainer-based and transactional services. In Q1, the delays we saw were in the transactional revenue, which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to the dependency on customer resource availability. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $20.1 million compared to a $7.8 million loss in prior year first quarter. The overall change was driven by the other MSS and professional services revenue just discussed. Offset by Taegis gross profit expansion and OpEx savings as we continue to align our cost structure with our Taegis-centric business. Overall, Taegis business performed in the first quarter as expected. Taegis subscription revenue was $62.6 million, up 68% year-over-year, in line with expectations. Taegis ARR increased nearly $90 million year-over-year to $269 million now representing more than 85% of our total ARR. With our resolutioning efforts substantially completed at the end of fiscal '23, the majority of our Taegis ARR growth this quarter was driven by new logos, upsell and cross-sell. Average revenue per Taegis customer was approximately 132,000 and we've added 600 Taegis customers since the first quarter of last year, representing year-over-year growth of 43%. I would like to highlight that Taegis average revenue per customer remained at a premium to the industry average. We took the unique approach of bundling a number of core capabilities such as one-year data retention, orchestration and hunting playbooks, endpoint agent and unlimited response in our core offering. Our higher average revenue per customer than our competitors benefits from the strategy and our target buyer segments. To provide more insights into the underlying financials of our Taegis business, we've enhanced our disclosures this quarter, providing a breakout of Taegis cost of revenue and gross margin. Taegis gross margin continues to scale, reaching 70% this quarter, 110 basis points higher than the first quarter a year ago. As we move towards the other MSS end of life in Japan in Q1 of next year, ARR and revenue in that business will continue to wind down. We anticipate eliminating the remainder of our other MSS cost structure at the same time that we sunset other MSS in Japan in Q2 of next year. As Wendy shared, we have also been actively managing down our OpEx as we align our expense base to our Taegis-centric business. Turning now to our cash and balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a strong balance sheet with $95 million of cash, no debt and an undrawn credit facility. We used $42 million of cash from operations compared with $25 million used in the prior year first quarter, which primarily reflected lower adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, our first quarter is seasonally the highest use of cash due to annual incentive payouts. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year '24. We are reiterating our guidance for Taegis ARR to end FY '24 at $300 million or higher. We expect other MSS ARR to represent approximately 5% of total ARR at the end of this fiscal year. Our full year total revenue guidance range is $380 million to $400 million with second quarter revenue of $90 million to $92 million. We continue to anticipate full year Taegis revenue to be $270 million to $280 million. Taegis gross margins are expected to expand from first quarter level as we progress throughout the year. The benefit of that within the total gross margin will be offset by duplicative fixed and transition costs as we sunset support for our other MSS services in Japan. We have previously stated that there are approximately $25 million of duplicative fixed and transition-related costs that we are incurring with $15 million in cost of revenues and $10 million in operating expenses. As we turn down other MSS services, we will manage the related cost out, one of several positive impacts to our operating structure in fiscal '24 and fiscal '25. As Wendy shared, we are actively managing our cost structure. We expect reductions in our operating costs to begin in the second half of the year as we align our resource allocation based on the faster runoff of the other MSS business. We have experienced significant improvements in our cost structure from our ongoing use of automation. We continue to drive automation and scale into our growing SaaS business. As our teams deploy AI across operations, we see improvements in all areas of our business, both in ways that directly benefit customers and in the scale of our operating model. Our investment in sales and marketing over the past year have enabled the repositioning of our brand, completing the resolutioning outside of Japan and supporting our transition to partner first model. It is early days in our partner first go-to-market. But with the resolution behind us in North America, we began recomposing our sales force by expanding our hunter capacity and reducing investments in account executives focused on resolution. This will be apparent in lower sales and marketing dollars spent this year as we are no longer compensating account executives to move existing customers from our other MSS platform to Taegis. R&D will also trend lower as we continue to reduce our engineering support costs related to our other MSS business. Full year adjusted EBITDA range is expected to be between negative $29 million and $39 million. Finally, full year non-GAAP EPS loss is expected to be between $0.34 and $0.43. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS loss to be between $0.15 to $0.17. In summary, Taegis continued to show strong momentum in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. As the sunset of our other MSS accelerates and we benefit from scale on our Taegis-centric business, Q2 is the trough in the transformation of our business. We expect our actions in fiscal '24 to lead our business to profitable growth next year. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Wendy will rejoin us as we begin Q&A. Operator, can you please introduce the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here.\nWendy Thomas: Good morning.\nSaket Kalia: Wendy, maybe for you. Appreciated the talk about ROI on Taegis in your opening remarks. I was wondering if you could just go one level deeper into that. And I guess the question is, based on your conversations with customers, where do you think -- or how do you think Taegis is driving the most ROI for those customers?\nWendy Thomas: Sure. Great question. Thanks, Saket. Hope you're doing well. We really see three primary areas, and I will try to do them in sort of order of magnitude, order -- the first one is clearly the productivity of their IT and security teams. When we think about the burden moving off of their team in terms of managing or building integrations, building detectors, the automation in the investigation and the response workflow. If there is -- if they have MDR with us or our partner that aspect of unlimited incident response for high and critical alert from Taegis. So they can either -- and they do both kinds of math, I don't need to struggle to hire and retain scarce security talent or as much or very often, they can turn their team to sort of the strategy of their security program as opposed to kind of the day-to-day management. Just talking to us [indiscernible] earlier this week who was looking to move on that journey now that she had moved to Taegis. The second one is they can clearly see a path to displace spend and frankly, the friction of managing a lot of different vendors. As you know, we continue to expand the XDR platform and a lot of individual point products for now, frankly, features or capabilities of Taegis. And of course, we include the endpoint agent, which we often see organizations deploy our agent in areas where they didn't deploy any type of other AV-type agent because it's included in the pricing and things like our ability to include one year of storage, you don't need separate log retention. Those are great examples of the path that can go on, on that front. And then the third one, which is a little bit harder to measure depending on the organization, but there's just less business downtime and user friction. Sometimes that does show up in terms of cyber insurance, actually lower rate. But a lot of times, it's just their sense of their ability to provide assurances to their Board that they know how absolutely full holistic coverage and, frankly, often better coverage than they had before for the same spend. So those are really the three areas I'd point to.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for you, Christian. You touched on some of these in your prepared remarks, but I just wanted to make sure I was clear. So for the 14% -- roughly 14% of ARR and other MSS that is largely Japan. Can you just talk about sort of when that's expected to mostly go to zero? And then relatedly, the magnitude of the duplicative costs and sort of the path for those winding down presumably to zero as well?\nChristian Grant: Yes. Good morning, Saket. Thank you for your question. Yes. So as we talked about -- like when it comes to the remaining 14%, right, with the acceleration in Q1 to the non-Japan other MSS, we got more than half is left in Japan and which we're actively managing down with the expected end of life in Q1 of next year. Well, when it comes to those costs, right, as I mentioned in my remarks, there's about $25 million that is directly tied to the wind down of the other MSS which is split $15 million in cost of service and $10 million of OpEx that we're actively -- we're aligning that and managing as the rundown called the -- that 14% occurs. There's a little bit of timing that will happen as some costs will comes off after the revenue. But the expectation of the -- all those duplicative and transition costs will exit the business by mid-FY '25.\nWendy Thomas: Right. I think that's the thing I'd emphasize, Saket is - two world. Thank you.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham. Mike, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cikos: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. I appreciate you provided the guidance and metrics, but I just wanted to piece out a little bit more around the revenues. With Q1 coming in obviously, below where you guys have expected based on that more active management of other MSS. Is it fair to think that you guys probably tracking towards the lower end of that revenue guidance range we have today? And maybe in conjunction with that response, can you help us think about what needs to go right or what are the vectors that would help you guys come in towards the higher end of that revenue guidance for the reiterated full year guide that we have today?\nWendy Thomas: Good morning, Mike, thanks for that. There are a couple of factors in first quarter. There certainly was and as you recall, the other MSS has two pieces, a handful of larger contracts that were originally extended beyond the non-Japan end-of-life state that we are just working through with those customers for a smooth transition and we were able to accelerate some of that, which is a good thing, and we can align our cost structure accordingly. The second piece was really the transactional consulting revenue, which was more -- those revenues were sold, but the revenue is dependent on customer resourcing to implement those. So think of that more as a timing issue than a sort of permanent issue. And then within the existing Taegis guidance range, we can see the offset of the other MSS piece, which, as I said, the sooner we kind of get to one go-forward business, the more that's good for the overall company.\nMichael Cikos: Got it. Got it. And I know that you guys have spoken about the go-to-market earlier in your prepared remarks as well. And I think Chris had pointed to some of the success you guys continue to see with Taegis ARR coming from, whether it's new customers or upsell or cross-sell. So a two quarter here. But first, maybe for Chris, can you help explain how many of -- I guess, how many customers were added for Taegis in Q1 versus Q4 of last year? And then to Wendy, this is more of a product view here, but can you help us think about the marriage of the IT and OT with respect to the -- I guess, tie up of those environments and where SecureWorks envisions itself playing in that field? Thank you.\nWendy Thomas: Sure. I can hit the product one and then I'll hand it back to Chris to talk about the customer as a kind of a new cross obvious. Majority now that were passed all of the resolutioning outside of the handful that's left. Sure. We're really proud to bring to market these offerings that help unify the security of OT systems for customers. All of you know that we've all seen, right, personally been impacted by industrial companies being impacted by ransomware attacks and their need for unified security, particularly for the systems that generate the majority of their revenue. And our approach to embedding that now into the Taegis platform as those systems, frankly, become much more exposed to the IT side of their house and, of course, are under attack because they're lucrative to attack, this is a great extension of the platform to provide that holistic single pane of glass protection and visibility for customers in a space that we've just seen a lot of growth in, and this is an opportunity to tap into a fast-growing segment of the market. I'll turn it back to you, Chris, in terms of the kind of new cross customers.\nChristian Grant: Yes. So Mike, our quarterly ARR was led by the majority new and cross-sells, which was evenly kind of distributed between the two. ARPC remains on a premium to the market. This is the second quarter in a row where our new customer ARPC is greater than our resolution customers. And then our accounts are rounded. So you lose some of the visibility into the growth happening on the customer base.\nMichael Cikos: Terrific. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Hamza, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Wendy, first one for you. I know it's super early days. But I was wondering, as you talk to customers, how are they thinking about using some of these more advanced AI models as far as their security process is concerned, any applications that you would call out that they're discussing to you about? And then second part was around -- you talked about using AI internally to make the business more efficient. Maybe if you could elaborate on that would be super helpful here.\nWendy Thomas: Sure. It is early days, and this is a sort of a hot topic in terms of do ask customers and they ask us about how we're using AI and how they're seeing it impacting the evolution of their businesses. And the applications are pretty myriad. I mean, they are looking to accelerate anything that is a repeatable type of activity by their team. They are looking to AI to figure out new ways to disintermediate sort of things that are done by humans, Code creation is a great example. Anything around content creation, digital media, there's just a pretty endless list of what they're considering. What we haven't seen is obviously, deep implementation and just much more experimentation right now. So we're kind of keeping a close eye on what that might mean in terms of their security needs. For us, there's really -- talk about two broad brush areas. One is in the platform itself. And we have been using AI from the very beginning and the platform was architected to take advantage the vast training data that we have in place. And so when you think about, we've been using deep learning and machine learning models from the very beginning. The powerful thing for us that's kind of this area is this idea of sort of generative AI to find the unknown, unknown. And I think that's where the real power comes from in terms of security value for customers that were on the curve for and that ability to clearly detect more, detect faster and thereby prevent breaches is an incredible opportunity for us to create more value for customers and beat the adversary.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMadeline Brooks: Hi, team. This is Madeline Brooks on for Tal this morning. Just a few quick ones for me. I guess I want to dive into macro in the opening remarks. I understand that obviously, we have some of the revenue being weighed down by MSS. But I also wanted to just touch on what you're seeing from an economic cycle. And then as we look into the back half of the year, assuming stronger revenue growth for the back half and candidly, across the board, I think our cyber companies over the course of this quarter have try to put in place just more conservative guidance for back half. So what are you guys seeing differently in the market that gives you the confidence that the back half will be stronger for you? Thanks.\nWendy Thomas: Thanks for that. So let me -- I'll just add a little color on the macro environment. For us, as I mentioned, the last three quarters, the third quarter, fourth quarter last year, first quarter of this year, definitely looked a lot different in terms of profile from either the first half of last year, even the year prior, but we didn't see a material shift in customer behavior or potential customer behavior in terms of their scrutiny of deals, which is definitely more elevated and their own attention to their budget, their business. I think it's kind of a continuation of the same. For us, while we, of course, see continued growth in Taegis, our second half inflection in total revenue is more a function of the roll-off and transition of the other MSS business as opposed to us saying there's materially different trajectory in our core business. And you can see that in the Taegis ARR guide. So hopefully, we're in a little bit of a different situation. So hopefully, that color helps.\nMadeline Brooks: Thank you. Just one follow-up to your [technical difficulty] strategic customers year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about where we are in terms of the transition of your existing customer base and maybe out of that 600 [indiscernible] customers were net new?\nWendy Thomas: Sorry, you broke up just a little bit. I'm going to stay back your question, which I think you asked. And if it doesn't hit your questions, and we can hit it on follow-up. I think the first question was around of the 600 customers we added year-over-year. How much -- what percentage were net new versus resolution? And the -- I'd say we're the exact numbers for you? We're about 60-40. I think that's been about consistent in terms of -- obviously, first quarter was a new -- a new customer story as opposed and cross sales, of course, as opposed to resolutioning. And the second question, I don't know if you all heard. Can you maybe try again on the second question?\nMadeline Brooks: Actually, you answered it. So, thank you.\nWendy Thomas: Okay. Great.\nMadeline Brooks: All right.\nWendy Thomas: You're welcome.\nOperator: We currently have no further questions. So I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Toomey for final remarks. Please go ahead.\nKevin Toomey: Thank you. That ends the Q&A on today's call. A replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations page at secureworks.com, along with our Q1 supplemental deck with additional financial tables. Thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."
