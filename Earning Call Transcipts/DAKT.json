As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 28, 2024, and is available on the company's website at www.daktronics.com. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Carla Gatzke, Corporate Secretary for Daktronics, for some introductory remarks. Please go ahead, Carla.\nCarla Gatzke: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. I would like to review our disclosure cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical facts, we will be discussing forward-looking statements reflecting our expectations and plans, about our future financial performance and future business opportunities. These forward-looking statements reflect the company's expectations, or beliefs concerning future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks, and opportunities that could cause actual results, to differ materially from our expectations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and market conditions, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts and orders, fluctuations in margins, the introduction of new products and technology, availability of raw materials, components and shipping services, and other important factors. These identify factors could cause actual results, to differ materially from those discussed in this call in the company's 2024 quarterly earnings release, and in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Our second quarterly 2024 earnings release, contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and was furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K this morning -- clarify, third quarter 2024 earnings release. We also made slides available for today's call. All of these documents are available on the Investors section at Daktronics website, www.daktronics.com. I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Reece Kurtenbach.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thank you, Carla. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. Our third quarter and year-to-date results reflect our team's strong execution of our strategies across all our business areas. These strategies have raised the bar for execution and expectations of profitability in our operating model. As a result, we have delivered record sales and operating income to-date in fiscal 2024, and drove robust operating cash generation in the third quarter. These results serve as evidence, of the success of our past decisive, and deliberate actions taken, to adapt to challenging business conditions, and to improve our customers' experience, while increasing our profitability, and working capital levels. The results also testify, to the resiliency and strength, of our teams within Daktronics and to our strategy, of capturing demand in diversified markets, and innovating across technology platforms. If you have opened the slide deck, I invite you to turn to Slide 3 titled Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Highlights and to follow the financial outcomes for the quarter. To put our fiscal 2024 results delivery into perspective, our third quarter is historically a seasonally low volume quarter, for revenue and therefore, historically could result in a breakeven, or even a loss-making quarter. However, reflecting back to fiscal 2023 third quarter, we fulfilled back-ordered work, as we had new designs available, to take advantage of the available parts in our supply chain, and as other supply chain-related pressures were resolving. This resulted in extraordinarily high volume, and high profit for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023, a unique time for us. During this fiscal year's third quarter, despite a return to more traditional seasonality, and fulfilling a lower volume of orders, as compared to last year's surge, we drove an $8 million profit - operating profit and generated $9 million in operating cash flow. During fiscal Q3, we experienced robust order volume, of $192 million. Live Events in the Commercial business unit, orders strengthened in the quarter, and all domestic markets saw growth. Third quarter orders grew, 29% more than last year's third quarter, bringing year-to-date order growth, to 6.6% for the year. These increases reflect our focus on profitable order generation in our serviceable address available markets or SAM. Backlog continues to decrease from last year's built-up levels, as we recognize the anniversary of the resolution, of supply chain challenges and utilize our capacity, to deliver customer orders at market-expected lead times. With respect to sourcing, our revamped and more diversified supply chains, are functioning well, across our suppliers. As we primarily compete, with companies that obtain their products, from China and compete on price, we continue to evaluate our price position in the market, and are adjusting our prices, to achieve our order attainment goals, at profitable levels. Given our results to-date this year, and the momentum in our order flow, we feel good about our positioning, to drive profitable growth and cash flow generation into the fourth quarter, and beyond. For additional details on the financial results for the quarter, I'll now turn it over to Sheila.\nSheila Anderson: Thank you, Reece. Please turn your attention to Slide 4 titled F Q3, FY 2024 Financial Highlights for the quarterly overview. Orders for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, increased by 29.4%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, through strong demand in the Live Events business unit, returning demand in the spectacular and out-of-home markets in our Commercial business unit and solid growth in High School Park and Recreation and Transportation business units. These higher orders, offset the decline in the International business unit orders, as compared to last year's third quarter. We believe international demand softness, relates to the economic, and geopolitical conditions. We generated sales of $170 million, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to $185 million of sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This 7.9% sales volume declined, as the industry is returning to more traditional seasonal trends, and because during last year's back half of the second quarter, and during the third quarter, the supply chain stabilization, allowed us to physically finish a high volume of orders and deliver, for revenue recognition in those quarters. As Reece highlighted, the third quarter is our historically low sales volume quarter, because of sport seasonality, outdoor construction lulls in the winter months, and fewer workdays due to the holiday breaks. This year's third quarter volume, was as expected. Supply chains, also continued to flow generally as expected. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.5% for the third quarter, of fiscal 2024, as compared to 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The 190 basis point increase in gross profit percentage, is attributable to strategic pricing actions, and stability in our diversified supply chains. Operating margin, was 4.7% of sales, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to last year's 3.8%, or adjusted to 6.3% without the noncash goodwill impairment charge, recorded in last year's quarter three. Fiscal 2024 third quarter's positive operating margin rate, is attributable to our continued careful management of operating expenses. Again, it's notable that we delivered, an $8 million third quarter fiscal 2024, operating profit in our seasonally lowest volume, quarter of the year. Please turn to Slide 5, as I highlight year-to-date performance. Orders for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, increased by 6.6%, as compared to the first nine months, of fiscal 2023, through strong demand in Live Events, Transportation and High School Park and Recreation business units. Commercial orders are down, for the nine months from last year, due to a lack of large project bookings and the reduction in order spend by the out-of-home segment customers in the first six months of the year, partially offset by the third quarter improvement in order placements. International also is down slightly on a nine-month basis. Sales grew 10.6%, for the first nine months, which aligns to the order volume and built up backlog, coming into the first part of the fiscal year. Gross margin as a percent of net sales, increased to 27.7%, for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, as compared to 18.2% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The 950 basis point increase in gross profit percentage, is attributable to our strategic pricing actions, our investments in factory automation, our focus on cost-effective and high-quality product designs, and the stability of our diversified supply chain. After investments in operational areas and organic growth, the resulting operating margin was 11.2% of sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to last year's 0.6%, or 1.4% if that goodwill impairment, was removed from the calculation of non-GAAP calculation, but helpful to compare the improvement. The balance sheet - from a balance sheet perspective, our cash position net of debt increased, due to cash generation from the profitable quarter, and management of working capital. Cash net of debt was $27.2 million, and we generated $53.8 million, of operating cash flow, during the first nine months, because of our profitability and our ability to lower investments in inventory levels, from the height of the supply chain challenges. Our working capital ratio at quarter end, was 2.2, compared to 1.6 at the same time last year. For an update on the market verticals, I'll turn it back over to you, Reece.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thank you, Sheila. Please reference Slide 6 titled Market Verticals Update. Our mission is to support our customers to inform, entertain and persuade their audiences, and their customers. Let's look more specifically into our business areas. In Live Events, we again partnered with the Detroit Tigers, to deliver the second largest main video display in baseball's major leagues at Comerica Park, updating and upgrading our previous installation from 2012. Five additional displays will be installed along the fascia, dug out and line score locations ahead of the 2024 baseball season. Moving forward, we expect Live Events demand, to remain strong as there are a number of projects being bid, as venues enhance facilities, to entertain fans and attract athletes. We see this trend continuing, and more focus being placed on entertainment areas, and the experience outside the bowl, in places like entryways, atriums, concourses and adjacent entertainment areas. Commercial orders, especially from customers in the out-of-home advertising space, can be sensitive to economic conditions, and they can rebound quickly as conditions improve. This market is also sensitive, to the large national advertiser spending decisions, which is why we also focus, on winning other independent billboard sales. We saw a nice order rebound in Q3 in both national and local out-of-home customers. However, large national out-of-home companies, are noting plans to continue, to constrain spending in the coming calendar year. We continue to innovate, and provide competitive differentiation in the marketplace, to reach the needs of our customers. For example, we are seeing interest in our light direct digital billboards. Light direct, narrows the viewing cone of the display, preventing light emissions from spilling into surrounding areas, and targeting only the intended audience in urban and rural environments. We continue to build out our AV integrator network, to market our narrow pixel product lines, especially in control room applications used by military, utility and transportation agencies. Transportation, our teams are focused in winning projects for intelligent transportation systems, as highlighted by fiscal Q3 wins, on projects in Arkansas and Tennessee. International, during the quarter, we won a stadium project and orders for transportation areas, yet orders have been slow this year, which we believe is, due to the economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Customers continue to demonstrate interest in projects, but are delaying buying decisions. Our sales teams, continue to be responsive to customers and are actively quoting opportunities. In high schools, the trend going forward continues to be, conversion to full video. We are well positioned, to meet this demand and believe, we are in the early stages of this transition. We are looking to speed up, and simplify the sales processes, and increase our market reach process, by deploying sales strategies to make certain items available, to be purchased online. We also continue to develop our e-sales channel, and these efforts are going well. We are continuing, to offer more products through these online and partner channels and have improved processes to make the buying process more efficient. From a big picture perspective, our customers use our control capabilities to create, manage and schedule content, for engagement with fans and audiences. We continue to make progress on our multiyear strategy, to create more capabilities, to aid in the service and maintenance of our systems, as well as continually add to the feature set of our cloud-based and locally hosted systems. These capabilities, are increasingly offered through software as a service, and we are investing in people and capabilities to grow these higher margin opportunities. If you would focus on Slide 7, titled Strategic Focus. Overall, our target markets are large, and growing with resilient demand driven, by our customers' desire to improve their audience experience in sports, commercial and transportation environments. More specifically, we are focused on profitable growth, by capturing more of our serviceable available market, or SAM. By expanding the share of customer spend, adding new customers, developing control options, and expanding the services we offer, driving increases in monthly recurring revenues. For example, we are offering frameworks, a content design platform that enables students and staff, the ability to access top-level content, to elevate their brand, for event production and promotions. We're also working, to capture new ways to use in-demand products, such as expanding applications using our indoor narrow pixel pitch product, which are applicable across all of our businesses. For example, we sold additional concourse displays from our NPP product line, to the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field, an existing customer using our traditional products. Internationally, we are driving Live Events, commercial, and transportation opportunities, as the economic conditions continue to improve. And we are focused on developing, and marketing to the military, by attending trade shows, specific to the industry, and growing relationships with AV integrators focused on this market. As we grow revenues, we are working to further increase our nimbleness and flexibility in capacity allocation and utilization. We are investing over the coming fiscal years, and improvements in our demand planning tools and alignment to capacity, for integrated business planning and our expanding factory qualifications to have flexibility for where a product is built, to maximize the use of our infrastructure. And dynamically aligning capacity, to adjust to seasonality, and varying order flow by market. Turning to Slide 8 on Slide 9, we are - we appreciate the feedback and questions that we received from our shareholders and wanted to take this opportunity to address some of the questions most frequently asked. First, we are often asked why we don't give guidance today. As you know, our demand is project driven and therefore, can be lumpy. Demand is also highly seasonal, and additionally, demand can be impacted by customers and construction schedules, all making it difficult to give precise estimates for the future. What we can say today is that, over the next three to five years, we are working to drive sales growth, with our sights on $1 billion of annual revenue, and operating margin sustainability in the mid to upper end of the 5% to 10% range as we move forward. We are investing in processes and systems to increase our level of control, over the controllable elements of our business. This work is expected, to increase our ability to be responsive, to changing conditions, as we grow in an increasingly complex global marketplace. By taking these actions, our goal is to raise our visibility in, as I mentioned, a lumpy seasonal business and enhance our internal planning capabilities. It is important to note - that as we look more on an annual perspective, in order to identify prevailing trends in our businesses, and plan accordingly while maintaining, as much flexibility as possible. We will continue to reevaluate, our guidance practices over time to help our investors understand our outlook. Investors also ask, what is our capital allocation strategy? We historically plan around 5% of sales in research, and development expenses, and roughly 3% of sales, on average in capital spending, to maintain our technology leadership, manage and maintain our manufacturing capacity, information system infrastructure, and sales demonstration equipment. We also look for opportunistic acquisitions that, can help us advance our technologies, penetrate new geographies, or help expand our serviceable addressable market. Going forward, as we increase our sustainability and cash flow generation, we could consider repayment of our debt, and we may also consider the resumption of quarterly dividends and/or share repurchases. Turning to Slide 9. Finally, we want to reiterate that our Board has aligned management's compensation structure with investors' priorities for profitable growth. Specifically, the incentive compensation program is based on operating income as our key metric with targets of 10%. The strategies we described previously, are designed to help us move towards that achievement, capturing profitable SAM, developing best-in-class solutions and managing expenses. Maximizing our utilization and increasingly - increasing the agility of our manufacturing capacity and automation, through our systems and processes, are keys to managing expenses. Turning to fiscal Q4, 2024 qualitative outlook. I encourage you to reference Slide 10. Given what we see in our businesses today, we anticipate our fiscal fourth quarter seasonality, to be similar to pre-pandemic patterns, which is historically an increase in revenue and profitability, as compared to the third quarter. While we are not offering a quantitative outlook, qualitatively, we look for fiscal 2024 fourth quarter net sales to increase sequentially, and decrease from the year ago period, which was again a high-volume period in, which we were fulfilling back orders, related to the pandemic recovery. We are positioned for continued sequential margin and cash flow generation. In conclusion, our summary on Slide 11 recaps our key highlights. Our year-to-date results, offer evidence that we have overcome the challenges caused, by the constrained supply chain, and pandemic implications of recent years. We enjoy our position, as a global industry leader in best-in-class video communication systems. We are the technology leader in our industry and are the only U.S. manufacturer of scale, with a global footprint. What differentiates us from our competitors is our U.S. base, our technology leadership, the high quality of our solutions, our high-touch service and our large entrenched customer base. Our target markets, are large and growing, with resilient demand driven, by audience experience, sports fan engagement, and customer success with our systems. We are focused on a multiyear journey, to capture the growth in existing SAM, and in other areas. This poises us for sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flows. We are very proud of, our results and grateful to our teams, who work together to deliver them, and we look forward, to a solid end to the year. With that, I would ask the operator, to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from BJ Cook with Singular Research. Your line is open.\nBJ Cook: Hi, thanks for taking my question, guys. New order growth was quite a bright spot for the quarter. Interestingly, last quarter, there were higher orders in International and Transportation, decrease in Commercial. This quarter was quite the opposite. I know results can kind of be choppy, but is there anything unique that you're seeing in those segments, given the jump in new orders?\nReece Kurtenbach: BJ, first of all, I appreciate the question. Thanks for joining us this morning. And I think what you're seeing is, as we described here, lumpiness, we - International and Transportation tends to be large order based and that order books in a certain period, and then it fulfills in the subsequent periods. And so, I think what you're seeing, is a normal kind of impact of our business, which is why we tend to look, over larger periods, to kind of smooth some of that out.\nBJ Cook: Great. Thanks. You guys mentioned in your remarks, some new sources of revenue and SaaS, or recurring revenue in military as well. Can you expand on those? Or how far along in the sales process, are you in those different opportunities?\nReece Kurtenbach: Certainly, our - what we call our narrow pixel pitch product, has really matured into a nice line of different pixel pitches in different ways that our customers can use them. And the AP integrator reseller chain that we sell a lot of that through, continues to grow and be developed. Some of - but there's still room to continue to add AV integrators and build our visibility in that market space. On the software as a system and some of these other content services, we see great potential in those areas, but relatively new. We're adding customers in those areas, but really in the past 12 to 18 months that has started.\nBJ Cook: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it\nReece Kurtenbach: Thanks, BJ.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anja Soderstrom with Sidoti. Your line is open.\nAnja Soderstrom: Hi, and thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good progress here. I'm just curious with the backlog declining. I understand that's, due to catch-up from last year a supply chain. But when do you think that will revert, to seeing growth again?\nReece Kurtenbach: Our backlog is going to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, Anja, as we book these large orders and then kind of work them off. We believe, though, that our - a year ago, our backlog was too large. We had a lot of product in there, and we weren't able to meet market lead times. And so, we see the reduction year-over-year in backlog as a positive as we've got our delivery more into market lead times. But I would also say that as we talked about seasonality, our fiscal Q1 and Q2, tend to be our largest revenue quarters. And so, we would expect backlog to grow, somewhat as we go into that period, and then shrink as we go into Q3. And then grow again, as we would come back into the next fiscal year, as we've - just over time, experienced that seasonality in and out. Is that helpful Anja?\nAnja Soderstrom: Yes, that was helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of the gross margin is fluctuating quite a bit as well. What is sort of a sensible one to use going forward for projections?\nReece Kurtenbach: Revenue growth is the...\nAnja Soderstrom: The gross margins?\nReece Kurtenbach: Gross margins. I think we're going to see a stabilization in our gross margins as the business environment just isn't as volatile, as it was a year or so ago. Where does that all settle out is a good question, Anja. We believe that we certainly are enjoying these gross margins, and we're very sensitive to pricing adjustments and cost increases. And we're fighting, to hold those gross margins quarter-after-quarter. As far as guidance on what gross margins would, or could be, I don't think we're ready, to give that at this time.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay. Thank you. That was all from me.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thank you, Anja\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Reece for any closing remarks.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to thank everyone for attending our conference call today. I would like to let you know that, we are appearing at the Sidoti Small Cap Conference in March, and we often have one-on-ones following the conference call. And we'll host the next earnings call likely in June, as we release our annual results. I hope you all have a great day, and a great week, and thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, December 5, 2023, and is available on the company's website at www.daktronics.com. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sheila Anderson, Chief Financial Officer for Daktronics, for some introductory remarks. Please go ahead, Sheila.\nSheila Anderson: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. I would like to review our disclosure cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical facts, we will be discussing forward-looking statements reflecting our expectations and plans about our future financial performance and future business opportunities. These forward-looking statements reflect the company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and market conditions, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts and orders, fluctuations in margins, the introductions of new products and technologies, availability of raw materials, components and shipping services and other important factors. These identified factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this call in the company's 2024 quarterly earnings release and its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Our second quarter 2024 earnings release contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that was furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a Form 8-K this morning. These documents are available on the Investors section at Daktronics website at www.daktronics.com. I'll turn the call over now to our CEO, Reece Kurtenbach.\nReece Kurtenbach: Good morning. Thank you, Sheila. Thanks, everybody out there for joining us today. We have had a record start to fiscal year 2024 in both sales and operating income and had robust operating cash generation for the quarter. All of this is the result of strong execution in our strategic strategies across all our business areas. We continue to benefit from our past decisive and deliberate actions to improve our customers' experience while increasing our profitability and working capital levels. Our performance is also a testimony to the resiliency and strength of our teams within Daktronics as well as our strategy of diversified markets and innovation across technology platforms. For additional details on the financial results for the quarter, I'll turn it back to Sheila.\nSheila Anderson: Thank you, Reece. As Reece mentioned, we had a record start for orders and operating income and strong operating cash flows. Congratulations to the Daktronics team for this great effort. For the quarter and year, orders and demand outlook remained strong in Live Events, High School Park and Recreation and Transportation as we see customers continue to invest in digital displays to inform, entertain and persuade their audiences. International orders have been increasing this year as global economies recover from the pandemic despite more related events. For fiscal 2024, commercial areas have been contracted for orders and out-of-home digital billboard and the military areas. As a reminder, given the impact of large tailored projects across our markets, orders can be lumpy. We reported sales of $199.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This was an increase of 6.4% compared to $187.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales growth was driven by fulfilling orders in backlog. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 27.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to 16.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The over 10-point increase in gross profit percentage is attributable to the increased sales volume over our relatively fixed cost structure, strategic pricing actions and a stable supply chain causing fewer operational disruptions during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to a year earlier. Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $34.8 million compared to $30.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses for the quarter over prior year was 17.4% as compared to 16.1%. On a year-to-date basis, operating expenses as a percent of sales was 15.2% as compared to 17.1%. Both gross profit and operating expenses were impacted by a $4.8 million of expenses related to the effects of our employee benefit programs, $3.4 million related to the establishments or estimate adjustments for these programs. We believe these programs are valuable and promote higher employee retention. Operating income was $19.4 million or 9.7% of sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to last year's $1.5 million or 0.8%. And as a reminder, our business also fluctuates seasonally based on the sports markets and construction cycles, and is dependent on the varied schedules of our customers' needs. Generally, the first half of the year, we have stronger quarters, Q3 is softer because of the seasonality and reduced work days for the holidays, and Q4 starts to ramp back up for the sports and outdoor deliveries. The low operating income, we accounted for our convertible debt at fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. For the second quarter, we recorded $10.7 million non-cash charge. This fair value change was primarily caused by the increase in our stock price over the conversion price and the slight decline in market interest rates. Going forward, we will remeasure the fair value of this convertible notes until maturity or conversion happens, which will create this non-cash charge below operating income each quarter. Tax expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $4 million with an effective income tax rate of 64.8%. Absent any major tax changes, we expect our full-year effective rate to be in the mid-20s before the non-cash, non-tax impact of the fair value accounting for the convertible debt. Our balance sheet reflects the changes in business levels and strategies we pursued in managing our supply chain and growing our capability to meet our customers' commitments while managing our liquidity. At the end of the fiscal 2024 second quarter, our working capital ratio was 2:1. Inventory levels dropped slightly since the end of our fiscal year in April 29, 2023, and are expected to approach more normalized levels of supply chain disruptions continue to ease and our order backlog is fulfilled. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $73.5 million and we have face value of debt of $39.6 million outstanding. There were no drawdowns on our line of credit. Through higher income from operations and strong working capital management, we drove second quarter fiscal 2024 cash generation to $25.1 million from operations and we used $4.7 million for the purchase of property and equipment. Income from operations and working capital management contributed to that cash generation. Our plans are to spend approximately $19 million for capital assets, primarily in manufacturing and technology areas in total for fiscal 2024. We also planned investments in digitalization to improve customer and employee experiences and will continue to invest in our affiliates through the year. Over the long-term, we remain focused on driving profitable growth. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 is $307 million, which provides a nice pace of business to fulfill in the coming quarters. The reduction in backlog from last year and last quarter reflects our focus to reduce lead times with capacity increases we've made over the past year, and it was also aided by the continued stability in the supply chain. I'll now turn it back over to you, Reece.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thank you, Sheila. As we look ahead, industry research predicts the LED market will achieve an estimated 20% to 25% compounded annual growth rate over the coming years, depending on the specific end market and geography considered. We are well positioned to continue to capitalize on growth in the global use of audio visual communication systems in both traditional and new applications, and we remain focused on engaging in a full range of activities to serve our customers by providing high-quality standard display products as well as custom-designed integrated systems, both with ongoing services and support. Manufacturing a complete line of products from small scoreboards and electronic displays to large multimillion-dollar video display systems and the related control and sound systems, developing capabilities to design, manufacture, install and service, complete integrated systems and we are recognized as a technical leader in these areas, generating new leads and serve repeat customers based on our performance, reputation and marketing efforts. As we look ahead to the remainder of the current fiscal year, our attention remains focused on our multiyear journey to capture the market's expected growth and broaden our leading market position by offering best-in-class technologies and services to both our traditional customers as well as new and adjacent markets. As we look into the second half of fiscal 2024, we are applying the experience we gained over the last two fiscal years and intend to closely monitor the ever-evolving geopolitical and global economic environment and as necessary, quickly adjust our resources and market approaches so that we can maintain profitability and cash generation throughout various cycles. In our business areas, we are focused on growth opportunities over the long-term. These include our High School Park and Recreation business unit to grow through the adoption of video displays for sporting and educational use. These customers are deploying more Daktronics professional-grade technology and sophisticated content increasing the total addressable market. In the commercial area, while in FY2024, our orders were down because of market conditions, we expect growth over the long-term. We are focused on increasing sales channels with audiovisual integrators for end use in government, military, healthcare and corporate applications, which will create growth in this business area. In addition, customers depending on out-of-home advertising or self-promotion, use our products and services as an effective medium for both indoor and outdoor applications. We expect existing and new customers to purchase displays to install in new locations as well as replacement displays for existing locations to capitalize on the effectiveness of digital technologies. Transportation demand is strong as project planning and approval activities resume to more pre-pandemic levels, and our customers move forward in purchasing displays used for intelligent transportation systems and for mass transit venues. Infrastructure spending should continue to benefit this segment as digital signage is often used in these projects, and we are qualified to do business in all U.S. states. In the International business unit, we continue to experience a softer market due to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. We expect to see these factors to continue to impact sales in the coming year. We are closely watching developments and can adjust resources and commitments accordingly. Over the longer term, we expect similar growth trends in the commercial and transportation areas outside the U.S. We also expect sports venue projects to continue to be a focus in our marketing efforts. The Live Events segment outlook remains strong due to large stadium renovations, continued replacement cycles and expansion of sales efforts beyond the sports competition areas, which we would call in the ball. We are the acknowledged market leader in this segment, which allows us to be strategic in our pricing and contract terms while being very mindful about the profitability of this segment. In FY2024, we are making investments in high-return projects and technologies to support long-term profitability. Our experience in engineering, process design, service design and product development capabilities and investments made in affiliated customers are very important factors in continuing to develop, produce and offer the most up-to-date digital displays and control system solutions desired by the market. We will continue to invest in our development efforts and our affiliated customers to release differentiated product platforms, software offerings and support services. We will also advance critical architecture and design in the new competitive narrow pixel pitch and micro LED technologies, sustainable technologies, software architecture and other related areas. We also plan to expand our operational efficiency by focusing on retention of our highest performing team members and capitalizing on automation capabilities added over the last year. We will invest in digital transformation projects and other automation that will support improved customer and employee experiences and lower cost to operate. Our goal is to sustain the improved results and continue to drive profitable growth over the long-term. With that, I would ask the operator to please open the line for any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of BJ Cook from Singular Research.\nBJ Cook: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Just a few quick questions here. Looks like gross margin was down slightly from Q1. I guess still working through some inflationary cost pressures? Or is this kind of more of a return to normalized gross margin?\nReece Kurtenbach: Yes, BJ, first of all, thanks for joining us this morning. As Sheila mentioned in her comments, we do have a fixed cost infrastructure with our factories and other areas. So as revenue might fluctuate through the quarter-to-quarter, you might see a change in the measured gross profit, even though our pricing and other cost structures have remained similar. And so we think we still have a strong backlog of good orders, and we believe that we're set up for success for the rest of the fiscal year over the long-term and for the long-term with both our backlog as well as the ordering activity that we're seeing. So we're not thinking that's a long – we are thinking that’s part of our business over the long-term. That's not some sort of a change in how our market pricing or order taking is going.\nBJ Cook: All right. Thanks, Reece. One more. You mentioned a great quarter in terms of cash generation, got a healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet. Just wondering if paying down the mortgages on your radar or if there's other uses for that cash that you guys are considering?\nReece Kurtenbach: Yes, certainly, that's always a discussion with our Board, but there's different ways that we could choose to use that cash and paying down debt is one of those. I think we'll see that those strategies become visible here in the coming quarters.\nBJ Cook: Okay. Cool. I’ll appreciate it.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thank you. Appreciate the questions and the participation.\nBJ Cook: Of course.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference back over to Reece Kurtenbach for closing remarks.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thank you, everybody, for attending our conference call today. We are appearing in the Noble Capital and Singular conferences over the next few days, and we'll host the next conference call when our third quarter results are released later this Spring. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season. Appreciate your participation in today's call, and we'll talk to you in the quarter. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, September 6, and is available on the company’s website at www.daktronics.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sheila Anderson, Chief Financial Officer for Daktronics, for some introductory remarks. Please go ahead, Sheila.\nSheila Anderson: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I would like to review our disclosure cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical facts, we will be discussing forward-looking statements reflecting our expectations and plans about our future financial performance and future business opportunities. These forward-looking statements reflect the company’s expectations or beliefs concerning future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and market conditions, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts and orders, fluctuations in margins, the introductions of new products and technologies, availability of raw materials, components and shipping services and other important factors. These identified factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed on this call in our company’s first quarter 2024 earnings release and its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Our first quarter 2024 earnings release contain certain non-GAAP financial measures and was furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K this morning. These documents are available on the Investors section at Daktronics website at www.daktronics.com. I’ll turn the call over to our CEO, Reece Kurtenbach.\nReece Kurtenbach: Good morning. Thanks, Sheila. I’d like to thank all of you for joining us today. Our record sales and operating income for the quarter are a result of strong execution across all our business areas. We continue to benefit from our past decisive and deliberate actions to improve our customers’ experience while increasing our profitability and working capital levels. Our performance is also a testimony to the resiliency and strength of our teams within Daktronics as well as our strategy of diversified markets and innovation across technology platforms. Our teams strategically utilized our capacity to complete the manufacturing and installation for the start of fall football season for our High School Park and Recreation and Live Events customers. Numerous high schools and colleges turned on Daktronics displays this football season. Several professional sports stadiums also trusted Daktronics value and have new installations, including the Green Bay Packers, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots. With our sales performance, we also were able to bring lead times back down towards pre-pandemic levels and generate profits. For additional details on the financial results for the quarter, I’ll turn it over to Sheila.\nSheila Anderson: Thank you, Reece. As Reece mentioned, we had a record start for orders and operating income in the quarter. We had sales of $232.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This was an increase of 35.3% compared to $171.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales growth was driven by fulfilling orders and backlog, especially in the Live Events and High School Park and Rec business areas, as Reece mentioned. The increase is attributable to a stable operating environment, increased manufacturing capacity and realization of price increases. What a difference a year makes as in comparison during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 we experienced multiple material supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and a pandemic related shutdown in our facilities in Shanghai, China for a significant portion of that quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to 15% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage is attributable to the record sales volume over our cost structure, strategic pricing actions and fewer supply chain and operational disruptions during this quarter as compared to last year at the same time. Operating expenses for the first quarter were $30.9 million compared to $31.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses for the quarter over prior year quarter declined 13.3% from the 18.2%. Operating income was $40.2 million or 17.3% of sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to last year’s loss of $5.5 million. Tax expense for the first quarter was $8.9 million with an effective income tax rate of 31.7%. Absent any major tax changes, we expect our full year effective rate to be in the mid-20s before the noncash, nontax impact with fair value accounting of our convertible debt. Our balance sheet reflects the changes in business levels and strategies we pursued in managing our supply chain and growing our capacity to meet customers’ commitments, all while managing our liquidity. At the end of fiscal 2024 first quarter, our working capital ratio was 1.9:1. Inventory levels dropped slightly since the end of the year and are expected to approach more normalized levels. The supply chain disruptions continue to ease and order backlog is fulfilled. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $54.9 million, and we have a face value of debt of $40 million outstanding. There were no drawdowns on our line of credit. As a reminder, we closed on our financing in May 2023 as a result of the comprehensive review of financing alternatives, led by the Board’s strategy and financing review committee. This new debt structure provides us the financial resources to serve our customers and build long-term value for our shareholders. The interest expense created by this debt also includes the debt issuance cost of the convertible debt. The convertible debt is recorded at fair value, and we recorded a $7.3 million noncash charge because of the change in the fair value, and that fair value was primarily caused by the increase in our stock price and decline in market interest rates. Going forward, we will remeasure the fair value of this convertible note until maturity or conversion, which will create this noncash charge below operating income each quarter. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we generated $19.3 million of cash from operations and used $4.5 million for purchases of property and equipment. We continue to focus on optimizing our working capital for investments and for investments into working capital assets. Our plans are to spend approximately $19 million for capital assets, primarily in manufacturing and technology areas. We also plan investments in digitization to improve customer and employee experiences, and we’ll continue to invest in our affiliates through this year. Over the long term, we expect to grow revenues and profitably. Our backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was at $324 million, which provides a nice base of business to fulfill in the coming quarters. And the reduction of backlog reflects the stabilization of our supply chain and our ability to return to more customer anticipated lead times. I’ll now turn it back over to you, Reece for more comments.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thanks, Sheila. As we look ahead, we expect growth in the global use of audiovisual communication systems in both traditional and new applications. Industry research predicts the LED market will achieve an estimated 20% compounded annual growth rate over the coming years, depending on the specific end market and geography. We are poised to capitalize on this growth by continuing to do things we do well, including how we engage in a full range of activities to serve our customers by providing high-quality standard display products as well as custom-designed integrated systems, both with ongoing services and support. We manufacture a complete line of products from small scoreboards and electronic displays to large multimillion-dollar video display systems and the related control and sound systems. We developed capabilities to design, manufacture, install and service, complete integrated systems, and we are recognized as a technical leader in these areas. We generate new leads and serve repeat customers based on our performance, reputation and marketing efforts. As we look ahead to the remainder of the current fiscal year, our attention remains focused on our multiyear journey to capture the market’s expected growth and broaden our leading market position by offering best-in-class technologies and services to both our traditional customers as well as new and adjacent markets. We have applied the experience of the preceding two fiscal years to closely monitor the ever-evolving geopolitical and global economic environment and as necessary, quickly adjust our resources and market approaches so that we can maintain profitability and cash generation throughout various cycles. As we evaluate our business areas, we continue to expect the following over the long term with some natural volatility in size and timing of orders across fiscal periods. We expect our High School Park and Recreation business unit to grow through adoption of video displays for sporting and educational use. These customers are deploying more Daktronics professional-grade technology and sophisticated content increasing the total addressable market. In the Commercial area, we are focused on increasing sales channels with audiovisual integrators for end use in government, military, health care and corporate applications, which will create growth in this business area. In addition, customers depending on out-of-home advertising or self-promotion use our products and services as an effective medium for both indoor and outdoor applications. We expect existing and new customers to purchase displays to install in new locations as well as replacement displays for existing locations to capitalize on the effectiveness of digital technologies. Transportation demand is strong as project planning and approval activities resume to more pre-pandemic levels, and our customers move forward in purchasing displays used for intelligent Transportation systems and for mass transit venues. Infrastructure spending should continue to benefit this segment as digital signage is often used in these projects, and we are qualified to do business in all U.S. states. In the International business unit, we continue to experience a softer market due to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. We expect to see these factors to continue to impact sales in the coming year. We are watching developments closely and have and can adjust resources and commitments accordingly. Over the longer term, we expect similar growth trends in the Commercial and Transportation areas outside the U.S.. We also expect continued interest in sports venue projects, and these will be a focus in our marketing efforts. The Live Events segment outlook remains strong due to large stadium renovations, continued replacement cycles and expansion of sales efforts beyond sports efforts areas. We are the acknowledged market leader in this segment, which allows us to be strategic in our pricing and contract terms while being very mindful about the profitability of this business. In FY ‘24, we will make investments in high-return projects and technologies to support long-term profitability. Our experience in engineering, process design, service design and product development capabilities and investments made in affiliated companies are very important factors in continuing to develop, produce and offer the most up-to-date digital displays and control system solutions desired by the market. We will continue to invest in our development efforts and our affiliated companies to release differentiated product platforms, software offerings and support services. We will also advance critical architecture and design in new competitive narrow pixel pitch and micro LED technologies, sustainable technologies, software architecture and other related areas. We also plan to grow our operational efficiency by focusing on retention of our highest performing team members and capitalization on automation capabilities added over the last years. We will invest in digital transformation project automation that will support improved customer and employee experiences and lower cost to operate. We believe the stage is set for a strong fiscal 2024 and look forward to continued growth of sales and expansion of operating income. With that, I would ask the operator to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of BJ Cook with Singular Research.\nBJ Cook: Hello, can you guys hear me?\nReece Kurtenbach: Yes, we can.\nBJ Cook: Awesome. Thanks. Thanks for taking the call. Nice quarter. It looks like gross margins turned out really great from a historical perspective. Can we attribute that to continued improved pricing actions on your backlog? And it seems like inflation is teamed to be here in the short term. Are new orders going to reflect a more historical lower gross margin? I guess, in other words, is your higher gross margin sustainable?\nReece Kurtenbach: Yes, I think the -- well, first of all, we’re very pleased with the gross profit margin in the last quarter. And as you alluded to, we believe a lot of that is due to the current pricing structure, but also in the smoothness of operations as the supply chain has really become more predictable this year over last year at this time. As far as inflationary pressures, it still seems like there’s inflationary pressures out there, but not as dynamic or maybe as extreme. And certainly, the stabilization of the supply chain makes all of this more predictable. As we complete the bulge of work that was available after the pandemic, I suspect we will see some return to a more competitive environment. But as a company, we’re very sensitive to these inflationary pressures and really the dynamics in the marketplace is today. And so we’re very carefully evaluating each opportunity in each market to understand what the competitive nature of that business might be.\nBJ Cook: Got it. Awesome. Similarly, operation -- operating margin was fantastic, too. I know just one quarter that we’re looking at and some of that was due to the gross margin. But it seemed like you supported a notably higher amount of revenue with similar operating expenses compared to first quarter last year. So I guess a similar question, is this reflective of your operational improvements filtering through the P&L? Again, is this sustainable cost structure going forward?\nReece Kurtenbach: Yes. We believe that we were able to ship that much product, first of all, because we’ve invested and installed and put into place a lot of automation equipment in the past 18 months. And the teams that are responsible for those systems have had an ample of time to improve and understand the operations of those. We’ve also increased our staffing levels greatly over the past 12 to 18 months and also have a more stable workforce that understands how to -- the products and what they’re expected or what we would like them to do. So I think we have an understanding of what we can deliver. Now can we keep a stable backlog in place into the future quarters and consistently keep all of those fulfillment areas running at a high level will be the management team’s focus over the coming quarters.\nBJ Cook: Okay. A couple of questions on the debt structure. Is the -- can you pay the mortgage without prepayment penalty? If so, is that your intention in the long term? I mean I’m sure that comes with the caveat that working capital and CapEx is secure?\nSheila Anderson: We are able, BJ, to repay that mortgage at any time. And as the management team and our Board reviews the outlook, we’ll be evaluating the use of that cash and working to put it to use for different opportunities to invest it back in the company or like you mentioned, we could prepay.\nBJ Cook: So can you remind us what would trigger the conversion of the debt? It looks like the stock has been over the conversion price for a while, but it hasn’t converted yet. Do you have force conversion rates? I think so. Could you remind us about that situation?\nSheila Anderson: We do have a term of force conversion, but that doesn’t come into effect until 18 months from May of 2023. And then it’s that certain tranches we can force conversion. And the stock price that’s also be over 150% of that $6.31 conversion price.\nBJ Cook: Awesome. Just one last quick one, assuming it’s probably too early for guidance or too soon. Is there anything you can share about how you guys -- your outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year? It seems like there is a small reduction in orders year-over-year. The press release noticed that -- noted that, that was in the -- the big bugaboo was Commercial segment. Anything you can share there?\nReece Kurtenbach: We don’t typically give guidance, so that is, we’re still on that track. And in the Commercial business area, the out-of-home business tends to be the most sensitive to economic factors. As you might recall, in the next -- last 9 months, there is this, are we going to have a recession? Are we going to have a soft landing? It seems like the press or the pool of experts out there are getting more optimistic that this might be a soft landing, which would bode well for that business segment typically.\nSheila Anderson: And just to highlight, too, BJ, there is some variability in our larger project business in the Commercial market, what we call the spectacular business area. So there can be ups and downs in that and when you compare one quarter to the other. And that just causes some variability in that level of sales -- or, excuse me, level of orders.\nBJ Cook: Yes. Okay, it seems like involved. That’s fine. All right. That’s it for me. Thanks, guys. I appreciate your time.\nSheila Anderson: Thank you.\nReece Kurtenbach: Thanks, BJ.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I’m showing no further questions in queue at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Reece Kurtenbach for closing remarks.\nReece Kurtenbach: Well, I appreciate everybody attending today’s conference call and the questions and any other feedback we will receive. We will host the next conference call when our second quarter results are released and I look forward to talking to you all again then. Thanks, everyone. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
