There is also a slide deck summarizing our financial results in the Investors Section of our website. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the following commentary is made on a continuing operations basis. With that I will turn the call over to Fred.\nFred Brightbill: Thank you, Bobby, and good morning, everyone. Our business performed well during the second quarter as we delivered better-than-expected results despite continuing macroeconomic uncertainty in a highly competitive retail environment. Near term, we remain focused on rebalancing dealer inventories with anticipated demand to ensure the health of our dealer network. Despite near-term challenges, our portfolio of consumer-centric brands, a highly variable cost structure and our strong balance sheet provide us with the confidence to continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives. In addition to maintaining a resilient balance sheet and investing for the future, our disciplined approach to capital allocation allows us the flexibility to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program, regarding the economic outlook are mixed and uncertain, which is limiting retail demand visibility. Recently, we observed some relatively positive indications that favor cautious optimism, including the expectation for lower interest rates, improving consumer sentiment and unexpectedly strong GDP growth. We continue to monitor retail results and assess the overall business and economic environment. We are confident that our flexible operating model will allow us to mitigate near-term risk and capitalize on the upside when we return to growth. Although inventories modestly increased during the quarter, seasonal increase was less than typical in pre-COVID periods. We prioritized pipeline rebalancing and dealer health as we enter fiscal 2024. Other industry participants are now signaling softening demand while pairing their expectations significantly in some cases. We believe the decisive action we took to right-size our production plan from the start of fiscal 2024 has allowed us to transition to a more historical pattern of inventory build and destock. Dealer inventory units normally increased to a relative peak during our fiscal third quarter before declining throughout the summer selling season. While dealer inventories remain higher than we consider optimum, we expect levels to improve by the end of the fiscal year. As other industry participants begin to react to lower demand, the retail environment has become increasingly competitive. Dealers continue to focus on destocking to manage inventory levels and reduce floorplan costs. The resulting increase in promotional activity is pressuring margins across the industry. Results from early boat shows are mixed. although many of the way shows have exceeded expectations. We anticipate that retail activity will support our range of wholesale expectations. The environment is very competitive as inventory availability has improved providing consumers with more choices. The good news is that there are buyers. However, a general lack of urgency is contributing to increased promotional activity. Our dealer inventory levels and production plans position our dealers to capitalize on the remaining boat shows in the upcoming summer selling season. We expect to have a clear picture of retail demand as we progress through our third and fourth quarters. Despite the cyclical headwinds facing the industry, we are well-positioned to pursue our capital allocation priorities, including investment in long-term growth. We are prudently investing in targeted initiatives that will take advantage of the industry's positive underlying secular trends. I will briefly discuss one such initiative as I review the operational results of our brands. With our financial position secured and our current strategic growth initiatives fully funded, we expect to continue to allocate most of our free cash flow for the year to our EPS accretive share repurchase program. Our balance sheet and capital allocation framework provides us with flexibility to adjust our stance from cautious to optimistic, depending on our view of the cycle. Given the currently suppressed marine environment, and near-term uncertainty, we will remain opportunistic in our approach to grow through M&A. Let me now briefly review some of the latest developments across our brands. Our MasterCraft brand, net sales were $73 million for the quarter, down 33% from the record prior year period. The decrease in net sales was in line with our expectations given the planned production decrease to rebalance dealer inventories in response to lower retail demand. MasterCraft team is actively supporting our dealer partners at boat shows occurring across the country and globally. MasterCraft performed particularly well at the Atlanta, Seattle and Salt Lake City shows. At Crest, net sales were $17 million for the quarter, down 54% from the prior year period as expected due to a pullback in production to align with retail demand. Early boat show results have been mixed, but encouraging as consumer interest in pontoons has been better than anticipated. However, consumers lack a sense of urgency and the sales cycle is taking longer than expected in the last few years. Press performed particularly well as Minneapolis show, the largest pontoon market in the U.S., along with the Chicago, Atlanta and Detroit shows. On the strategic front, we will be launching a new pontoon brand for model year 2025 that will be built in our Crest facility. This new brand was conceived through our consumer-centric approach to strategic planning and we'll be focused on targeting affluent customer with an elevated on-water and in water experience. We will be launching the brand consumers in the spring and look forward to sharing more information on this exciting growth initiative with investors on our next earnings call. At Aviara, net sales were $10 million for the quarter down 30% compared to the prior year period. During the quarter, Aviara was focused on the ramp-up of the all-new AV28, an impressive product platform consisting of 4 distinct model variants. We expect the AV28 production to continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. Aviara has also expanded its distribution network by adding 8 new domestic and international points of distribution fiscal year-to-date. Social results for Aviara have been mixed, but we are encouraged by the results of some shows, including New York and Seattle. We recently hired Michael Connell, a 30-year industry veteran to be President of Aviara. Mike's senior leadership roles at several bunk manufacturers gives him a wealth of experience and knowledge that he will leverage to improve Aviara's operational performance and execute its growth strategy. I will now turn the call over to Tim, who will provide a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Tim?\nTim Oxley: Thanks, Fred. Focusing on the top line, net sales for the quarter were $99.5 million, a decrease of $59.7 million or 38% from the record prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to lower unit sales volume and an increase in dealer incentives partially offset by higher prices and favorable mix. Dealer incentives include higher floor plan financing costs as a result of increased dealer inventories and interest rates, and other incentives as the retail environment remains very competitive. For the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 18.8%, a decrease of 520 basis points when compared to the prior year period. Lower margins were the result of lower cost absorption due to planned decreased production volume, higher dealer incentives and higher costs related to material labor and overhead inflation partially offset by higher prices. Operating expenses were relatively consistent for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. In pursuit of growth initiatives, we continue to invest in product development and marketing. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted net income for the year decreased to $6.3 million or $0.37 per diluted share, computed using estimated annual effective tax rate of 22%. This compares to adjusted net income of $21.3 million or $1.20 for the prior year period, computed using that tax rate of 23%. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $9.8 million for the quarter compared to $29.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.8%, down 890 basis points from 18.7% in the prior year period. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong as we ended the quarter with nearly $209 million of total liquidity, including nearly $109 million of cash and short-term investments and $100 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with no debt as cash and short-term investments exceed our outstanding debt balance. Year-to-date, we have generated more than $19 million of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet positions us exceptionally well and provides us with ample financial flexibility to ensure sound operations through the business cycle and the ability to fund strategic growth initiatives. During the quarter, we spent approximately $4.4 million to repurchase more than 214,000 shares of our common stock. Since initiating our share repurchase program in June of 2021, we spent more than $58 million to repurchase over 2.3 million shares. These cumulative repurchases provided a 13% benefit for our fiscal second quarter adjusted net income per share. We expect to continue to return cash to shareholders while prioritizing financial flexibility and high return investments in the business that generate growth and long-term shareholder value. Looking forward, we are narrowing our guidance range for the full year. Consolidated net sales is now expected to be between $400 million and $412 million with adjusted EBITDA between $42 million and $47 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.53 and $1.78. We also now expect cash flow expenditures to be approximately $20 million for the full year. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, consolidated net sales is expected to be approximately $92 million with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $7 million and adjusted earnings per share were approximately $0.23. Although our guidance reflects a significant decline in earnings from fiscal 2023, we expect to generate positive free cash flow, which is a testament to our flexible, highly variable cost structure and proactive cost control efforts. I'll now turn the call back to Fred for his closing remarks.\nFred Brightbill: Thanks, Tim. As we continued our focus on rebalancing dealer inventories, our business performed well during the second quarter by delivering better-than-expected results despite the continuing economic uncertainty in a highly competitive retail environment. We continue to exercise a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Over the past 2 years, we've returned more than $58 million of excess cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. Our strong balance sheet provides us with financial flexibility and affords us the opportunity to pursue our strategic growth initiatives. The upcoming launch of our exciting new pontoon brand is an example of why we are confident in our ability to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders. As we move beyond inventory rebalancing, we are determined to leverage our strong and growing portfolio of brands, deliver on our commitments, pursue long-term growth opportunities and generate exceptional shareholder returns. Operator, we may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJoe Altobello: So first question I wanted to ask about the guidance. It implies a sequential decline in sales and EBITDA from Q2 to Q3, which is unusual. Is that all due to heightened promotional activity or are there other dynamics going on in the business?\nTim Oxley: There are other dynamics, Joe. For instance, we were shut down for a full week of production due to snow here in Tennessee, ice storm effective production at Crest as well. The other thing we're doing is making sure we allow our dealers some breathing room to clear the decks for additional inventory in Q4.\nJoe Altobello: Okay. That's helpful, Tim. And maybe in terms of units this year, I think the expectation at least 3 months ago was units would be down over 40%. Is that still the case, and if so, does that get field inventories to where you need them to be by fiscal year-end.\nTim Oxley: That's what we are expecting, Joe.\nJoe Altobello: Okay. And so it sounds like you guys will exit the fiscal year clean, if you will from an inventory perspective.\nTim Oxley: Absolutely. And keep in mind the fourth quarter our retail will determine exactly where we land.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is now open.\nCraig Kennison: I wanted to start with just a question, Fred, on your perspective on the health of your dealer network. We know they're under a lot of strain with skinny margins and excess floor plan costs, but how would you characterize the health of your dealer network?\nFred Brightbill: I would characterize it overall as very good. And that's not to say that there isn't an occasional issue here or there, but it's been very sporadic and isolated, but certainly, as you've indicated, dealers are, in general, heavily inventoried, incurring additional costs and they're selling at very tight margins, which is not a long-term sustainable situation. We don't expect them to be in that situation long term. We expect to get through this and be able to return to more normal conditions.\nTim Oxley: Craig, I would add, we monitor the dealers health. We've been watching it very closely. We have a monthly meeting with the floor plan companies to make sure there are no early warning signs of duress and we'll continue that through the season.\nCraig Kennison: Is there a way to frame the number of units by which you exceed maybe target inventory levels in the channel?\nFred Brightbill: Well, the way we think about it, Craig, is again where we're trying to end up at the end of the year. And this year, we still expect to pull out somewhere between 600 and 800 units.\nTim Oxley: Split fairly between press brands.\nCraig Kennison: That's really helpful. And then I guess 1 more question on the decision to add a Pontoon brand within the Crest facility. Just if you would, talk about any sort of capital requirements that entails? And what's the broader vision for having 2 brands instead of just one.\nFred Brightbill: First of all, minimal capital expense, don't have the same 200 requirements on the pontoon business, as you would in the fiber glass in terms of molds, facility expansion, directly related to that facility expansion was recently completed within the last year that provides the capability, be able to produce this product. So there was some investment made, but it has been made historically. And as we look forward, I don't expect any significant capital allocation to the new brand. With regard to the positioning because of its premium, almost ultra-premium positioning, we felt it was appropriate to have the brand and be able to target it to those consumers specifically. It will touch on the upper end of the offering in terms of price points of the Crest brand. So there's some minor overlap but in general it's going to be positioned differently than the Crest brand.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Wold with B. Riley Securities. Your line is open.\nEric Wold: Two questions. I guess, one, just a follow-up. I can't remember if Frederic, when you talked about the dealers seeing kind of extraordinary low margins right now on boat sales. If you take floor plan costs out of the equation to try to kind of get to an apples-to-apples basis with pre-pandemic levels to take interest rates out, are the margins are seeing lower than pre-pandemic because of higher promotions or the extra pressure purely from the floor plan cost?\nFred Brightbill: And I believe it's in addition to the floor plan costs, Eric. In such a competitive market now, that price competition has driven down their margins in addition to the floor plan costs.\nTim Oxley: And typically, the dealers book the floor plan cost in their G&A, so it doesn't affect their margin, so it's very competitive out there. And their margin on current product is significantly different than the margin on noncurrent. And that's always been the case, but they have more noncurrent than is typical. So typically for dealers, you'll see the noncurrent margins coming down and the current margins remaining pretty steady. And I think that's the case, but there are more noncurrents now than they've had in the past.\nEric Wold: And do you expect the competitive environment to remain in place even after channel inventories get to more healthier levels? Is that kind of a different environment right now or is it really because of the higher inventories out there?\nFred Brightbill: I don't think it will remain at the same level of discounting, but we do expect it to revert to normal aggressive competition. Hopefully, I'm being clear on my answer. I think it's in a peak of competitiveness currently, I don't think it will revert anywhere near COVID situations, but I think it will be much more like a pre-COVID period.\nEric Wold: Got it. And then just final question, if I may. I know it's early and not necessarily looking for fiscal '25 guidance. But I guess there's a hope that interest rates do come down to some degree over the next 12 months or so. I guess what are you hearing from dealers now in terms of any indications in terms of as they look into model '25, what level of inventory they're willing to hold on their floors given interest rates, the competitive environment, macro uncertainty. If you look at that compared to what you may have seen pre-pandemic. I mean how much lower do you think in the willing to hold inventory versus back then?\nFred Brightbill: I think the dealers, the way we work with dealers is to project retail demand and bounce their inventories accordingly. And so it's all going to depend on as we enter the year, what the annual business plan is and what our outlook is. And Eric, as you know, we're right now in a period of limited visibility in terms of what next years are really going to look like. So I can't opine on next year with any degree of certainty other than to say, we will know as we finish May and June, how we're set up for the following year and how we progress through the summer. My personal opinion is if we see interest rate reductions that's going to boost consumer confidence and their level of activity in addition to the other benefits that you described with regard to overall financing costs, et cetera. But will that happen? And to what extent will we see those, will the initial rate reduction be a signal that encourages consumers to be more active or will it take more significant reductions, and then how will those reductions play out in terms of short-term rates versus longer-term rates in retail financing for consumers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nNoah Zatzkin: I guess just first, not to beat inventory to debt. And I know there's obviously a seasonal component to inventory up in the second quarter. But as you're thinking about it today, would you expect to make progress on inventory exiting the third quarter or is that kind of more of a fourth quarter push? And then relatedly, just in terms of the competitive environment, what I guess is anything changing via incentives or promo to help clean inventory looking forward relative to what kind of took place in the second quarter. Thanks.\nFred Brightbill: I think the third quarter, we'll see increased competition, and that's kind of reflected in our outlook for the third quarter in terms of discounting margins, et cetera, competitiveness. With regard to inventory model, it peaks seasonally in the third quarter and then is increasingly worked off. So starts with boat shows and then builds. But as you well know that fourth quarter is 45% to 50% of retail demand, and that's really what you're trying to predict and forecast and be ready for, not underestimate, not overestimate. So you see some movement as sales accelerate in the third quarter, but really it's the fourth quarter when you see the big movement.\nNoah Zatzkin: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the new Pontoon brand. Any additional color on positioning relative to Crest and just maybe some thoughts around kind of why now would be helpful. Thanks.\nFred Brightbill: Think of it as premium, super premium, if you will. Think of it's going to be a very stunning and unique style, and we felt like it deserved a specific attention and positioning given its uniqueness and given its differentiation. So the Crest product line is very broad, as you know, covers a wide range of price points, and they still have luxury models, and those models will continue to be enhanced as we roll forward, but there will be a positioning and a styling differentiation between the two brands that significant.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Swartz with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Swartz: I think when you gave initial guidance for '24 back in, I think it was late August, it was based upon a mid-teens decline in retail demand for the fiscal year. I think since then, the industry has been down something more in the range of low single digits. So maybe just give us an update on what's embedded into your guidance today? And maybe how you're thinking about the year playing out. I know a lot of contingent on interest rates. But just as far as you have visibility today, how do you see the year playing out from a retail standpoint?\nTim Oxley: Mike, it's going to vary certainly by brand segment of the market. But our view is a little more optimistic than it was at the start of the fiscal year. We're just going to really have to work hard and dealers are going to have to work hard for every retail sale.\nMichael Swartz: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on Aviara. We have to discuss that in a little bit, but some change in leadership, it sounds like there. Just maybe give us a little bit of a backdrop on where we are from a profitability standpoint. I think years ago the view was that this brand would be from a profitability standpoint in line with the corporate average. I guess is that still the target today?\nTim Oxley: Our target hasn't changed, and we believe with a new leader down there that we expect this to be an inflection point between a new leader and getting the four models variance of the 28 up to speed, we expect both those things to be positive for things on a go-forward basis. I think that Q2 was kind of a low point, and we're going to climb out of that. But in the long term, we do expect the margin opportunity there to be second only to MasterCraft within our portfolio.\nOperator: I show no further questions, and this will conclude the question-and-answer session. Thank you for participating. And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

There is also a slide deck summarizing our financial results in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the following commentary is made on a continuing operations basis. With that, I will turn the call over to Fred.\nFred Brightbill: Thank you, Bobby and good morning everyone. Our business performed well during the first quarter, as we delivered better-than-expected results, despite continuing macroeconomic and demand uncertainty. With the summer selling season now complete, we're focused on rebalancing dealer inventories with anticipated retail demand to ensure the health of our dealer network. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, as we prioritize balance sheet resilience and the return of cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Macroeconomic factors including interest rates which could remain elevated for some time are adversely impacting the demand for recreational boats and other luxury consumer goods. The potential for a broader economic downturn during fiscal 2024 could worsen this headwind for the industry. In addition, political and geopolitical risks are creating uncertainties that weigh on consumer confidence. Given the dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, which is limiting retail demand visibility, we are prepared to respond to a range of potential retail demand scenarios. Our dealer inventory levels declined modestly during the quarter. Dealers are cautious to add inventory, as they focus on destocking prior year models ahead of the 2024 boat show and summer selling seasons. Because of the uncertainty and the impact of elevated interest rates on consumer demand and floor plan financing costs, this disciplined approach to inventory management will benefit the long-term health of our dealer partners and our business. While dealer inventories are currently higher than we consider optimal, we expect levels to improve by the end of the fiscal year. Moving on to supply chain. We do not expect inventory availability to be a constraint on our fiscal year 2024 production. Our experienced supply chain team worked diligently with supplier partners to alleviate constraints and support production, and are now focused on cost reduction. Given the uncertain environment, our strong balance sheet is a significant advantage which provides us with abundant financial flexibility. Despite the cyclical headwinds facing the industry, we are well positioned to pursue our capital allocation priorities, including investment in long-term growth. We continue to prudently invest in targeted initiatives that will take advantage of the industry's positive underlying secular trends. These investments will support long-term growth and value creation through product line expansion, relentless innovation and an unyielding focus on the consumer. With our financial position secure and our current strategic growth initiatives fully funded, we expect to continue to allocate most of our free cash flow for the year to our EPS accretive share repurchase program. We recently published our second annual sustainability report, which highlighted our progress on promoting social and environmental responsibility. During fiscal 2023, we expanded our waste recycling program by nearly doubling the amount of reported waste recycled or reused. The MasterCraft brand surpassed $4 million without a lost time incident and we implemented employee engagement initiatives to reinforce our commitment to human capital. Our company's success is due to the dedication of our employees and the loyalty of our customers, and we know we must continue to deliver superior value to ensure our long-term success. We look forward to making boating better and maintaining our company's position at the forefront of the marine industry. In addition, we recently partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital on the Surf to Safe Lives campaign. Our goal through this partnership is to make a meaningful difference in the lives of families across the country. We are proud to announce that the campaign was very successful, and in addition to individual employee contributions the company donated $75,000 to St. Jude. We look forward to continuing to support their mission to understand treat and defeat childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Let me now briefly review some of the latest developments across our brands. At our MasterCraft brand net sales were $75.8 million for the quarter down 33% from the record prior year period. The decrease in net sales, was in line with our expectations given the planned production decrease to rebalance dealer inventories to lower retail demand. MasterCraft recently announced, the Icon package an all-new package for our entry-level NXT series. The aggressive features of the Icon package broaden the NXT's consumer base by appealing to those seeking to make a bolder statement. Features include all-black Z6 tower SeaDek flooring along with exclusive underwater impact pit and tower-mounted lighting. The Icon package complements MasterCraft's extensive model year 2024 lineup which includes the most models available from any brand in the ski/wake category. In addition, MasterCraft continues to set the pace by offering the most wave adjustability exceptional handcrafted quality and unmatched comfort. At Crest net sales were $18.5 million for the quarter down 58% from the prior year period as expected. Elevated interest rates have severely impacted the pontoon category in the near term although we remain optimistic about the long-term secular growth trends. Crest will soon be announcing an all-new line of products to expand its addressable market. We look forward to providing more information on this exciting initiative later this year. At Aviara net sales were $9.9 million for the quarter down 23% compared to the prior year period. During the quarter, Aviara was focused on the introduction of the all-new AV28 which has been incredibly well received by our dealer partners. More than just a single model the AV28 platform consists of four distinct model variants an impressive Surf variant a sterndrive a twin outboard and a single outboard. Aviara began shipping this model during the quarter and we expect the AV28 production to continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. Aviara also expanded its distribution network by adding five new domestic and international points of distribution during the quarter. I will now turn the call over to Tim, who'll provide a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Tim?\nTim Oxley: Thanks, Fred. Focusing on the topline net sales for the quarter were $104.2 million a decrease of $65.3 million or 39% from the record prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to lower unit volumes and increased dealer incentives partially offset by increased prices. Dealer incentives include higher or plan financing costs as a result of increased dealer inventories and interest rates and other retail incentives due to the extremely competitive environment. For the quarter, our gross margin was 21% a decrease of 610 basis points when compared to the prior year period. Lower margins were mainly due to deleveraging on lower production volumes increased dealer incentives and higher input costs partially offset by price increases. Operating expenses were $13.3 million for the quarter down, nearly $500000 from the prior year. Turning to the bottom line. Adjusted net income for the year decreased to $8.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share computed using a revised lower estimated annual effective tax rate of 22% due to continuing investments that yield R&D tax credits. This compares to adjusted net income of $25.7 million or $1.43 for the prior year period computed using a tax rate of 23%. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $12.2 million for the quarter compared to $35.9 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.7%, down 950 basis points from 21.2% in the prior year period. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong, as we ended the year with nearly $190 million of total liquidity, including $90 million of cash and short-term investments and $100 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with no net debt as cash and short-term investments exceeded our outstanding debt balance. Our balance sheet positions us exceptionally well and provides us with ample financial flexibility to ensure sound operations through the business cycle and the ability to fund strategic growth initiatives. During the quarter, we spent nearly $6 million to repurchase 241,000 shares of our common stock. Since initiating our share repurchase program in June of 2021, we have spent nearly $54 million to repurchase nearly 2.1 million shares. These cumulative repurchases provided a 12% benefit to our fiscal first quarter adjusted net income per share. We expect to continue to return cash to shareholders, while prioritizing financial flexibility and high return investments in a business that generate growth and long-term shareholder value. Given the continued economic uncertainty, our outlook for full year fiscal 2024 remains unchanged. As a reminder, consolidated net sales is expected to be between $390 million and $420 million with adjusted EBITDA between $42 million and $52 million and adjusted earnings per share between $1.46 per share and $1.88. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $22 million for the full year. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 consolidated net sales is expected to be approximately $96 million with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $7 million and adjusted earnings per share were approximately $0.22. Although our guidance reflects a significant decline in earnings from fiscal 2023, we expect to generate positive free cash flow which is a testament to our flexible highly variable cost structure and proactive cost control efforts. I'll now turn the call back to Fred for his closing remarks.\nFred Brightbill: Thank you, Tim. As we focus on rebalancing dealer inventories, our business performed well during the first quarter by delivering better-than-expected results. A strong balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility and affords us the opportunity to pursue our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to exercise a disciplined capital allocation. Over the past 24 months, we've returned more than $54 million of excess cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. As we move beyond inventory rebalancing, we are confident in our ability to leverage our portfolio of strong brands, deliver on our commitments, pursue long-term growth opportunities and generate exceptional shareholder returns. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJoe Altobello: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess first question on dealer inventories. You mentioned that they're above optimal at this point. If you could quantify that for us where does inventory stand in terms of weeks on hand today versus where you might have been in 2019? And are there any particular brands that are well above your target at this point?\nFred Brightbill: Joe, the inventory is marginally different. And I would say the heaviest inventory is in the pontoon category, which was the most severely impacted from a demand standpoint. But once again given the programs we have in place and our expectation to work that down over the remainder of the year, we feel reasonably comfortable. It's not where we'd like to be ideally. But it's far from a crisis situation. It's just something that we need to manage our way through as we have in previous cycles.\nTim Oxley: Hey, Joe, this is Tim. I'd like to add. We mentioned that we had showed a modest decrease in our dealer inventory coming from the end of the year. And that's a pretty rare occurrence. I look back at the pre-COVID years, it only happened one time in the 12 years that I was looking at. So we're making some progress in correcting our dealer inventory.\nJoe Altobello: And I apologize you mentioned this earlier and I missed it. But in terms of timing, is it your understanding that you expect to undership demand throughout fiscal 2024 or focus into the spring?\nTim Oxley: It may vary by quarter, but certainly I think our easiest comp is for the fourth quarter. So we expect the inventory to be properly balanced by the end of our fiscal year. It may not make progress, I mean what happens in Q2 is so immaterial that we don't even pay that much attention to the percentages in Q2. Really it comes down to as it does in most years to start of the selling season in April through June.\nJoe Altobello: Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is now open.\nBobby Potter: So this is Bobby. Craig if you're talking, we don't hear you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wold from B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.\nEric Wold: Thanks, good morning everyone. A couple of questions, I guess, can you talk about the significantly higher average prices per boat you saw within the MasterCraft segment boat sequentially and year-over-year, I guess? How much of that was the model year price increases for the start of the year versus voluntary upticks and mix or feature set? And how sustainable do you think these prices are in the macro compare environment we're in? And are you seeing any desire to low to moderate?\nTim Oxley: Yeah. This is Tim, Eric. So what we're seeing is a little bit of a shift toward the XT, NX part of our lineup. The interest rate increases are most impactful in our NXTs. So those are voluntary. Our price increase was pretty moderate this year less than 4% for MasterCraft. So we're entering into a period where we have the large price increases of the past are not going to be used going forward.\nEric Wold: Got it. Okay. And then on the Aviara with the launch of the AV28 line and obviously production or shipments year-over-year were down somewhat a result of that. Is the AV28 disrupting or displacing production of other models? Is it more just the focus got disrupted a little bit in the quarter? How long until you think quarterly production shipments return to what we've seen over the past couple of quarters? Or have you actually seen any decline in demand for Aviara either at retail or with your dealer partners?\nFred Brightbill: The transition to ramp up the 28 was definitely disruptive in production. It requires relayout on the plant and a very different focus in terms of the cycle times of those products. So it's a significant impact in this first half of the year as we ramp it up. We really expect to hit our pace in the second half of the year in terms of the 28 production. There's tremendous demand for that. It's been extremely well-received and we're phasing back on the legacy products at this point in time to really get the 28 going. So that's the overall situation that I would expect to see in the near-term and rolling through the year. I couldn't be more optimistic about the demand for the 28 and it's just a matter of us. We're really making sure that we ramp up carefully and do it well.\nEric Wold: And I apologize if I may just a quick follow-up on that. If there is more of a shift towards the 28 versus the legacy product what does that do to average prices going forward?\nFred Brightbill: Yes. Absolutely. It will drive those ASPs down for Aviara. We're talking more in the range of 100 -- I think something on the order of $170,000 to $180,000 ASP for 28.\nTim Oxley: Yes Eric. So for FY 2024 we expect Aviara ASPs to be down mid single – sorry, mid-20% range for the year.\nEric Wold: Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nFred Brightbill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is now open.\nFred Brightbill: Craig, you there?\nOperator: If your line…\nFred Brightbill: Yes, go ahead.\nOperator: Yes. I was just going to say – just as quick reminder if your line is muted, please unmute. But go ahead, Bobby.\nBobby Potter: No I was just going to say if Craig if you're talking we still can't hear you so.\nOperator: Craig, so sorry about that. I know you did rejoin using the call-me feature. Management how would you like me to proceed?\nBobby Potter: Let's queue up the next question if there are others.\nOperator: Okay. Perfect. I am showing no more questions at this time. So if you all are ready I'm ready to conclude today's conference.\nBobby Potter: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Perfect. So thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect."
