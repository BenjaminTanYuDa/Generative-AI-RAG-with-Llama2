A replay of today's call will also be posted on ir.gitlab.com. I will now turn the call over to GitLab's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sid Sijbrandij.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you for joining us today. We had a strong fourth quarter with 33% revenue growth. We now have 96 customers with ARR over $1 million, up from 63 one year ago. And we continue to see that large enterprises, like Barclays and Blue Halo, are standardizing on GitLab. Speed, productivity, and security are critical for our customers. With GitLab, customers see seven times faster cycle times with 80% fewer code defects. Today, I'd like to discuss our progress this quarter in three key areas. First is our security and compliance capabilities. From secure source scope management and security scanning to GitLab Dedicated, our platform helps customers establish more secure and compliant software development practices. Second is our AI offering, GitLab Duo, which integrates AI throughout the software development life cycle. And third is our Enterprise Agile Planning offering, which expands our platform to users outside of software engineering. Let's start with security and compliance. These are at the heart of our platform and set us apart from the competition. This quarter, we released Remote Development Workspaces into general availability. These workspaces are consistent, reproducible environments that help developers get started faster. This also increases security because it limits the need to clone code to end-user devices. Customers come to GitLab to replace security point solutions. With most point solutions, code isn't scanned at the time it's written that causes friction for developers and increases the time required to find and fix vulnerabilities. T-Mobile recently moved 25,000 projects into GitLab over just two months and increased their security scans to hundreds of thousands per month. Now that they are integrated into GitLab, T-Mobile is looking forward to leveraging GitLab Duo to increase engineering efficiency even more. Oxa, a global provider of autonomous vehicle software, upgraded to GitLab Ultimate in the quarter. The company wanted to modernize multiple developer and security tools, including version control, CI/CD and more. With GitLab Ultimate, Oxa is now able to detect potential security issues earlier in the development process, which is a major game for Oxa, which works in a complex and safety-first environment. Another example is CACI International, a national security company and a leader in agile software development. GitLab allows CACI to deliver more efficiently in an agile development environment and makes it easier to comply with emerging federal regulations. GitLab Dedicated is our single-tenant SaaS solution for customers who need to comply with data isolation and residency requirements. I'm excited to see adoption grow since we made it generally available last year. Organizations like Southwest Airlines are choosing GitLab Dedicated to get the best of both worlds. The security of a single-tenant environment plus the benefits of a SaaS offering that's updated and backed up by GitLab. On to AI. Secure AI is a core part of our platform vision. We enable our customers to adopt AI responsibly. AI helps teams write more code faster. But more code isn't better if it's not secure and high quality. That's why GitLab Duo helps teams not only write code but also understand code and fix vulnerabilities more effectively. Having the broadest DevSecOps platform allows us to add more AI features and deliver more value to our customers. In a recent Omdia Market Radar report on AI-assisted software development, GitLab Duo had the most currently available features of any DevOps platform. Organizations like NatWest, Ultragaz and Magic Leap have invested in GitLab Duo to help them drive efficiency while also ensuring robust security and code quality. Another example is a major telecommunications company in Asia that was looking to boost productivity with AI-powered features, not only in coding but across the entire software development life cycle. After testing Code Suggestions for one month and seeing positive results, in Q4, the company invested in thousands of GitLab Duo licenses to improve engineering productivity. After releasing GitLab Duo Code Suggestions into general availability last quarter, we recently released the beta of GitLab Duo Chat. GitLab Duo Pro now also includes organizational controls that help companies adopt AI responsibly, and we are now selling GitLab Duo Pro for $19 per user per month. We recently launched the GitLab AI Transparency Center to enable our customers to confidently harness the potential of AI with GitLab. The AI Transparency Center documents how we built GitLab Duo Pro to accommodate the right model for the right use cases. It also demonstrates our commitment to transparency and protection of customer data and intellectual property. I'd now like to discuss our improvements in Enterprise Agile Planning. We're hearing from more and more customers who want to rethink how they do planning. They want the planning in the same platform where the engineering work to deliver on the planning is happening. Early in Q4, we launched a new Enterprise Agile Planning SKU. Now customers can get even more value out of GitLab by bringing everyone into a single secure platform. For example, a leading 3D modeling software company upgraded to GitLab Ultimate in Q4 and purchased additional Enterprise Agile Planning seats so they can move their sales team out of Jira and on to GitLab. Finally, on the leadership side, we're excited to welcome to Sabrina Farmer as Chief Technology Officer. Sabrina has 25 years of experience and joins us from Google, where she was directly responsible for the reliability and performance of Google's products and infrastructure. I look forward to the impact Sabrina will have across the company. In closing, we're well positioned to win in the estimated $40 billion market opportunity in front of us. I'd like to thank all our customers, partners, team members, community members and investors for their support. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian Robbins, GitLab's Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian Robins: Thank you, Sid, and thank you again for everyone joining us today. I'll start with a brief recap of our full year and quarter results. In FY 2024, total revenue grew 37% to $580 million. Our growth continues to be driven by our land and expand motion. Our dollar based net retention was 130% in Q4. We delivered on breakeven free cash flow a year ahead of our commitment with free cash flow of $33 million in FY'24. In addition, on a standalone basis, excluding the impact of JiHu, our JV and majority-owned subsidiary, we recorded our first year of non-GAAP operating profit. We are thrilled to have achieved these milestones. These are a testament to our philosophy for responsible growth. Our fourth quarter revenue grew 33% year-over-year, and we delivered over 1,900 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. Looking back at the quarter, I want to share some of the areas we've been closely monitoring. These include customer buying behavior, contraction and Ultimate performance. In comparing Q4 with Q3 of FY'24, we've seen improved buying behavior across all customer sizes. In particular, performance with our enterprise customers exceeded expectations. We had a record quarter for $100,000 ARR and $1 million ARR customer net adds. While the spending environment remains cautious, we believe we are starting to see buying behavior normalize with accelerated adoption of our DevSecOps platform. Churn and contraction during Q4 also improved for the fourth consecutive quarter and is even better than levels we saw six quarters ago. And finally, we continue to see strong growth in Ultimate, our top tier. Ultimate represented over 50% of Q4 ARR bookings driven by customer wins for security and compliance use cases. Now turning to the numbers for the quarter. Revenue of $164 million this quarter represents an increase of 33% organically from Q4 of the prior year. We ended Q4 with over 8,600 customers with ARR of at least 5,000 compared to over 8,100 customers in the third quarter of FY'24. This compares to over 7,000 customers in Q4 of the prior year and a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. Currently, customers with over $5,000 in ARR represents approximately 95% of our total ARR. We also measure the performance and growth of our larger customers, who we define as those spending more than $100,000 and $1 million in ARR with us. At the end of the fourth quarter of FY'24, we had 955 customers with ARR of at least $100,000 compared to 874 customers in Q3 of FY'24. This compares to 697 customers in the fourth quarter of FY'23, a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 37%. At the end of FY'24, we had 96 customers with ARR of at least $1 million compared to 63 at the end of the prior year, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 52%. As many of you know, we don't believe calculated billings to be a good indicator of our business given that prior period comparisons can be impacted by a number of factors, most notably our history of large prepaid multiyear deals. This quarter, total RPO grew 55% year-over-year to $674 million. cRPO grew 40% to $430 million for the same time frame. We ended our fourth quarter with a dollar based net retention rate of 130%. As a reminder, this is a trailing 12 month metric that compares the expansion activity of customers over the last 12 months with the same cohort of customers during the prior 12 month period. Non-GAAP gross margins were 92% for the quarter. SaaS represents over 25% of total revenue and grew 52% year-over-year. We have been able to maintain a best-in-class non-GAAP gross margins despite the higher cost of SaaS delivery. This is another example of how we continue to drive efficiencies in the business. We saw improved operating leverage this quarter largely driven by realizing greater efficiencies as we continue to scale the business. Q4 non-GAAP operating profit was $13.2 million or 8% of revenue compared to a loss of $13.8 million or negative 11% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. This includes an operating loss of $2.1 million for JiHu. On a standalone GitLab basis, Q4 non-GAAP operating income was $15.3 million or 9% of revenue. Cash from operating activities was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter of FY'24 compared to a $11.7 million use of cash in operating activities in the same quarter of last year. Free cash flow was $24.5 million in the fourth quarter of FY'24 compared to negative $12.8 million in the same quarter of last year. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less cash used for property and equipment, excluding nonrecurring items. Turning to guidance, I'd like to make a couple of comments. First, we are entering our third year as a public company. As I mentioned, we are seeing normalization buying behavior as a result. I expect our guidance philosophy to be less conservative this year than in the first two years. We want to communicate the right expectations and are sharing guidance accounting for the current environment. Second, as a reminder, every year, we evaluate our standalone selling price or SSP, which determines our upfront revenue recognition rate for license revenue. We have not finished our SSP analysis for the new year so we have not factored any change to SSP in the FY'25 guide. We will share an update at the next earnings call once we have the results of the SSP analysis. With that said, our guidance for first quarter of FY 2025. We expect total revenue of $165 million to $166 million, representing a growth rate of 30% to 31% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $13 million and $12 million. The loss includes an approximately $15 million expense related to our in-person company-wide Summit. As an all-remote company, we're thrilled to bring team members together in the same location for the first time since 2019. And we expect non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.05 to $0.04, assuming 158 million weighted average basic shares outstanding. For the full year FY 2025, we expect total revenue of $725 million to $731 million, representing a growth rate of approximately 26% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating income of $5 million to $10 million, and we expect non-GAAP net income per share of $0.19 to $0.23, assuming 168 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe that our continued focus on responsible growth will yield further improvements in our unit economics. We plan to be free cash flow positive again in FY'25, excluding any nonrecurring cash tax payments related to the bilateral advanced pricing agreement. There are a number of drivers we believe will fuel our business in FY'25, which we have included in our guidance. At our core, we see that continuing to deliver customer value with our DevSecOps platform aligns our success with our customer success. Additionally, in April last year, we raised the price of our Premium tier for the first time in five years. Thus far, customer behavior has been in line with our expectations, and we expect to be $10 million to $20 million of incremental revenue in FY'25. Another driver is GitLab Dedicated. GitLab Dedicated allows us to serve companies in highly regulated industries with complex security and compliance requirements. We continue to sign large enterprises on Dedicated. For example, a leading US airline expanded on Dedicated with a seven-figure deal during Q4. The final driver for FY'25 is the monetization of our AI capabilities. GitLab Duo Pro is now in the market at $19 per user per month. Separately, I'd like to provide an update on JiHu, our China joint venture. Our goal remains to deconsolidate JiHu. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or timing when this may potentially occur. Thus, for modeling purposes for FY'25, we forecast approximately $15 million of expenses related to JiHu compared with $18 million in FY'24. In closing, I'm pleased with our business momentum driven by our market-leading platform approach and commitment to capturing our large market opportunity. We hit major milestones for free cash flow and non-GAAP operating income profit while growing the business. I'm proud of the consistent execution of FY'24. With that, we'll now move to Q&A. To ask a question please use the chat feature and post your question directly to IR Questions. We're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob at Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll ask the kind of the broader economic outlook question right now because, Brian, you did indicate improved buying behavior, record deals above $100,000, above $1 million. And we have seen some unevenness out there. There's still some layoffs happening in high tech. And if I look at your open reqs, it does appear you have somewhat accelerated hiring over the last couple of months. Maybe frame for us, is this your view that things have bottomed in the economy? And maybe provide high-level thoughts around just planning for the upcoming fiscal year relative to sales capacity or other functional areas that you're putting these bodies into. Thanks.\nBrian Robins: Yes. Absolutely, Rob. Thanks for the question. We are seeing customer buying behavior normalize with particular strength in enterprise. This showed up in our numbers this quarter. A couple of examples I'll go through. One is we're seeing strong expansion within the existing customer base. With dollar based net retention, we had an uptick up to 130% from 128% last quarter. Churn and contraction also continues to improve. It's even better than rates that we saw six quarters ago. In terms of investing in the business, as we said, we're long-term focused as a business, and we plan to continue to grow responsibly. The areas that we're adding new head count within the company are sales capacity and key R&D roles.\nRob Owens: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll move on to Koji from Bank of America.\nKoji Ikeda: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on operating margin guidance. You finished the year here in the fourth quarter at 8% operating margin, guiding the full year next year at 1%. And then, Brian, given your comment on maybe a little bit less conservative in the guidance for next year, can you maybe walk us through some of the upcoming levers to drive operating margin expansion from here? Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Yes. Absolutely, Koji. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're having our in-person summit this year. That's in first quarter. The estimated expense for that is $15 million. We haven't had an in-person event at the company since 2019. Being all-remote company, it's really important that we have that. Also in the guidance numbers, we have JiHu, which is roughly $15 million as well. And so for the full year, we guided positive $5 million to $10 million, and that includes the $15 million for JiHu as well as the $15 million for the in-person event.\nOperator: We'll now move to Kash at Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Great finish to the fiscal year sort of reversal from how we started out ending on a very strong note. So nice to see the net expansion rate metric rebound. I think you're one of the very first in software to see the rebound in net expansion rates. cRPO, RPO, all this looks good. Sid, with your -- I shouldn't say new head of sales, but you have a new head of go-to-market. For this full fiscal year, what are the changes we should be expecting as a result of the introduction of new products, quotas, competitive win rates, new product contribution, pricing? There's so many things that are happening at GitLab that are all quite positive, right? How should we rank order the impact of those things in your growth algorithm for this year? Thank you so much.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. Thanks, Kash. We're super excited that Chris is doing so well. Him joining is evolution, not revolution. So he is continuing the line. We continue to focus on the customers where we can have the most impact, which are typically the largest customers in regulated industries. And we're super excited about the things you mentioned, all the extra things that we now have that we can start selling. Duo Pro, we introduced but also the planning features that allow customers to put their planning in the platform as well the Enterprise Agile Planning SKU and GitLab Dedicated. I think all these extra offerings we can have are a great addition on top of Ultimate, which is more and more important to us and which resonates more and more in the markets.\nKash Rangan: So Brian, one for you and I'll finish up. With all these levers that Sid is talking about, why is the guidance seemingly conservative? Or is it just that discounting these -- the effects of these new features and products because we just don't have enough data, are you waiting for it to play out? How should we characterize the guidance? Thank you so much.\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks, Kash. Yes, we do have a number of growth drivers for FY'25 and beyond. I think you've named a number of them. It takes a while to build pipeline and close deals on new products. And so the total number of revenue that we have for next year for it to make a meaningful impact in a ratable business model is going to take a little while for that to come to fruition. And so we've put all the new products into the guidance. They're relatively new. And so didn't want to put a lot in right now. With the Premium price increase, we're still saying it's roughly $10 million to $20 million of incremental revenue in FY 2025. And then we have Dedicated, Enterprise Agile Planning and Duo Pro as well. So lots of new growth vectors for next year. It will just take a little while for them to impact the top line.\nOperator: We'll now move to Ryan at Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for taking the question. One for Sid and one for Brian. Sid and guys, thanks for the continued partnership with Barclays. Look, just on the early indications of Duo Pro, we'd love to hear how demand has trended there. And then how do you think about monetizing AI outside of Duo Pro? Like are you seeing customers who are interested in AI, also more interested in your security features or up-tiering to Ultimate? And then for Brian, just really quick, love to hear what the incremental price increase contribution was for the fourth quarter. Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. Thanks for that, Ryan. So Duo is resonating in the market and we were really pleased with the Omdia report that we had more AI features than any other platform. We could add value in more cases. And you talk about security and Ultimate, we have the most comprehensive security offering of any DevOps platform that allows us to also release more AI features. And some of these features are not in Duo Pro, but they're part of Ultimate. So Ultimate now has more and more AI features. So AI is helping to drive Ultimate as well because Ultimate, the number one reason why people by that is because it helps them get more secure and every feature that is in Ultimate and that is now getting enhanced with AI that AI we give to the customers of Ultimate by default.\nRyan MacWilliams: Then Brian, just real quick, if you could have the incremental price increase contribution to the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nBrian Robins: We haven't broken out towards the fourth quarter. We just said for next year, it will be roughly $10 million to $20 million in incremental revenue is what we included in our guidance.\nRyan MacWilliams: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nBrian Robins: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Next, we have Joel at Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the great execution. Sid, just one for you on -- are you seeing any increased conversions around agile planning with the Atlassian server end-of-life approaching?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. For us, it's a new market. And Brian just talked about new markets. They start slowly and then they accelerate in the outer years. But we talked about a customer switching from Jira to GitLab again in the last quarter. So that's really exciting that we get to talk about that. And we see an increasing pipeline. If customers are able to bring planning to the same platform, they don't have to create all these different connections between their planning tooling and their software creation tooling. With GitLab, it works by default. It's a better experience. There's less ceremony that they need to do. It is one interface, one data source, and that's appealing to customers. We're very excited about our Enterprise Agile Planning SKU that we can sell along with the rest of GitLab.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Pinjalim at JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Two-part question for Brian. How much of the RPO growth of 55% is driven by price versus any elongation in contract length? Any way to kind of understand the components of that. And then on pricing, I know you're not giving up the Q4 number. But for the -- you have closed out FY'24 now. Is it possible to understand again the pricing benefit for the full year in dollar terms? Is it 1%, 2% of growth? Any help you can provide us at all?\nBrian Robins: Yes. On the -- let me start first with the RPO growth of 55%. cRPO growth was 40%. And so overall, we had a really strong quarter and happy with the performance in the quarter from a bookings perspective. As we previously stated, billings and RPO within a quarter are not good indicators of our core business momentum, that they can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoices and the duration of the customer contracts. We did have a number of multiyear deals this quarter, which contributed to the RPO growth. On the pricing benefit, I said $10 million to $20 million for next year. We haven't broken out what it is by quarter and don't plan to do that going forward.\nPinjalim Bora: Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: We now have Nick at Scotiabank.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys. So you guys talked about how buyer behavior is normalizing, contractions improving. But kind of going off Pinjalim's question around the Premium price increase in that, the impacts that's kind of had in the model. If you look at NRR and you sort of backed out the price increase, would that still sort of be up on a sequential basis? Or is that kind of down excluding the price increases?\nBrian Robins: Yes. I can -- happy to go through what is the buildup in the dollar based net retention rate. And so super happy that the dollar based net retention rate went up this quarter to 130%. We break down between seats, price and tier. So 40% of that was related to seats, 40% was related to price and 20% was related to tier, not too dissimilar from last quarter. It's just a little bit different last quarter. Churn and contraction also continues to improve. As I stated earlier, it's even better than rates that we saw six quarters ago.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nBrian Robins: Appreciate it.\nOperator: We now have Gregg at Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. So obviously, it's incredibly early in your AI journey, and this isn't very applicable to the Q4. But can you tell us how the uptake for GitLab Duo has been so far both in terms of the introductory price for the first couple of weeks and for the regular price that kicked in on Feb 1? Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. Thanks. I think customers have been responding well to Duo. So they're mostly excited about the breadth of our GenAI capabilities, including things like vulnerability summary, vulnerability resolution, root cause analysis. An example is a major telco in Asia. They wanted to boost their AI workflow across their entire development life cycle. And they saw positive results after testing Code Suggestions. And in Q4, they committed thousands to thousands of GitLab Duo licenses to improve engineering productivity all the way through the process.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Now we'll move to Shebly at FBN.\nShebly Seyrafi: Thank you very much. So I think in prior quarters, you noted that sales cycles for the SMB mid-market had been elongated. And this quarter, you said enterprise is better than expected. So did SMB continue to be more challenged? Did the sales cycles improve? Just elaborate on what you're seeing in the SMB mid-market segment.\nBrian Robins: Thanks for that, Shebly. We're seeing customer buying behavior normalizing across the board. We didn't break out the sales cycles for SMB and mid-market in particular. But as I said the churn and contraction, it's best that we see in six quarters. And sales cycles have normalized across the board.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl at UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe for Brian, to your comment that you're electing to take a less conservative posture on the guidance, maybe a two-parter. Why -- what's the logic there? Is it just that GitLab is now a big organization and across a bigger scale and customer base? You've just got a little more precise visibility. Is that it? Or is it in reaction to the environment? And then I've got a quick follow-up on the same subject.\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks for that, Karl. Going into our third year as a public company and also seeing the normalization of buying behavior, we'll just be less conservative in the guidance that we're giving out.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. And then I guess the follow-up would be, did you make that change for the fourth quarter such that the beat you just put up in the January quarter might -- we can look as kind of a start of this more conservative guidance posture? Or is it more going forward?\nBrian Robins: No, it's more going forward. Very happy with the bookings this quarter. We had the largest bookings quarter in company history. There is many first within the quarter. Largest hyperscaler contribution, largest first order, largest Ultimate, and we had a greater number of $1 million-plus deals. There was some linearity in the quarter. Things came more back in, in the quarter than expected.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Now move to Matt at RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results. You mentioned a number of the drivers in the prepared remarks. One that I don't think you talked about was free-to-pay, and I know there's been an increased focus on that. Any update on that sort of focus? Because it really does feel like that's a real long-tail opportunity, but curious if there's anything to mention there.\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks, Matt. We are getting a lot of free-to-pay conversion. However, the numbers are relatively low so they don't come into the base customer count. And if you look at the overall sort of ARR that they're contributing, it's relatively small at this point.\nOperator: We'll now move to Peter at Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you and congratulations on another great quarter. Really looking forward to the momentum you're seeing. Maybe I build on an earlier question around Duo. Can you help us kind of understand how the attach rate initially is working? And if you look at customers and their use of the product, are you seeing that type of thing where it's getting into people's workflows and kind of the accelerating usage? Or is it still more kind of in experimental stages with customers? And then I guess maybe the adjunct to this is if you look further forward, what do you think makes it sticky? In other words, like once people really get into there, is it going to be easy to switch away eventually? Or is there some reason why this thing like just really becomes like a tick in the system?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. To answer your -- the last part of your question first, we're excited about the amount of AI features we can add to GitLab because we have the broadest platform. We can address the most use cases. And us, according to the Omdia report, kind of addressing more use cases than any other DevOps platform, that's why I think it's going to be more sticky rather than less sticky. The feedback so far has been positive. Customers like NatWest have invested in GitLab to help drive efficiency and at the same time, ensuring robust security and code quality. Our customers have reported efficiency improvements upwards of 50%. Still early in the AI journey, and we expect further durations as we expand Duo across the life cycle.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Gil at D.A. Davidson.\nGil Luria: Thank you. So stepping back a little bit in terms of margins, you're going to do more than 700 million of revenue this year and you have 90% gross margins. At your scale, isn't there more margin upside at this scale? I think you may have gotten a little bit of a pass when you were growing more than 30%. But if we're guiding to closer to 25%, 26% revenue growth, you gave a lot of margin expansion last year, shouldn't there be more margin expansion this year?\nBrian Robins: Yes. Gil, thanks for the question. Super happy with the operating leverage that we've been able to get in the model. This is our second quarter of non-GAAP operating income positive. If you look for the full year FY'24, we generated roughly about $33 million of cash. And even with JiHu, for the full year, we're almost non-GAAP operating income breakeven. And so there's two things I talked about in the prepared remarks that go into the guidance number that we gave for F 2025. The first thing is our in-person summit, which will be a $15 million expense in the first quarter that we didn't have last year. And then the second thing is we have JiHu that's still in our numbers, which is a noncash expense, which is roughly $15 million as well. And for the full year, $5 million to $10 million is the guidance. And there's $30 million sort of in those numbers, one is noncash JiHu and the other is the in-person summit that will happen in first quarter.\nGil Luria: Got it. Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Derrick at Cowen.\nDerrick Wood: Great, thanks. Hey, Brian, this is for you. I guess, just looking at these numbers, really impressive, 40% cRPO growth. That was an acceleration from 34%. Last quarter, you had a two-point uptick in net revenue retention rate at 1.30. I guess in the context of this, it looks like your guidance of 25% to 26% revenue growth for fiscal '25 would be conservative. So just two questions. Are there any drags in the model we should be aware of that may not be reflected in the backlog or the trailing 12 month NRR numbers? And then is it fair to say you think that growth tailwinds from pricing and from AI will be higher in fiscal '26 versus fiscal '25?\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks for that, Derrick. As we stated earlier, billings and RPO is not a great indicator. They're directionally correct. Super happy with the quarter overall. The points that you made, obviously, are all true and valid. The revenue growth of 33% are guided 26% next year. That factors in the buying behavior and the normalization that we've seen in the market. We do have a ratable model. And then being a -- entering our third year as a public company, that's when we -- we said our guidance was to be less conservative than the prior two years. And so I think the setup with the new products and the normalization of buying behavior as well as the metrics that we put up this quarter is a good setup for next year.\nDerrick Wood: And just on the follow-on with price tailwinds, would you comment on whether they would be bigger in fiscal '26 versus fiscal '25?\nBrian Robins: By the nature of the ratable model and then the step-up that you get, I would anticipate '26 to be bigger than '25.\nDerrick Wood: Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, thanks, Derrick.\nOperator: We'll now move to Allan at Wolfe Research.\nAllan Verkhovski: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question here. I want to follow up on the comments provided around normalizing trends. Looks like customers with over 5,000 ARR accelerated more than 23%. And while you pointed out strength in enterprise, can you just kind of give us the story in the quarter with respect to enterprise versus last Q4? Was there a higher volume of smaller deals or more big deals? And can you help us think about what a good year would be with respect to net customer add?\nBrian Robins: Yes. A couple of different points there that I'll talk about. One is the 427 that we add in base customers is pretty much been our run rate. As we indicated in the past, we try to make the selling as well as the buying as friction-free as we can. And so we don't set a quota for Ultimate versus Premium nor do we say you have to sell gitlab.com versus self-managed. And so the amount of customers that come out within a given quarter is just sort of an output of how the quarter gets put together. I did mention very happy with the bookings this quarter. We had a number of first in first order expansion, Ultimate hyperscaler contribution and really happy with the 100,000 customer adds as well as a greater than 1 million customer adds, which was up 52% year-over-year.\nAllan Verkhovski: Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Gray at BTIG.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So a follow-up question on the price increases that we've been talking about. You're implementing the price increases on GitLab Premium in two phases. The next one kicks in April. So just how should we think about the net benefit of this second phase versus the first phase. And specifically, is it safe to assume that the second phase has less churn, and therefore, a greater net benefit relative to what we've seen so far?\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks for your question, Gray. Overall, we're pleased with the results of the price increase. The impact of the Premium price increase exceeded our internal expectations. We went through and modeled that prior to doing the price increase. And for FY 2024, it came in above what we modeled internally. And so what we told you for FY 2025 was $10 million to $20 million of incremental contribution in revenue over FY 2024. And we've built in the benefit that you've alluded to on the churn and sort of the second tier and so forth of what the assumptions are for that.\nGray Powell: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Mike at Needham.\nMike Cikos: Hey, thanks for getting me on here, guys. Brian, I think first question for you. Just with the guidance, a bit of a two-parter here, but I know you're talking about how there's less conservatism in the guide now. And I just want to make sure I'm clear. Is that -- the first part, is that for both revenue and OpEx as far as the implied cost structure there? Or is it more just for the revenue? And then I guess the follow-on to that, I know the company has like really beat the drum as far as profitable scale. And so even if I X out the $15 million of summit, and I'm not going to back out JiHu just because it seems like a recurring cost until you I guess, take it out as a consolidated statement. But there's still a massive uptick in the implied OpEx when I think about your guidance. And that's really what I'm trying to square on my side.\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks. You're correct. We have been very consistent since the IPO road show is our number one objective is to grow, but we'll do that responsibly. The less conservative, we've if you beat the profitability pretty handedly every quarter. And so it's more directed at the top line than the bottom line. But we still want -- the number one thing at the company is still to grow, and we'll do that responsibly. And so you can expect that from us.\nMike Cikos: Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up too. I know in the Q&A, I think you had called out from a linearity perspective, the quarter seemed to be a little bit more back half weighted. And so just curious, again, we're trying to get our arms around this guidance here. Was there any change in customer behavior or purchasing patterns as we moved into -- we now have, call it, a month or two under our belt for the current quarter? Or were things relatively unchanged as far as the spending patterns you're seeing?\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks for that. We typically haven't commented sort of up into earnings. We comment sort of up until the quarter close. And we did see normalization across the entire -- across enterprise, mid-market and SMB. And I've also mentioned that we saw churn and contraction back to what we've seen six quarters ago. And so that obviously gave us some confidence to give the guidance that we gave.\nMike Cikos: Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Jason at William Blair.\nJason Ader: Thank you. Hey, guys. Nice to see you both. Brian, just trying to square, I guess, with everybody else the guidance with the less conservative posture comment. In particular, if NRR is trending up and is around 130%, doesn't this imply that NRR would have to decline from here for revenue growth to be in the mid-20s?\nBrian Robins: There's a number of factors that go into our guidance. We build it from a bottoms-up perspective. And I would just say that what we reported was actuals and what we're guiding to is guidance, right? So it's not comparing apples-to-apples.\nJason Ader: Okay. Then I want to squeeze one in for Sid. Because Sid, you're just sitting there. Nobody's asking you any questions. It's not right. But really I wanted to -- I know you've covered this, but can you just refresh us quickly on GitLab's key differentiators versus GitHub? I know there's a lot of questions always on GitLab versus GitHub, but just talk about where you are today on differentiation and where you expect to be going forward.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. Thanks for that opportunity. So we're winning deals against GitHub because we have the most comprehensive platform. In security and compliance, only we have DAST the dynamic scanning, the container scanning, the API security and the compliance management, the ability to prove that you've done all of that. For example, T-Mobile moved 25,000 software projects to GitLab in two months, and then they were able to start hundreds of thousands of security scans. In planning and management, only we have Enterprise Agile Planning, value stream management, DORA metrics. And because we are better able to address those use cases, we're also able to build AI features that build on that. For example, the ability to explain vulnerabilities and to have the AI suggest a fix. So we're really bullish in competing because we have the broadest platform and because that enables us to do more with AI.\nJason Ader: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Kingsley at Canaccord Genuity.\nKingsley Crane: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When we speak with customers, we hear that consumption associated with compute minutes has the potential to be a really meaningful part of the customer's total spend once they start adopting products like CI/CD. How often are compute and storage considerations factoring into their customer upselling into Premium and Ultimate? And how do you expect newer products like GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise Agile Planning to affect these needs?\nSid Sijbrandij: So GitLab does have consumption pricing for that. For us, it's not a material part of our revenue yet. We do allow people to bring their own runners, so to bring their own compute to bear for CI and CD. We expect a lot out of our new SKUs, but the impact is going to be seen over time. So for Duo, the AI features for planning. For Dedicated, the biggest impact is not going to be in the coming fiscal years but in the outer years.\nKingsley Crane: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Yi Fu at Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYi Fu Lee: Thank for taking my question and congrats on a very strong finish. Questions for either Sid or Brian. There's more of a back-to-basic question. I know Sid mentioned at the beginning of the call that consolidation is very healthy, right? At GitLab, I was wondering, like can you discuss what are the legacy solutions you're consolidating? And what inning are we in now? And how much is left in the tank? And I have a quick follow-up for Brian as well.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. If you're looking, for example, at Enterprise Agile Planning, by far, the most popular incumbent is Jira from Atlassian. And we're in the very early innings. We've only just started offering this. And we're very encouraged by the progress. A leading 3D modeling company upgraded to GitLab Ultimate in Q4, and they purchased additional Enterprise Agile Planning seats, so they could move their sales teams out of Jira and into GitLab. But it's early innings. Our market share there is just starting to ramp up, and it will take some time. Thanks for the question.\nYi Fu Lee: And then, Brian, a quick follow-up is other cloud-native software companies, they guide based upon like what they see the last couple of quarters. Was wondering when you built your fiscal '25 guidance, how did you do so? Did you look at your trends, how it was like last year, the last couple of quarters? Wanted to get your thoughts on that, and that's it from me.\nBrian Robins: Yes. No, absolutely. Fourth quarter of last year, there was a change in the quarter or two prior to that. And so we actually looked just relatively short-term opposed to over four quarters. Since the buying behavior has more normalized and churn and contraction has been back to where it was six quarters ago, we looked over the entire year to develop our FY 2025 plan.\nYi Fu Lee: Okay. Thank you for that, Brian. Thank you, Sid.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Adam at Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Save the best for last. Good. I wanted to talk about the growth drivers, monetizing AI and GitLab regulated were two things that were brought up on the call. I think we tackled profitability with Brian to [indiscernible] here, so let's do growth. When you think about the AI piece, you've said in the past, 25% is spent on coding and 75% is spent on other tasks. I think a lot of attention gets paid to coding with AI. So I'm just curious your observations and feedback, especially on the other task piece and how you built that or continue to build that into the product. And then on GitLab regulated, if you could just remind us of how to potentially size that and the timing for the impact of that? Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks. Yes. So you're exactly right. Developers spend 25% of their time coding, and we're helping them with Code Suggestions, but there's also all these other tasks we can help them with. 75% of their time is spent elsewhere. And for example, GitLab helps you to review an issue. So if there's an issue like this is where you got to work on, GitLab will help you to summarize that issue. There might sometimes be hundreds of comments from stakeholders, and we'll help you kind of digest all of that. And for every developer, there's a security or operations person that we can make more effective as well. For example, GitLab allows you to not only kind of see what vulnerabilities you have, but the AI will help you explain what the impact is and how you could potentially remediate it. We're super excited that the Omdia market radar report shows that we have 38 out of the 43 areas where you could have AI features in the DevOps platform. We have them covered already. That's the best coverage of any vendor. And that's possible because we have the broadest platform to build that on.\nAdam Tindle: And then GitLab regulated was the other one, just sizing and timing.\nSid Sijbrandij: Brian, do you want to take that?\nBrian Robins: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?\nAdam Tindle: GitLab regulated as another key growth driver that you spoke about here on the call. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about the sizing of that and the timing for that growth driver into the model.\nBrian Robins: Yes. No, absolutely. We talked about a number of growth drivers for this year and new products that were launched. We didn't break out the contribution by driver. And we also noted that with the ratable revenue model and how much we guided to in annual revenue for the year that it would take time for these to make a contribution to the top line.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes our Q4 FY'24 earnings presentation. Thanks, again, for joining us and have a great day."

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release which, along with these reconciliations and additional supplemental information, are available at ir.gitlab.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on ir.gitlab.com. I will now turn the call over to GitLab’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sid Sijbrandij.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong quarter. Revenue grew 32% year-over-year, driven by the continued adoption of our DevSecOps Platform. GitLab is the only DevSecOps platform that brings together security, compliance & governance, AI, and enterprise agile planning. Enterprises face complexity from all directions in the form of rapidly increasing user expectations, more advanced cyber attacks, and more strict industry regulations. We believe they need GitLab to help them navigate this complexity and realize business value. Our platform improves engineering productivity, reduces software spend. That’s why our customers report seeing 7x faster cycle times with GitLab. Today, I’ll discuss how we are driving results in three key areas. First, we’re adding new security & governance capabilities in our platform. Second, we integrated AI throughout the software development lifecycle. And third, we added an Enterprise Agile Planning offering to make our platform available to non-technical users. Let’s start with our security & governance functionality. These are at the heart of our platform and set us apart from the competition. Organizations like CARFAX and Lockheed Martin trust GitLab to help them build security & compliance into their workflows. With GitLab, organizations and their engineering teams report that they catch vulnerabilities earlier in the development process. And compliance leaders can set the right controls and governance frameworks. In contrast, security point solutions can cause friction for developers. With point solutions, developers either have to wait on security teams to identify vulnerabilities. Or, if they have access to a security scanner to assess their code, they need to manually copy and paste the scanner results back into their development tool. The result is, code that isn’t scanned at the time it’s written. This increases the time required to detect and resolve vulnerabilities. Our platform enables organizations to integrate security directly into the developer workflow. A recent product innovation our customers are excited about is our new security findings workflow extension. This extension enables developers to see and address their security findings directly in their IDE while they work, without breaking their flow. Our customers see the value of bringing security and compliance into the same platform where developers work. An example is DoubleVerify, a leading software platform for digital media measurement, data, and analytics. DoubleVerify was previously using GitLab Premium alongside several point solutions for their application security needs. They recently upgraded to GitLab Ultimate to bring security findings closer to their developers. Now, their developers can identify, learn about, and fix vulnerabilities in the same place where they work, without switching applications. Another key differentiator for us in the security & compliance space is GitLab Dedicated, our single-tenant SaaS solution that provides customers with data isolation and residency. With GitLab Dedicated, customers in highly regulated industries get the benefit of a comprehensive DevSecOps platform while meeting complex and stringent compliance and regulatory requirements. A large telecommunications company in Asia-Pacific recently upgraded to GitLab Dedicated to enhance their privacy and compliance capabilities across their software development lifecycle. In Q3 we also launched a new self-serve portal where customers can configure and maintain their GitLab Dedicated instances. This product innovation will create a more effective onboarding experience for new customers. Now, I’d like to discuss our second topic, which is our unique approach to AI. We already have 14 AI features available to our customers. That’s more than any other DevSecOps platform. We continue to innovate. GitLab Duo is our suite of AI-powered DevSecOps workflows that enable customers to boost speed and efficiency without sacrificing privacy, security, and compliance. We have three principles in our AI strategy. First, we are the only platform that integrates AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. As developers become more effective, we enable security and operations team members to keep pace. Also, developers only spend 25% of their time writing code. AI within DevSecOps should focus on more than just code creation. Second, we are privacy and transparency first in our approach to AI. Our customers are eager to use AI, but they want to do so responsibly. To support them with this, we do not use their code to train the AI models used by other customers. Our privacy first approach is why more than 50% of the Fortune 100 trust GitLab to secure their intellectual property. Third, our AI is powered by a diverse set of models from technology partners as well as our own AI models. This allows us to select the best AI model for each use case. In Q3, we released the beta of GitLab Duo Vulnerability Summary. This is a cool feature that provides AI-generated explanations of security vulnerabilities and suggestions for how to fix them. Another example of our progress is GitLab Duo Code Suggestions, our AI-powered code creation feature. It will be generally available in our December product release. We have been hearing from our customers that they are seeing efficiency improvements upwards of 50% with Code Suggestions. And finally, we recently announced the beta release of GitLab Duo Chat. With GitLab Duo Chat, users can quickly understand project status, get help with planning and configuration, receive explanations of suggested code, and generate tests, all without context switching. To start, GitLab Chat is available within the GitLab UI, Web IDE, and VS Code. We plan to add support for more editors in the future. Our approach to AI is resonating with our customers. For example, Amado Gramajo, Vice President of Infrastructure & DevOps at Nasdaq, recently shared his excitement about how GitLab Duo will help Nasdaq protect their intellectual property and stay in line with regulatory mandates. And, presenting at this year’s Gartner Application Innovation Summit, Bal Kang at NatWest said, GitLab Duo enables our developers to be more productive, efficient, and successful in creating secure code. We’re excited to see the benefits of GitLab’s AI features across the entire value chain and even our most seasoned engineers are seeing value. Our next focus area is Enterprise Agile Planning. Our Enterprise Agile Planning offering brings portfolio and project management capabilities into the same platform where engineers work. Organizations already see our Enterprise Agile Planning capabilities as a strong alternative to established tools on the market, like Jira. For example, Iron Mountain, a global information management service provider, was struggling to manage the plugins required to integrate Jira with the rest of their development process. By moving from Jira to GitLab Ultimate, Iron Mountain was able to scale their Agile framework to drive more effective collaboration between Enterprise IT teams and key stakeholders. Atlassian’s decision to stop support for its server offering is making customers reconsider what product they use for Enterprise Agile Planning. We are focused on making it easier for these customers to move to GitLab SaaS and self-managed. We recently launched a new Enterprise Agile Planning SKU. Now, GitLab Ultimate customers can easily bring non-technical users into the platform. Security & compliance, AI, and Enterprise Agile Planning strengthen our position as the leader in the DevSecOps platform category. The breadth and depth of our platform across the entire software development lifecycle differentiate us from point solutions and our main competitor, GitHub. Let me give a few examples of why enterprises choose GitLab. First is a leading global financial platform that tried to integrate GitHub with several other DevOps tools. This created complex workflows that required time-consuming maintenance. Now the customer is moving their code repository and CI from GitHub to GitLab. And GitLab was able to replace other point solutions for automation, continuous delivery, and package management as well. With GitLab, the customer is able to reduce costs and centralize their work on a single platform, with eight times faster deployments and four times faster feature delivery. Another example is a business networking organization that initially built its software development workflows around GitHub. They began hitting usage limits when running builds, and quickly realized that GitHub was not efficient enough to support their growth. They switched to GitLab Premium and saw a 7x increase in the number of pipelines run. They also needed a comprehensive security & compliance solution that GitHub was unable to provide. As a result, the company upgraded to GitLab Ultimate this year to help them build a major new product to serve their rapidly growing customer base. We believe that enterprises need more than a developer platform. They need a full DevSecOps platform that scales and streamlines software development workflows while ensuring robust security and compliance. This was on full display at our DevSecOps World Tour. We recently rounded out this year’s 11-stop World Tour with a final event in Washington, DC. Each event included a fireside chat where customers like Carrefour, Deutsche Telekom, Southwest Airlines, and Splunk shared how they rely on GitLab to improve security, drive efficiency, and accelerate time to market. We created the DevOps Platform category, and we continue to set the standard. We remain focused on helping enterprises build fast and stay secure with tools that teams love to use. We are well-positioned to win in the estimated $40 billion market opportunity in front of us. I’d like to thank all our customers, as well as our partners, team members, community members, and investors, for their continued support. I will now turn it over to Brian Robins, GitLab’s Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian Robins: Thank you Sid, and thank you again for everyone joining us today. Overall we saw strong performance in the third quarter. Our revenue grew 32% year-over-year and we delivered over 2,200 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. I am pleased to share our first quarter of non-GAAP operating profit. This is a major milestone for us in efficiently scaling the business to address our large market opportunity. At the same time, we continue to make targeted investments in key product areas. These include security & governance, AI, and enterprise agile planning. Looking back at the quarter, I want to share some of the areas we have been closely monitoring. These include sales cycles, win rates, contraction, and Ultimate. In comparing Q3 with Q2 of FY ‘24, we have seen overall sales cycles lengthen. During Q3 buying behavior in our enterprise segment stabilized. However in the mid-market and SMB, we see customers continue to be cautious in the uncertain macro environment. We have adapted our go-to-market approach in this environment to deliver predictable and strong results. In Q3, our win rates have improved, signaling that the value proposition of our DevSecOps platform is resonating in the market. Contraction during Q3 also improved for the third consecutive quarter and is in-line with levels from Q3 last year. And finally, we continued to see strong adoption of Ultimate, our top tier. Ultimate represented over 50% of Q3 ARR bookings, driven by customer wins for security & compliance use cases. Now, turning to the numbers. Revenue of $149.7 million this quarter represents an increase of 32% organically from Q3 of the prior year. We ended Q3 with over 8,100 customers with ARR of at least 5,000, compared to over 7,800 customers in the second quarter of FY ‘24. This compares to over 6,400 customers in Q3 of the prior year. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 26%. Currently, customers with greater than 5,000 in ARR represent approximately 95% of our total ARR. We also measure the performance and growth of our larger customers, who we define as those spending more than $100,000 in ARR with us. At the end of the third quarter of FY ‘24, we had 874 customers with ARR of at least $100,000, compared to 810 customers in Q2 of FY ‘24. This compares to 638 customers in the third quarter of FY ‘23. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 37%. As many of you know, we do not believe calculated billings to be a good indicator of our business, given that prior period comparisons can be impacted by a number of factors, most notably our history of large prepaid multi-year deals. This quarter total RPO grew 40% year-over-year to $548.1 million. cRPO grew 34% to $371.8 million for the same time frame. We ended our third quarter with a dollar-based net retention rate of 128%. As a reminder, this is a trailing 12 month metric that compares the expansion activity of customers over the last 12 months, with that same cohort of customers during the prior 12 month period. This quarter we have updated our dollar-based net retention rate calculation methodology to reflect operational changes to our customer account hierarchies. The trend of declining but stabilizing rate has been consistent based on both the previous and the new dollar-based net retention rate calculations. Non-GAAP gross margins were 91% for the quarter, which is consistent with the preceding quarter. This is slightly improved from the third quarter of FY ‘23. SaaS represents over 25% of total revenue and grew 53% year-over-year. We have been able to maintain best-in-class non-GAAP gross margins despite the higher cost of SaaS delivery. This is another example of how we continue to drive efficiencies in the business. We saw improved operating leverage this quarter, largely driven by realizing greater efficiencies as we continue to scale the business. Q3 non-GAAP operating profit was $4.7 million, or 3% of revenue, compared to a loss of $21.6 million, or negative 19% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. This includes an operating loss of $2.6 million for JiHu, our JV and majority owned subsidiary. On a standalone GitLab basis, Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $7.3 million, or 5% of revenue. Operating cash use was $6.0 million in the third quarter of FY ‘24, compared to a $1.2 million use of cash in operating activities in the same quarter of last year. Since FY ’23, we have been proactively negotiating a bilateral advance pricing agreement, or APA, relating to our transfer pricing arrangements between the Netherlands and the US tax authorities. The proposed agreements between the company, the IRS and the Dutch Tax Authority are not yet final. However, given the stage of discussions during the third quarter, we recorded an estimate of $254 million non-recurring income tax adjustment. This adjustment does not impact our non-GAAP earnings per share. I believe this change positions GitLab for the future by optimizing our long-term tax position. The APA will result in an exit cash tax payment to the Dutch Tax Authority in the future. The timing is dependent on ongoing work with both parties and we will keep you updated on future earnings calls. Our modeling shows the exit payment should be recouped as tax savings over future periods. Now let’s turn to guidance. We are assuming that the trends in the business we have seen over the last few quarters continue. For fourth quarter of FY ’24, we expect total revenue of $157 million to $158 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 29% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating income of $5 million to $6 million. And, we expect a non-GAAP net income per share of $0.08 to $0.09, assuming 164 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year FY24, we now expect total revenue of $573 million to $574 million, representing a growth rate of approximately 35% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $10 million to $9 million. And, we expect non-GAAP net income per share of $0.12 to $0.13 assuming 162 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. On a percentage basis, our new annual FY ‘24 guidance implies non-GAAP operating improvement of approximately 1,900 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint of our guidance. We believe that our continued focus on responsible growth will yield further improvements in our unit economics. I’m pleased to guide to a profitable non-GAAP operating income in 4Q. We remain on track to achieve free cash flow breakeven for FY25 excluding any non-recurring cash tax payments related to the APA result I discussed earlier. There are a number of drivers we believe will fuel our business in FY ‘25 and beyond. At our core, continuing to deliver customer value with our DevSecOps platform aligns our success with our customers’ success. Additionally in April of this year, we raised the price of our Premium tier for the first time in five years. Thus far, customer behavior has been in-line with our expectations, although as a reminder we anticipate the real financial impact from this change through FY ‘26. Another driver is the launch of Dedicated. GitLab Dedicated allows us to serve companies in highly regulated industries with complex security & compliance requirements. The largest deal we signed in Q3 was an eight-figure TCV expansion with an auto company on Dedicated. The final driver for FY ‘25 and beyond is the monetization of our AI capabilities. Last month we announced the general availability of GitLab Duo Code Suggestions is expected in our December product release. Separately, I would like to provide an update on JiHu, our China joint venture. Our goal remains to deconsolidate JiHu. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or timing of when this may potentially occur. Thus, for modeling purposes for FY ‘24, we now forecast approximately $22 million of expenses related to JiHu, compared with $19 million in FY ‘23. Excluding the impact of JiHu, we anticipate GitLab will be non-GAAP operating income breakeven in FY24. In closing, I’m pleased with our business momentum driven by our market-leading platform approach and commitment to capturing our large market opportunity. Chris, our new CRO, has led consistent execution with our sales teams and partners to drive a strong quarter. Looking forward, we continue to prioritize driving revenue growth in a responsible manner. With that, we will now move to Q&A. To ask a question please use the chat feature and post your question directly to IR Questions. We are ready for the first question.\nOperator: In the essence of time, we do request everyone to limit themselves to one question. And our first question comes from Koji with Bank of America.\nKoji Ikeda: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. A couple of times in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned enterprise agile planning. I thought that was pretty interesting that you guys are highlighting that. So curious to hear what you believe the opportunity is there. Is this a big replacement opportunity? How do we think about that? I believe it's included in the pricing model. Just want to make sure we understand the opportunity here on the planning side. Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah, thanks for the question. We're really thrilled about this market opportunity. With enterprise agile planning, we bring portfolio and project management capabilities into the same platform where the engineers work, and it is included in our ultimate pricing today. But we introduced a new SKU where we can reach a different non-engineering audience, people who will use the enterprise agile planning, but not the DevSec and Ops features. And we've shown that we can migrate thousands of these planning users successfully. I want to note it's still very early days for this. So our guidance includes the limited anticipated impact for Q4. This is a long-term strategy that will take some time to come to fruition. The biggest impact is not expected in the coming fiscal year, but in the years after.\nKoji Ikeda: Thank you.\nOperator: Up next, we have Karl with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Congratulations on the results. Sid, I'll pose this question to you. One of the interesting things I thought you said on the last earnings call was that you suggested that we might be at the very beginning of a displacement cycle for Atlassian Jira, and you called out a large bank that was, in fact, beginning to do that. With the passage of another three months, Sid, do you mind updating us on that? Is there any further evidence that's giving you conviction that that's, in fact, starting to happen? Any other anecdotes or metrics you could share?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah, thanks for asking. We're very pleased with our pipeline for this -- for enterprise agile planning in this new SKU we have, and it's being helped by Atlassian's end of support for their server product. Because of that being deprecated, a lot of customers are taking stock of where they're at. And they're not even always moving to GitLab self-managed, sometimes they move to GitLab SaaS, but it is a time, a natural point for them to evaluate. And they see the advantage of bringing together their planning users with their engineers, security people and operations people. The tighter those work together, the faster the cycle time.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike at Needham.\nMike Cikos: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I did just want to double check. So the first piece there, Brian, I appreciate the update. It sounds like the premium price queue increase is tracking in line with expectations. Just wanted to see if there was any more color you could you could parse out there and if that in any way or your assumptions for that premium price SKU has changed when we think about that Q4 guidance you guys are putting out there today. Would just like to tackle that first. Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, thanks Mike. We're happy with the performance of the premium price SKU. It's in line with what we modeled. One of the things that we've noted is first orders, especially in SMB and mid-market, are lower than expected and you'll see some of that in the base customers of greater than 5K, but overall we're happy with the premium price impact and it's in line with our expectations.\nMike Cikos: Thanks for that. And on the SMB and mid-market as well, is there any way you could help us think about -- I think you cited that with the elongated deal cycles we saw on a sequential basis, so can you help us think about what is the company's revenue exposure to those SMB and mid-market customers as well as when that elongation did start to show itself? And I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, the enterprise percentage of the total has remained pretty consistent. It's around 60% of the total base. And then PubSec is a little over 10%. So SMB and mid-market makes up the remainder.\nMike Cikos: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now hear from Ryan at Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. One for Brian and one for Sid. Brian, great to see the strong improvement in net retention. Just for modeling purposes, what was the benefit to the net retention number from the premium price increase? And for Sid, I was just wondering, when it comes to the new capabilities and interest from your customers around Generative AI, has that shifted at all their calculus between choosing between like self-hosted or the cloud? Just love to see maybe how they're thinking about that decision. Thanks.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, I'll take the dollar-based net retention first. And so, I wanted to call out, we've made a change in the way that we've calculated dollar-based net retention rate this quarter to better reflect the business itself. And so, this quarter, if you did the old way, be flat 124% to 124%. But the new way basically takes into the account, the account hierarchies. The old way that we did it actually kept a static view of the parent accounts. And if there was a merger, a new subsidiary, division being shut down or something, that actually showed a churn and then a new business. And so the change that we made, it's important to note, doesn't change the business at all. It just shifts between growth and new to give a better reflection of what's going on in the business. This is reflected in our 10-Q for Q1 and Q2. And so you can see the disclosures there. But under the old method was 124% to 124%. And under the new method, it's 128%. Sid, over to you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks. Regarding AI and SaaS versus self-managed, you're able to do SaaS and AI self-managed with the AI on SaaS. And we also plan to have some of the AI features available purely self-managed. The way to keep, like most things will ship SaaS first only, then come to self-managed using SaaS for AI and then go to self-managed if they go there at all. What we are very positive about is our dedicated offering because it combines the convenience of SaaS and then having a single tenant installation with the increased kind of security posture that comes with that. I think that's going to be a great solve, but we want to make sure that in the interim, our self-managed customers can use the AI features on SaaS, even if they keep having their self-managed installation. So that's a that's a priority for us.\nRyan MacWilliams: Excellent. Yeah, we've heard really good feedback on Gitlab Dedicated. Brian, just real quick on that 128%, under the new method, what was the net retention the prior quarter? And just if you could parse out what the contribution was from the price increase or like a general range, that'd be helpful just on net retention side. Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, so there -- there'll be an RQ, we'll follow up later today. It was roughly about the same flat quarter-to-quarter. And we don't break out the difference. Well, I guess from a price increase perspective, we don't break that out in particular, but one of the things I talked about is in the net dollar retention rate, what the percentage was between seat change, price change and tier change. Historically, seat change has been roughly about 50%. Price change and tier change have been 25%. Because of the price increase, the price change now makes up roughly about a third of the total of the net dollar retention rate. The seat change is a little less than 50%. And then the tier change is a little less than 25%.\nRyan MacWilliams: Excellent, thank you guys.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now hear from Kash with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hey, thank you very much. Happy holidays. Great to see the results. Sid, question for you. It looks like the tone -- your tone and confidence level and conviction level in going after the comparative opportunity with Atlassian and Microsoft is actually stronger than before. I'm curious what gives you the conviction to pursue that comparativeness and what are things that GitLab has to do from a product perspective and a go-to-market perspective to be able to take advantage of what you consider to be these nascent opportunities? And second and final, the -- we were waiting for Google to more closely align or for you to closely align your Generative AI efforts with Google. How close or how far are we from a full blown integration and announcement of sorts? Thank you so much.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Cash. Yeah, the customer feedback on our AI functionality has been positive. And as you might have heard in the prepared remarks, customers like NatWest and Nasdaq are using it in their engineering teams and seeing the value and the productivity and efficiency that it brings. Our customers have reported efficiency improvements upwards of 50% with code suggestions. We recently spoke with a leading international travel agency and they said that the features they tested, they believe that GitLab offers a better quality there. We also spoke with a multinational financial technology company, and their team is excited about using GitLab DO for generating configurations, test generation, bug finding, and automating operational work. So we're very excited that we have a broad platform so that we can do AI across the life cycle with 14 features for customers available today. You're muted.\nKash Rangan: Sorry, the other question, the competitiveness against Atlassian and Microsoft, what are the things you have to do from a product and go-to-market perspective to really take advantage of the opportunity that you see, the replacement opportunity?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah, I think apart from AI, I think it's really unique to GitLab to have better security and compliance. Our features like SaaS and DaaS, container scanning API security compliance management are unique to GitLab. We also talked about the planning and management features. We talked about enterprise agile planning, but also think of value stream management and Dora metrics that are all unique to GitLab as a DevOps platform. And for example, we had a Q3 deal at a European telecom. We partnered there with AWS and we won against GitHub.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much. Happy holidays.\nSid Sijbrandij: You too.\nOperator: Nick with Scotiabank is next.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks guys. I wanted to build on Ryan's question just around the Generative AI functionality with GitLab Duo. It sounds like there's not going to be really any difference in feature functionality and sort of folding in some of the new enhancements into SaaS and self-manage, but I wanted to ask how you guys think about layering additional feature functionality into premium versus ultimate and whether there's going to be kind of any difference there? And then just as a follow-up to that as you sort of layer in more functionality into that ultimate SKU more broadly, how do you think about pricing? Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah, I think our code suggestions I think is very comparable to a market. But I think what's unique about GitLab is having 14 AI features in the platform available to customers today. I think that's a big differentiation. As for how do we sell it, some features will be a different SKU, for example code suggestions and that's then available not just to ultimate and premium but also free customers that might be not paying for GitLab today. I think that's an exciting opportunity especially over the long term. And then some of the features we're going to put into ultimate or premium and there might even be extra SKUs we introduce in the future.\nNick Altmann: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Michael with KeyBanc is next.\nMichael Turits: Hey everybody, good evening. Hey Brian, hey everybody. So given some of that weakness you did call out in SMB from sales cycle and the size perspective, can you just be a little bit more specific about what really drove the upside in the quarter, you still call it an enterprise and or public and how that might be related to some of the things we've seen more broadly this quarter with cloud optimizations seeming to stabilize and some of the cloud consumption model companies seem to do better?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah, if you look at cloud consumption, it's an increasing part of our business, but it's currently a relatively small part of our business. So we aren't materially affected by the cloud consumption stabilizing.\nMichael Turits: Right. I guess I meant more from the general demand perspective. In other words, people are using more cloud. Is that driving more need, demand for GitLab subscriptions, seats, et cetera? And again, what's really offsetting that SMB weakness that drove the upside in the quarter?\nSid Sijbrandij: I think that with GitLab, it has the biggest benefit the more complex your organization is. So the more complex your security and governance, the more heterogeneity in your projects where you go from kind of having projects on mainframe to the latest agile, that is where we can really shine. By bringing that all together in one platform, we typically see a 7x acceleration of cycle time. So give us the hardest problems, that's where we shine. And the enterprises are having the hardest time of kind of having to move really fast, having all these things they have to move at the same time, but having the most compliance and security questions to do. We do believe if you look at the overall market, software is just going to keep getting more complex. You get AI now, you'll have more regulatory friction coming for everyone. So that gives us a lot of optimism about the future.\nMichael Turits: Thanks, Sid.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Ethan with Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, Thanks for taking my question. Kind of filling in here for Rob this afternoon. I just wanted to kind of talk about kind of on the same topic of cloud optimizations and as these kind of come to maybe start to slow down, how are companies thinking about ramping the velocity of new development projects, especially as we head into 2024. I'd just be curious to hear how you -- customer conversations have been trending on that topic. Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: I think there's a lot of focus on ROI, like how do we do more and what measures should we look at? One of the best practices today is DORA metrics, looking for example at how frequently can we deploy. Also, cycle time is becoming really important for customers. How fast can I go from planning something to getting it out there? We've learned as an industry not to focus on lines of code written. It's not a good metric to measure efficiency. And with GitLab, you're able to look at those value stream metrics much more easily because you have everything in a single platform. And you're able to say, hey, if I move to GitLab, I know I'm able to make faster progress against my most important initiatives.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it, thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt with RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great, thanks for taking my question guys. Congrats from me as well. Maybe for either of you, one of the drivers that we think about over the next several years is free to paid. I think you guys have changed slightly sort of how you think about free-to-pay usage within your base. Can you talk a little bit more about that philosophically and are you seeing any benefit from that in the Q3 results?\nBrian Robins: Yeah Matt, I'll take that. Thanks for the question. And so we did implement a user limit on GitLab.com, and it's led good conversion from free to paid. However, the vast majorities fall below $5,000, the base customer limit that we report, and so the impact is relatively low. We're continuing to, pursue that product-led growth. We think it will be built into our guidance. And so that's on free to paid. I'll also take this as just an opportunity. I know a lot of you have had a wide range of outputs in the model for FY 2025 related to the Premium price increase. We're halfway through our planning process right now. So we aren't giving guidance for next year. It's still a bit early. But the early work that we've done, we believe that the Premium price increase will contribute roughly $10 million to $20 million in revenue for next year. And so it should help you out from a modeling perspective.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thanks, guys. Great detail.\nBrian Robins: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Joel with Truist is up next.\nJoel Fishbein: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Sid, you mentioned on the call the AWS deal where you beat out GitHub. I would love to get a little bit more color on the partnerships and -- with Google and AWS and how that go-to-market is working and maybe some updates from you there in terms of maybe driving some deal sizes, et cetera. Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks, Joel. So we've got strong partnerships with both Google and AWS. And they're interested because we help their customers move to their cloud faster. We help them accelerate moving those workloads. And an interesting thing we did with Google recently, we announced at Google Next that they'll be integrating GitLab into their development console for GCP. I think that's a really interesting development that will pay off as many things over the longer term. I think it speaks to the strength of these partnerships together with the AWS example I mentioned earlier.\nJoel Fishbein: Just a quick follow-up. Can you just explain to us how -- maybe [Amazon Q] (ph), you may work in conjunction with that as a part of being a competitive product? That would be helpful as well. Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah, for sure. We're going to make sure -- we're discussing with Amazon how we can Q work really well with GitLab.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Joel.\nOperator: Pinjalim with JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just one question for me. Ultimately, ARR seems like it was a big number, 50% of ARR, if I heard that correctly. It seems like a big uptick sequentially. Has the Premium price increase actually driven kind of a big upgrade cycle for you on Ultimate? Or I guess I can think of the reverse as well. Has Premium seat growth slowed dramatically sequentially?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. A couple of things there to unpack. Thanks for the questions. Just for clarity, we said in the prepared remarks that Ultimate bookings were greater than 50% of the total bookings. Ultimate ARR comprises of 43% of the total. And Ultimate continues to be our fastest-growing tier, primarily as it relates to our security and compliance that's found within Ultimate. And so I hope that helps out from a clarity standpoint.\nPinjalim Bora: That does. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next is Gregg with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Thank you for taking the questions. Regarding GitLab Duo, just wondering if there are any usage updates that you might be able to share for Suggested Reviewers or some of the other features. And then secondly, in your recent state of AI in software development report, which really is excellent, by the way, there were a lot of interesting data points. One that caught my eye is that more than half of respondents said that they think AI will replace their role within the next five years. And I'm wondering if that in any way changes the way in which you're thinking about the impact that GenAI could have on the number of seats over a longer-term basis, of course. Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks for that. I think that another really interesting thing that was in that study is that AI needs to be throughout the life cycle and for multiple things, like only 25% of the time of a developer spend on coding, 75% is other tasks. And as developers get more productive, they write more code, you need to also increase the productivity of security and operations. So we're focused on making it work throughout the life cycle. I think you'll see parts of roles being replaced. But what also will happen is that creating software will get more affordable. And I think that will also lead to an increase in the amount of software we're writing. If something becomes more affordable, sometimes consumption goes up and the overall number of people involved increases. We still see a lot of units being needed in even the medium term. And the productivity going up might be a good thing for the number of people in this sector.\nGregg Moskowitz: That’s helpful. Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks.\nOperator: Next is Andrew with Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. It's Andrew on for Derrick. Sid, your Dedicated offering has been GA since June. Could you talk about demand trends there? You mentioned the big eight-figure deal. That's great to hear. Talk about how large of a growth driver next year this could be. Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks. We're really excited about Dedicated. For everyone's -- as a reminder, it combines the best of Gitlab.com and self-managed to get -- we manage it like gitlab.com, but just like self-managed or a single tenant, you have increased isolation and increased security through that. So we believe it's a huge opportunity, especially to convert our current self-managed customers. I think it's going to play out over many years. So we're just at the starting point. We are signing those large deals that Brian mentioned, eight-figure TCV expansion in the automotive space. We see more coming. And I think there's a huge opportunity there considering the majority of our revenue comes from self-managed today. And for the larger self-managed customers, this is a great option.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Peter with Bernstein.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. I think over the last quarter, you talked about kind of several exciting things both with Google and AWS, specifically the integration of GitLab into Google Cloud console and AWS introducing support for GitLab and AWS code pipeline. How can we think about the initial impact of these relationships, either being seen in new or existing customers? I mean, are we seeing more contracts through Google Cloud and AWS? Or how should we think about that?\nBrian Robins: Yeah, I'm happy to start on that. We have several ways that we go to market, and through the hyperscalers is one way. As I've mentioned before, the business that they bring us is somewhat lumpy in nature because they're selling to a wide base of customers. But I'm happy to report that they almost increased their bookings year-over-year by almost -- approximately 100%. And so we had great contributions from them this quarter. And so we continue to work with them on enablement. We're also technology partners with them as well. And so we have a pretty broad-based partnership with both hyperscalers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Thank you. Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask you, excuse me, on the single DevOps platform vision that you've been talking about for many years now. It seems that there is consolidation happening certainly from a tools perspective, Sid. But it doesn't sound like larger enterprises really want a single DevOps tool. They want -- maybe instead of 15 or 20, they want 4 or 5. First of all, do you agree with that? Do you think that could change over time. And then for the mid-market, so under that 60% that's not large enterprise, how realistic is it for those customers? And any evidence so far that they are gravitating towards that sort of single DevOps platform vision?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. I would say like it's happening -- it's finally happening. People have gotten the message, the consolidation is happening. Some of them indeed are like, hey, we've got 15 tools. We've got to go to five. The best ones, the most advanced ones, they get it. It's just the movement will continue. The next thing is from 5 to 1, and we have seen customers doing that and having seen customers getting amazing results. Like the more they consolidate, the more they save. The more they consolidate, the faster their cycle time. We haven't gotten every single customer there yet. And it's going to be really important to continue to be an open platform, open to Code Suggestions everywhere in our code base, open to having great APIs and open to having very many integrations. We never want to allow customers in. But we know that the more they consolidate, the better the outcomes are. And we'll keep beating that drum, and we'll try to make sure the majority of the market gets there. I think the analysts are now also repeating the message with Gartner creating a DevOps platform category.\nJason Ader: Is it fair to say that -- so source code Management CI, that's sort of an obvious consolidation point. Is -- for your larger enterprise customers, is it security and compliance that's sort of next on the list in terms of putting it into that bundle?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah, I think that's -- every customer is different, but people have gotten the message in dev development. The shift is now happening in security, bringing Dev and Sec together. But the writing is on the wall. Eventually, it's going to be DevSecOps all together in one platform. And that's -- we're kind of spreading that cost on.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you. Good luck.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you.\nOperator: We have four minutes remaining in the Q&A. Gray with BTIG is next.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you very much. Maybe a question on the margin side of things. So if I'm looking at the updated guidance, for every dollar of new revenue that you add this year, a little over 50% of that is flowing through to the operating income line. Can you talk about what the main drivers of leverage are this year? And then is there any reason that, that trend would not continue in the next year?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. Great. Thanks for your question. Super happy big milestone in company history. This is our first quarter of non-GAAP operating income positive. Since we were on the road show, in every quarter, we reemphasized the message, number one goal is to grow, and we'll do that responsibly. And so we've been continuing getting -- continuing to get operating leverage out of the model. For instance, in Q3 year-over-year, we added approximately $37 million of revenue for $10 million of additional expense, and we achieved non-GAAP operating income positive of $4.7 million. And so as I mentioned earlier, we're early in the process of FY '25. We'll give FY '25 guidance on our fourth quarter call. And so we'll continue to operate in a disciplined manner.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you very much.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Allan with Wolfe Research.\nAllan Verkhovski: Hey guys. Just a quick last question for me. Brian, that $10 million to $20 million is the comment you made to next year's numbers from the pricing increase was really helpful. Would love to understand what gross turn or NRR has been for Premium customers renewing over the last few quarters? And what kind of rough assumptions are you using to get to that $10 million to $20 million next year?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. So similar to what we walked through before, where we took a certain amount of bookings, we saw when they're coming up for renewal, what the stage would be with the one year for existing customers and then the price increase for new customers and then taking an average of -- our average contract term right now is roughly about 15 months and in building that waterfall model. And so I've talked about historically that it is ratable, and you have to build the ratable sort of nature of the waterfall out. Since there's been so many estimates that have come out in the various models, we thought it would be good just to quantify what the impact for next year would be to help you with modeling.\nAllan Verkhovski: Thank you.\nOperator: Jonathan with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you. So I wanted to ask about the concept of software bill of materials. We've seen a lot of software supply chain attacks. I think the Biden administration's executive order really seem to elevate importance of software supply chain security. So I'm just kind of curious how you see that playing out in the market. And then the second part of that question is CycloneDX is an open-source tool that a lot of companies can use to create these [Dev bombs] (ph). So I believe you used that tool. So beyond that, where do you look to differentiate?\nSid Sijbrandij: So we have software build of materials in GitLab today. It's a super important thing to know what you're using within a company. For example, in GitLab, you can also have allow list and deny list based on the licenses that software has. Of course, it also has security implications. We help customers with that too. A feature that will be coming out from us is the ability to have a global SBOM, kind of aggregate the SBOMs throughout your company, deduplicate it and get that overall view, which I think we will be one of the first with -- one of the first companies to do that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes our Q3 FY '24 earnings presentation. Thanks again once more for joining us. Have a great day. Good bye."

A replay of today's call will also be posted on ir.gitlab.com. I will now turn the call over to GitLab's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sid Sijbrandij.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong quarter. Revenue grew 38% year-over-year and we continue to demonstrate significant operating leverage in our model. We also reached a major milestone. Gartner and Forrester issued reports officially recognizing DevOps platforms. This is the category we created. And these reports validate the category's significance and importance. We also proved that the market is moving from point solutions to platforms. I'm thrilled with where these industry analysts place GitLab within the category. We were named a leader in the Gartner, Magic, Quadrant for DevOps platforms and we scored the highest in our ability to execute of all the participants. And we were the only leader in the Forrester Wave integrated software delivery platforms. These reports show significant momentum for GitLab. We also reinforced a consistent team right here. Customers want to develop better, faster and more secure software and we want to do more with less. I'd like to discuss key topics today. First, how we're innovating to create further differentiation for our DevSecOps platform. Second, how we're capturing the large DevSecOps opportunity with a strong go-to-market motion. And third, how we are continuing to drive responsible growth in the business, and Brian will cover this topic in even more detail. We help our GitLab 16 product launch event last quarter. We share new features and capabilities of our AI-powered DevSecOps platform. We'll also discussed the road map for the coming year. GitLab is uniquely able to help companies overcome the complexity of developing software. One area on which we focused was compliance. Our DevSecOps platform helps compliance leaders set the right controls and governance frameworks. We shared several new compliance capabilities. These include centralized policy management, expanded reports and controls, and compliance dashboards. Another focus area was security, GitLab enables companies to strengthen their software supply chain security. Point solutions make it difficult for teams to ship software faster while maintaining strong security. In contrast, our DevSecOps platform enables companies to shift their security practices left and do it earlier in the life cycle. It helps developers catch vulnerabilities earlier in the development process. Please let me provide a customer example. BetterCloud is a market-leading SaaS workflow automation platform. They turn to GitLab to secure their software supply chain. In Q2, they renewed their business with GitLab to consolidate the fragmented tool chain. And as a result, BetterCloud deprecated multiple security point solution providers. This strengthened data security posture while also enhancing automation and increasing developer satisfaction. GitLab enables customers to make their software more secure without sacrificing speed. This differentiated value proposition resonates across all verticals. One particular example is the public sector. Speed to mission is imperative in this vertical. GitLab customer, Navy Black Pearl demonstrates this value proposition well. Navy Black Pearl is a DevSecOps service developed and managed by Sigma Defense. This service creates mission applications for the U.S. Department of Navy. Black Pearl uses GitLab to quickly create new applications and continuously modify code in response to evolving requirements and priorities. Using GitLab, Navy Black Pearls' teams have designed and created custom operational software environments within days rather than months. Many of our customers have complex security compliance and regulatory requirements. We address these needs with GitLab Dedicated. This is a single-tenant SaaS offering that became generally available in Q2. With GitLab Gilad Dedicated, we fully managed and deploy the DevSecOps platform, and this enables customers to save on operational costs. It also provides the control and compliance of a self-hosted solution. GitLab Dedicated offers full data and source code isolation, data residency and private networking. Let me provide another customer example. One of the world's leading advisory and asset management firms choose GitLab Dedicated over GitHub in Q2. They had a SaaS first initiative. Their security teams would not allow a multi-tenant SaaS solution. They choose us because GitLab Dedicated met their security and compliance requirements. GitLab Dedicated also enabled this customer to accomplish other objectives. These include eliminating duplicate tools, increasing operational efficiency and accelerating their move to the cloud. GitLab integrates all aspects of software development into the same platform. Customers can improve their productivity and efficiency across the entire life cycle. This includes enterprise agile planning and value stream management. In Q2, we expanded business with a multinational financial services company. The customer wanted to drive greater efficiency by integrating an enterprise agile planning solution with the rest of their software development practices. They moved thousands of business users from Jira (ph) to GitLab. AI continues to be a key area of product innovation. We are developing AI-powered capabilities across the entire software development life cycle. Let me share just a few of these capabilities. Court suggestions uses generative AI to suggest code to developers, suggested reviewers leverages AI to identify the most appropriate reviewers of code. Explain this vulnerability provides details about potential security vulnerabilities in code. And code suggestions remains on track to be generally available later this year. We differentiate our approach to AI in several ways. We have a commitment to privacy and transparency in our use of AI and we also deliver AI throughout the entire software development life cycle. Today, we released the findings of our state of DevSecOps study. This study illustrates the importance of our AI differentiation even further. In June 2023, we surveyed more than 1,000 respondents. These include individual contributors and leaders in software development, IT operations and security. We found that 79% of respondents are concerned about AI tools, accessing private information or intellectual property. We also found that developers only spend 25% of their time writing code, that's why we believe delivering AI beyond just code suggestions is essential. The second topic I want to discuss is how we intend to capture the large DevSecOps market opportunity with a strong go-to-market motion. Strategic partnerships are an important part of our go-to-market execution and I would like to highlight Google Cloud and AWS (ph) as two of the most significant. GitLab and Google Cloud are strongly committed to delivering secure enterprise AI offerings across the software development life cycle. We are thrilled to be working with Google Cloud on delivering our vision of AI-powered workflows. We are leveraging [indiscernible] foundational models, including the new coding model family to deliver new AI-powered experiences to all users involved in creating secure software. Our partnership with Google extends even further. At this year's Google Cloud Next. We announced our plans to integrate GitLab into the Google Cloud console. GitLab also received the 2023 Google Cloud Partner of the Year Award for the third consecutive year. Google recognized GitLab for our achievements in application development within the Google Cloud ecosystem. Another key partner is AWS. In Q2, AWS introduced support for GitLab in AWS code pipeline. This is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery service. This new AWS capability allows developers to leverage their gitlab.com source code repository to build, test and deploy co-changes with AWS code pipeline. Last quarter, we also embarked on our DevSecOps world tour. We're taking GitLab on the road to 14 cities in four countries. These events bring together developers, security and operations technology leaders. They can learn how organizations use GitLab to build more secure software faster, we're happy to feature many partner and customer speakers. Examples include Delta Airlines, Lendlease and Cisco. In Q2, we announced the appointment of Chris Weber as our Chief Revenue Officer. Chris brings more than 20 years of sales leadership experience from Microsoft. This includes building multi-billion-dollar sales organizations. Chris’ customer-first approach will be instrumental as GitLab skills in our next phase of growth. In closing, I'm pleased with our second quarter results. They demonstrate continued momentum and solidify our category leadership. With our recent analyst and customer validation, we are well positioned to win in the estimated $40 billion market opportunity. I'd like to thank our customers for trusting GitLab. And also like to thank our team members, partners and the wider GitLab lab community for their contributions this quarter. I'll now turn it over to Brian Robins, GitLab's Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian Robins: Thank you, Sid, and thank you again for everyone joining us today. I'm very happy with our key metrics in Q2 and that our revenue grew 38% year-over-year. I'd like to emphasize, it's point about driving responsible growth as we achieved over 2,300 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We continue to find ways to become more efficient while scaling the business to address our large market opportunity. We also continue to make target investments in key product areas. These include security, compliance, AI and agile planning. Part of our responsible growth strategy is to continue to optimize our pricing and packaging. In April of this year, we raised the price of our premium SKU for the first time in five years. Over that time frame, we added over 400 new features. We believe this better aligns price with value for our customers and the investment we made over the past five years. In the first four months post-launch, customer behavior was in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we anticipate minimal impact to our financials from this change in the current year. We expect the price increase to have a much larger impact in FY '25 and beyond. Looking back at the quarter. I want to touch on customer buying patterns, contraction and ultimate trends. First, customer purchasing behavior in Q2 was consistent with Q1 of FY '24. We believe buying patterns appear to have stabilized. Second, contraction was lower than Q1 of FY '24 and appears to be stabilizing. Third, ultimate, our top tier continues to see strong adoption driven by customer wins for security and compliance use cases. Now turning to the numbers. Revenue of $139.6 million this quarter represents an increase of 38% organically from Q2 of the prior year. We ended Q2 with over 7,800 customers with ARR of at least 5,000 compared to over 7,400 customers in the first quarter of FY '24. This compares to over 5,800 customers in Q2 of the prior year. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 33%. Currently, customers with greater than $5,000 in ARR represent approximately 95% of our total ARR. We also measure the performance and growth of our larger customers, who we define as spending more than $100,000 in ARR with us. At the end of the second quarter of FY '24, we had 810 customers with ARR of at least $100,000 (ph) compared to 760 customers in Q1 of FY '24. This compares to 593 customers in the second quarter of FY '23. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 37%. As many of you know, we do not believe calculated billings to be a good indicator of our business given that our prior period comparisons can be impacted by a number of factors, most notably our history of large prepaid multi-year deals. This quarter, total RPO grew 37% year-over-year to $496 million. cRPO grew 34% to $335 million for the same time frame. We ended our second quarter with a net dollar based retention rate of 124%. As a reminder, this is a trailing 12-month metric that compares expansion activity of customers over the last 12 months with that same cohort of customers during the prior 12-month period. The ultimate tier continues to be our fastest growing tier, representing 42% of ARR for the second quarter of FY '24, compared with 39% of ARR in the second quarter of FY '23. Non-GAAP gross margins were 91% of the quarter, which is consistent with the preceding quarter. This is a slight improvement from second quarter of FY '23. SaaS represents over 25% of ARR. We have been able to maintain best-in-class non-GAAP gross margins despite the higher cost of SaaS delivery. This is another example of how we continue to drive efficiencies in the business. We saw improved operating leverage this quarter, largely driven by realizing greater efficiencies as we continue to scale the business. Non-GAAP operating loss of $4.3 million or negative 3% of revenue compared to a loss of $27 million or negative 27% of revenue in 2Q of last year. This includes an operating loss of $3.2 million for JiHu, our JV and majority-owned subsidiary. On a stand-alone GitLab basis, the operating loss was $1.1 million. We generated positive operating cash flow of $27.1 million in the second quarter of FY '24, compared to a $36.3 million use of cash in operating activities in the same quarter of last year. Now let's turn to guidance. We're assuming that the trends in the business we have seen over the last few quarters continue. There has been no change to our overall guidance loss (ph). For the third quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue of $140 million to $141 million, representing a growth rate of 24% to 25% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $6 million to $5 million and we expect a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.02 to $0.01, assuming 155 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year FY '24, we now expect total revenue of $555 million to $557 million, representing a growth rate of approximately 31% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $33 million to $30 million and we expect non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.08 to $0.05, assuming 154 million weighted average shares outstanding. Excluding the impact of JiHu, it's likely that GitLab will reach breakeven on a non-GAAP operating income basis in third quarter of FY '24. On a percentage basis, our new annual FY '24 guidance implies a non-GAAP operating improvement of approximately 1,500 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint of our guidance. We believe that our continued focus on responsible growth will yield further improvements in our unit economics. We remain on track to achieve free cash flow breakeven for FY '25. There are a number of drivers we are introducing that we believe should help fuel our business in FY '25. I touched on the first one earlier, which is the price increase in our premium tier. Additionally, in Q2, we started enforcing user limits on our free sized tier. It's early, but we have seen additional free users upgrade to premium. The third driver is the launch of Dedicated. This allows us to address new opportunity for companies with complex security and compliance requirements. Finally, we plan to monetize our AI capabilities by launching an add-on that will include co-suggestions functionality later this year. Separately, I would like to provide an update on JiHu, our China joint venture. Our goal remains to deconsolidate JiHu. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or timing of when this may potentially occur. Thus, for modeling purposes for FY '24, we now forecast approximately $25 million of expenses related to JiHu compared with $19 million in FY '23. In closing, I'm pleased with our continued business momentum. We believe the value proposition of our market-leading DevSecOps platform is resonating in the market. Looking forward, we continue to prioritize driving revenue growth in a responsible manner. With that, we'll now move to Q&A. To ask a question, please use the chat feature and post your questions directly to IR questions. We're ready for the first question.\nA - Sharlene Seemungal: Our first question comes from Sterling at MoffettNathanson.\nBilly Fitzsimmons: Hey, guys. This is actually Billy Fitzsimmons on for Sterling Auty. I kind of say you look great, and I hope you're doing well. In terms of the question, Sid for you, obviously, a few months ago, the firm had discussion with investors to talk through the generative AI-based products and then you gave us an update on Duo in AI in the prepared remarks. But maybe double-clicking and going a little deeper, and I can imagine we're still in the early innings here. But curious if you could talk through kind of early customer feedback on these products' adoption trends, what you're hearing and seeing? And then if I could sneak another one in, maybe for you Brian. Obviously, earlier this year, you announced a price increase in the way that's structured a lot of that won't be felt until fiscal 2025 and 2026. But now that it's been several months, can you maybe give us an update on kind of what you're seeing and hearing from customers on the price increase, retention trends and stuff like that? Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks for the question. And the early feedback to Duo has been very positive. Customers get that they need AI features not just, for example, coding, but they need it throughout the DevOps life cycle. And we've just published a report actually, we're publishing it today, the state of DevOps. And even for developers, which is only kind of a third of a DevSecOps platform, only 25% of their time is spent coding, 75% of their time is elsewhere. So it's really important to have a set of features throughout the life cycle. We're really happy that we have 10 features out there already. And some of the oldest feature we have suggested reviewers has over 100,000 users today. So we're excited about progressing that further. And it's great to see that customers recognize that they need a suite of AI features, and therefore, we're excited about Duo.\nBrian Robins: And on the price increase, last quarter when we had our call, we only had a month of data. So happy to say we have three months of data this quarter and I'm happy with the results. It's been in line to slightly above our expectations. As a reminder, we implemented the price increase because we put 400 new features in the platform and we wanted that to match the value that we are providing to our customer. And so the guidance that we provided for this quarter as well as the full year includes that impact. When we went -- when we announced the price increase, we talked about just due to the ratable nature of the revenue and renewals coming up through the year, there would be very little impact in FY 2024 and the majority of the impact would come in FY 2025 with all the impact realized in the year of FY 2026.\nBilly Fitzsimmons: Perfect. Thank you, both.\nSharlene Seemungal: Our next question comes from Michael at KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys. Good evening. From a macro perspective, perhaps you can talk about where we are in terms of a couple of factors. One, the pace of new application development, especially with cloud optimization seeming to slow, but still there, the application development and then also developer seats and where -- your perception where we are relative to that as a driver for you?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. I'm happy to go through the seats and then Sid, if you want to go through application development that would be great. Just on the seats in general, I would say that we've seen more stabilization in Q2 over Q1. With that said though, the buying patterns of customers has changed, right? And we talked about this a number of different quarters. And people are buying for what they have currently hired today and they're only buying for products that they have funded in the plan. And so we factor that into our guidance, the overall macro. And so that's included in our third quarter guidance as well the full year guidance. Maybe you can just repeat your question on the application development for Sid, that would be great.\nMichael Turits: Sure. Sid, the question was to the extent that we've seen cloud optimization slowing, I think, but maybe not done. Where do you think we are in terms of the pace of application development in the cloud and how that is or isn't helping to drive your business?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. I think that cloud optimization has been a lot of kind of consumption patterns that were hit. I think we were less -- much less impacted by that. We do have seen the decline of kind of the expansion of kind of hiring more developers and things like that. I think that's been a headwind for us. And I think as far as moving application development to the cloud, I think we still have a long way to go. We regularly partner with big companies, and they still have a lot of things that need to move to modern practices. A lot of things are still not DevOps. They're still not cloud native. So there's still a big shift ahead of us.\nMichael Turits: I’ll leave it there. Those are sort of two question. So thanks everybody.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Michael\nSharlene Seemungal: Next, we have Joel from Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Brian, one for you. Just a great job on the operating leverage side. Just wanted to understand puts and takes in 3Q and the rest of the year on that operating margin line, notwithstanding JiHu, which I know is going to hopefully be deconsolidated at some point.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Joel for the question. Sid and I have been very consistent in our messaging before we went public in every quarter since going public, that our number one goal is to grow, but we'll do that responsibly. And I'm super happy with the increased operating leverage that we continue to get in the business. This was a big milestone for GitLab this quarter. We achieved a non-GAAP EPS of positive $0.01. And so every other quarter, we've actually lost money. In Q2, just to show the operating leverage, we delivered approximately $30 million -- $39 million of incremental revenue over 2Q of last year. And we did that with $16 million of additional expense. If you look at first half of this year versus first half of last year, we've delivered approximately $130 million of revenue with only $70 million of additional expense, and both of those were adjusted for JiHu. In my prepared remarks, I did say it's likely that we'll reach non-GAAP operating income positive in 3Q. And then we also reconfirm and committed to being free cash flow positive in FY '25.\nJoel Fishbein: Great. Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nSharlene Seemungal: We will now move to Rob from Piper Sandler.\nRobbie Owens: Great. Thank you very much and thanks for taking my question. Brian, I just wanted to touch on the macro a little bit more. I appreciate the commentary and noting that NRR contracted again a little bit sequentially. So any guideposts you can put or rails around where that might go? I think you gave us a lot of indications around stabilization with behavior being consistent, some of the other metrics that you threw out. So just want to understand maybe where that NRR might bottom? And then for Sid, as you talk a little bit about the SaaS offering, noting it's still only 25% of your ARR, maybe help us understand what some of those key features might be that will drive more incremental SaaS demand. Thanks, guys.\nBrian Robins: I'll answer the NRR question first and turn it over to Sid to answer your second question. So as I mentioned earlier, we did see some stabilization in Q2 over Q1. Customers are still buying what they need. And so the fact that last year, they're buying a lot more, in this year, they're just buying what they need is why you're seeing a slight drop in the net dollar retention rate. I am happy to say that every year since we've launched is still expanding. And so customers are still buying more year-over-year than what they've bought historically. When you look at sort of -- I've talked about historically that the watch point in the business was around contraction, and that was primarily contraction expansion primarily in our premium seats. I'm happy this quarter, we actually had a very good expansion quarter. Contraction has leveled out and churn has always been much smaller. But both of those are reflected in the guidance going forward. We didn't give out sort of what a target number is, or where we think of bottom out. If you look in the business though, contraction started late in fourth quarter of last year. And so we're about three quarters into this. Average contract length is a little over 14 months. So I expect we have another quarter, 1.5 quarters ago until we work through the cycle of the new buying patterns.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks for that question. Rob, I understood it as like what's going to drive self-managed revenue to SaaS revenue. And I see two big things. I see Dedicated, our new offering, which is single-tenant SaaS. We have gitlab.com, which is multiple-tenant SaaS but to address the most complex compliance requirements. We're super excited about this new offering, and it's a great way to get our biggest customers with the most complex requirements up to the SaaS platform, where we maintain it for them. Another driver of the move to SaaS can be additional functionality for self-managed. We call this GitLab Plus and for example, some of the AI features will require a connection to GitLab SaaS in order to consume them. So there's more features that we've thought about, but not yet launched, but additional features to kind of get kind of a hybrid installation. Some of it is on-prem. Some of the new features are SaaS provided in the cloud and kind of gradually move those customers over.\nRobbie Owens: Great. Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Rob.\nSharlene Seemungal: Next, we have Koji from Bank of America.\nKoji Ikeda: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the analyzed category. When I looked at the investor presentation, it looks like this is a new category on the product page in the investor deck, and I really wanted to focus on the metrics logging and tracing. And I guess could you categorize what type or maybe category of vendor would you be competing with this product? And why would a customer go at GitLab for metrics, logging and traces versus maybe some of the other traditional vendors in that category? Thank you.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. Thanks for the question. So specifically the metrics logging and tracing. I think that's called the APM category, application performance management and popular vendors there are vendors like Datadog and New Relic. So over time, we'll be competing with them. But in the beginning, we'll start -- the features really basic with just very early functionality. So we're not as much competing with the big vendors. We're competing with nonconsumption. The alternative to GitLab would be just not setting up logging and metrics and things like that because the features we offer in the beginning is really -- are really basic. But because of our open core model where our customers can contribute -- over time, they will start contributing. Our last monthly release, GitLab 16.3 in August, it had 237 contributions from our customers across the platform. So over time, over many years, the functionality will improve, and the goal is to become best-in-class over time and compete with those best-in-class solutions.\nKoji Ikeda: Just one follow-up, if I may there. You mentioned APM just thinking a little bit further out, would there be any plans to maybe go into infrastructure monitoring or log analytics too. Thanks, Sid.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. If we do logging, logging analytics makes sense to me as a category. If you look at infrastructure, we already have infrastructure scope functionality. For example, our TerraForm (ph) support. So certainly something that has our attention.\nSharlene Seemungal: Next, we move on to Derek from Cowen.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks, guys. You've talked about vendor consolidation as a key opportunity for GitLab for some time. That theme has definitely popped up more across the software landscape since the macro hit over the last few quarters. Just wondering if that kind of cadence of business for you guys just picked up, if you have any metrics to share at all in terms of like a percentage of expansion business growing in terms of vendor displacement? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks for that. I'll let Brian add to my answer, but I think what we're seeing is that the market is starting to get it. And I think the introduction by Gartner and Forrester of this category of DevOps platform is going to be a real tailwind for us because it signifies to customers like this is the future. If you look at our 2022 state of DevOps report, 69% of organizations said they wanted to consolidate tool chains, but they don't want to compromise on functionality. So as GitLab gets more complete and is able to take on more point solutions, that is an amazing trend that the customers want to consolidate. Now the analysts are saying it, and we hope to go from kind of the early adopters to the early majority in that. Brian?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. And just to say a couple of extra words to what Sid said is absolutely. I think we're seeing this sort of in the customer journey, if you will. And so they're landing on premium, they're landing relatively small, they're actually then expanding to division departments within the company then ultimately upgrading Ultimate. And so the customer journey continues to show. Despite the macro when you think that people wouldn't be selecting a new technology or a new platform, this has really caused people to evaluate how they're developing software and exploring ways to make software better, faster, cheaper and more secure. And so I think what Sid said as well as what we're seeing just from a customer perspective is, we're continuing to see the vendor consolidation.\nDerrick Wood: Great. And just a follow-up is last quarter, you guys talked about more C-level involvement in purchase decision-making. Just curious how you've maybe tweak the go-to-market to adopt to that environment, especially in light of kind of a new leadership in place and maybe what kind of tweaks you'd be looking in the second half of this year?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. We don't have any major disruptions plan. It's been a very seamless transition in our go-to-market. But we are focused on those C-level buyers. And 1 thing we do is a value stream assessment where we go into the customer, map all their existing tools and kind of how we can gradually replace that, so that it's not a big bank, but they get it as renewals come up as they -- as we solve their biggest problems. And their biggest problems can be like my Jenkins installation can be upgraded, and it's a problem or I'm behind on security, so I need to integrate a set of security tools. Where I have the security tools, the compliance is it there? I can prove that. I've doing. So depending on what their needs are, we make a plan with them, and that frequently goes up to the highest level in the organization. Typically, middle management is engaged with kind of keeping their DIY solution up in the kind of up and running. So it's important for us to talk to those decision makers in the top.\nDerrick Wood: Perfect. Thank you.\nSharlene Seemungal: Next, we'll move on to Karl at UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Maybe I'll ask one for Brian and one for Sid. So Brian, on the 3Q revenue guide of $141 million at the high end, that's only up the smidge from your actual in 2Q. It's typically up double-digit on a percentage basis. So I wanted to ask -- was there anything that felt a little one-time-ish in 2Q or that's on your mind in 3Q that you'd like to call out? And then I'll -- maybe I'll follow up with Sid.\nBrian Robins: Yeah. Thanks for that Karl. There was nothing there was, if you look at 2Q revenue and go through, there was nothing that was anomalous sick in the revenue. I would just say 2Q is an actual and 3Q's guidance.\nKarl Keirstead: Yeah. Okay. Makes sense. Hey, Sid, you called out a Jira displacement in a large multinational bank. You don't often hear that and I think you and Brian have often said over the last couple of years that it's very early stage for GitLab to be displacing Jira software. Is there a change in that cadence.\nSid Sijbrandij: We're getting closer now. This was a proof point for us. The customer, as far as I know is very happy with the change. So we've gone from this just being something we hoped for to something that's happening. And what's happening is that people are moving from point solutions to a platform because you can get the cycle time up. And our enterprise portfolio management is good enough to replace Jira any instances, companies are also going from having like very complex work streams in Jira that needs lots of human sign-offs to automating more. For example, all those security scans or compliance management that, for example, you're going to force that every piece of code is reviewed by 2 people. Instead of signing off and check boxing in Jira with people you can all automate that, and that's what also enabling us to do that.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Congrats on the good results.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Karl.\nSharlene Seemungal: Next, we have Matt from RBC\nMatthew Hedberg: Great, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, Sid, you look great too, so that’s -- it’s really good to see that as well. I wanted to ask about -- I think, Brian, your comment was customer behavior and the premium price increases in line with expectations. I just wanted to double click on that a bit. What does that mean? Does that mean that they're just -- they're effectively taking the price increase? Are you seeing any -- I know it's not a factor, but typically that you've talked about, but are any moving to Ultimate? Just maybe a little bit more color on what in line with your expectations means?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. Absolutely, Matt. When we did the price increase, we did an internal model that looked at bookings, churn, and we came up with what we thought our forecast would be on the overall net bookings. And so I would say overall bookings is more positive than our internal forecast and churn is less. And so we're seeing positive signs on every element of how we modeled it from a bookings and churn perspective.\nMatthew Hedberg: Got it. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Dedicated. I believe last quarter, did you have -- I think you had two customers, two large customers on Dedicated. I think, Sid, maybe you mentioned that -- maybe just a little bit more color on number of customers there if you're giving that? And then I know there's a hosting layer to that. But sort of like what are you seeing from a customer spend perspective when they take dedicated?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. I think we're happy with the pipeline for Dedicated. Right now, you can only get Dedicated if you go for GitLab Ultimate and there is a minimum number of seats. So the list has it that you need 1,000 seats to move to Dedicated. And that's an attractive offering for like the bigger organizations. We're happy with the pipeline. There's been demand, and that demand is coming for the people currently on self-managed. And what they like about this offering, it has the same kind of security of self-managed and that they're the only customer. They're completely separated. They can set it up in their VPC, but they don't have the operational burden. We make sure they're on the latest version and that everything runs and where the experts at get lab and they don't no longer need those people internally dedicated to that.\nMatthew Hedberg: Got it. Thanks a lot guys.\nSharlene Seemungal: Now we will move to Ryan from Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for the question. For Sid, for those customers who are evaluating adding large language model features to their DevOps platform today, are they still mostly focused on co-digestions or is there increasingly other considerations at play as these customers get smarter and more in the weeds (ph) on AI?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. I think as customers get more sophisticated, they're seeing that AI should be throughout the life cycle. As mentioned earlier in this call, like it's DevSec and Ops, like you need those AI features to make security more efficient. If you just produce more color, that's not going to do it. And of those developers producing more code, that's not the only thing they need. So as customers get more sophisticated, they want more AI features, and we're really happy that we have 10 features out already. The second thing they want is good guarantees of privacy that their inter like property is never going to be used to enhance other people their platform, their intellectual property. So I think in both, we have a really compelling story.\nRyan MacWilliams: Excellent. And then one for Brian. Brian, I know billings and cRPO are not the perfect gauge of your business on a quarterly basis, just given the lumpiness in longer-term contracts. But anything to think about on those two metrics in the quarter just coming off a strong first quarter.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, Ryan. In 2Q, when large enterprise clients want to adopt the DevSecOps platform, they typically want to do multiyear deals. We talked about historically where we don't compensate for that because we didn't want to drive that behavior with such a high gross retention rate. But we did see a number of multiyear deals in I think it was said earlier, we had the largest deal in company history in 2Q. Once again, big multinational company, just a demonstration of wanting to go to a DevSecOps platform and making a long-term commitment to GitLab.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks, guys.\nSharlene Seemungal: And we'll move on to Mike from Needham.\nMichael Cikos: Hey. Thanks for getting me on here, guys. I had two questions, and I'll take them separately. But if I could first go to Brian I just wanted to make sure I'm kicking the tires here. I know you're talking in some of your comments to Matt that, hey, net bookings are slightly more positive. Churn is slightly below what you guys had forecast, which is great. But to be clear, like has there been any change as far as your assumption from this price increase to the guide? And can you remind us again, what is the benefit that you are including for this year's guidance when we think about the benefit from that price increase? And I just have one follow-up for Sid, sorry.\nBrian Robins: No, absolutely. Thanks, Mike. There's been -- it's included in our guidance. And when you walk through the ratable nature of the revenue, it's very little impact this year. So where we are doing better than expected on the way that we modeled it internally from a bookings and churn perspective. it doesn't have really any meaningful financial impact this year. We'll get the majority of the impact next year and then a little the following year.\nMichael Cikos: Got it. Thanks for that, Brian. And then for Sid, I just wanted to hash out. I know that we're all excited for the AI SKU launching later this year. A couple of questions here, but can you help us think about what's the expected timing? Is it more of a 3Q or 4Q event as well as I think when we've spoken about it today and last quarter as well, the main focus that we've heard externally is really around code suggestions. And I'm hoping, if you could elaborate a little bit more on maybe some of the additional features or functionality that will be added to that SKU as well or is there a potential actually to have multiple AI SKUs, almost like a good, better, best or separate AI SKUs that you are thinking about rolling out to the market. Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks for that. So it's projected to be generally available later this year. We haven't made a decision between Q3 or Q4 yet. [Technical Difficulty] It's likely will also end up coming with a different Q that includes more of the AI features although some of the AI features might be included in the existing alternate package, for example, suggested reviewers is already available to people without paying separately for it. So it's probably going to be a mix of those things.\nMichael Cikos: Perfect. Thank you.\nSharlene Seemungal: We now move to Jason at William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about the user limits on the free tier. Sid, I think you mentioned that -- or maybe Brian, you mentioned that. I'm not super familiar with what you did there. Could you just remind us what happened and what the impact has been and what it could be?\nBrian Robins: Sid, do you want that? Do you want me to take it?\nSid Sijbrandij: I'll start off, and you can add to my answer. But the user limits, they don't apply to self-managed installations. But for people on getlab.com using our free tier, we said, hey, if you have more than five users, you got to switch to a PT (ph). And the reason for that is we have significant costs kind of hosting gitlab.com. So we wanted to be long term sustainable. It is leading to good conversion, although, the majority of those conversions are below the $5,000 base customer cutoff. Brian, anything you want to add?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. The only thing I'll add on top of that, I think you covered most of it was that the free-to-pay conversion is also built into our guidance. And once again, with the ratable nature of revenue recognition, the impact this year will be minimal.\nJason Ader: Great. And then a quick follow-up. Just Brian, for you, on the large deal, largest in company history. Can you give us an idea of that size? And then also how big is your largest customer? How much sure they're spending annually on ARR just so we can kind of gauge what the opportunity would be with a lot of those 810, 100,000 (ph) customers 100,000-plus customers where they could potentially get to?\nBrian Robins: Yeah. So the largest deal that we signed this past quarter was over $30 million. It was a multiyear deal. And then we have several customers approaching $10 million a year.\nJason Ader: Helpful. Thanks.\nSharlene Seemungal: We now move to Pinjalim at JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask you on Ultimate as existing premium customers kind of look to pay the higher price, are you seeing some of the conversations lead to kind of upgrading to Ultimate, especially as you have to cape people and flow in some of the AI capabilities as well like suggested reviewers. Are those conversations from premium customers looking to upgrade starting to happen more.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Whatever we expect is baked into our guidance, but we're seeing that it is a reason for people to reevaluate which tier am I going to be on. And we're seeing ultimate being more and more top of mind for people. We haven't decided on the packaging of the AI features yet. So although AI is a significant part of the conversation, it's not driving Ultimate per se because we're still working on our packaging for the AI features.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. One for Brian. Brian, anything to call out on the DR side. It seems like the sequential build, I think, in Q2 was below that of Q1, which typically seems like does not happen, but wondering if there's anything to call out.\nBrian Robins: Nothing specific. I mean the Q2 total deferred revenue growth was 31% year-over-year. Our RPO growth was 37%, and our cRPO growth is about 34%. cRPO makes up approximately 68% of our total RPO. And so really pleased overall with the quarter.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. Thank you.\nSharlene Seemungal: Our final question comes from Allan from Wolfe Research.\nAllan Verkhovski: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. So following the appointment of Chris Weber, CRO, can you guys just talk about what he's been focused on. What’s he is looking to implement to help the company scale the next phase of growth? And how are you thinking about potential sales disruption for the year?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we're really excited to have Chris Weber on board. He's a very experienced sales executive. He's been responsible for multibillion-dollar sales organizations, and that's what we, as a company, want to go to hit the transition has been very seamless from our side. We spent a lot of time listening to our customers, listening to our sales team. There's no big changes in our go-to-market, so very smooth and setting us up for success in the future.\nAllan Verkhovski: Understood. And just one quick follow-up. I noticed that you guys on your release (ph) page had a target about 1 million code suggestions users. And now it looks like it's kind of generally growing your base of code suggestions, users as a goal. Can you guys just maybe talk about the change there and kind of the background, are you guys looking to push more on the R&D side behind it before launch? Any kind of incremental color would be helpful. Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: So we're an extremely transparent company that publishes our OKRs, our year lease, and we generally push people at GitLab to be extremely ambitious. For example, for our OKRs, we expect only 70% of our goals to be met. So especially in the beginning of OKR (ph) project, we set an ambitious goal. That's not something that was part of our investor communications or things like that. There's over -- there's a couple of thousand pages in the handbook. We appreciate people going through them, but they're not part of our official investor communication. I wouldn't add any weight to that. And this is a long game, and we're taking a long-term view of this.\nAllan Verkhovski: Thank you, Sid.\nSharlene Seemungal: That concludes our 2Q FY Q4 earnings presentation. Thanks again once more for joining us, and have a great day."

A replay of today's call will also be posted on ir.gitlab.com. I will now turn the call over to GitLab's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sid Sijbrandij.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you for joining us today. I want to start off by thanking so many of you for the well-wishes I've received regarding my health. I'm doing well and I remain committed as ever to GitLab success. I'm pleased with how our business performed in the first quarter of FY'24. We exceeded our own guidance for both revenue growth and non-GAAP profitability. We executed well towards our goal of making our customers successful on our AI-powered DevSecOps platform. This quarter we generated revenue of $126.9 million. This represents growth of 45% year-over-year. Our dollar based net retention rate was 128%. Our first quarter results continued to demonstrate improving operating leverage in our business. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by almost 1700 basis points year-over-year and we remain committed to growing in a responsible manner. I want to start this call with one of the most exciting technology developments of our time. AI and ML. AI represents a major shift for our industry. It fundamentally changes the way that software is developed, and we believe it will accelerate our ability to help organizations make software faster. I'm excited about this new wave of technology innovation, and we continue to focus on incorporating AI throughout our DevSecOps platform. We're innovating at a fast pace. In 1Q, we delivered five new AI features and in the first half of May alone, we delivered five additional features. All of these are available to customers now and we continue to iterate on Code Suggestions. This feature allows developers to write code more efficiently by receiving Code Suggestions as they type. Code Suggestions is available on gitlab.com for all users, while in beta, we expect Code Suggestions will be generally available later this year. One of the guiding principles with Code Suggestions is to make it available and accessible to all developers everywhere. We also extended language support, so that more developers can realize the benefits of AI on our platform. In 1Q, we increased language support from the initial six languages to now 13 languages. Code Suggestions is uniquely built with privacy first as a critical foundation. Our customers proprietary source code never leaves GitLab's cloud infrastructure. This means that their source code stays secure. In addition, model output is not stored and not used as training data. AI is not only changing how software is developed, it's also amplifying the value of having a DevSecOps platform. DevSecOps is a category that we created and we're seeing it enter a mainstream adoption phase. We are seeing industry analysts recognizing this. I'm pleased to share that GitLab was recently recognized as the only leader in the Forrester Wave for integrated software delivery platforms 2023. We are excited to see the market mature and recognize the value of an integrated software delivery platform, a strategy that GitLab has followed from the start. This quarter we had many conversations with senior level customers, but one with a CTO from a top five European bank really stands out. At first, we focused on many of our differentiated features that only a DevSecOps platform can provide. For example, we talked about the benefits of value stream dashboards, DORA metrics and compliance on a single platform. When the conversation moved into AI, the CTO said something extremely interesting. He said, cogeneration is only one aspect of the development cycle. If we only optimize cogeneration, everything else downstream from the development team, including QA security and operations breaks, breaks because these other teams involved in software development can't keep up. This point, incorporating AI throughout the software development life cycle is at the core of our AI strategy. Today, our customers have the ability to use Code Suggestions for co-creation, suggested reviewers for code review. Explain this vulnerability for vulnerability remediation, value stream forecasting for predicting future team efficiency and much more. We're proud to have ten AI features available to customers today, almost three times more than the competition. Applying AI to a single data store for the full software development lifecycle also creates compelling business outcomes. We believe that this is something that can only be done with GitLab. We see a lot of excitement surrounding AI at the executive level. We are hearing from customers that AI is motivating them to assess how they develop, secure and operate software through a new lens. Enterprise level companies who may not have been in a market until 2024, 2025, 2026 are re-evaluating their strategies. On top of that, there's new personas entering the mix. As chief information security officers navigate these new AI powered world, they are working to empower their teams to benefit from AI and apply appropriate governance, security compliance and auditability. In all, we believe that AI will increase the total addressable market for several reasons. First, AI will make writing code easier, which we believe will expand the audience of people such as junior and citizen developers who build software. Second, as these developers become more productive, we see software becoming less expensive to create. We believe this will fuel demand for even more software. More developers will be needed to meet this additional demand. And third, we expect customers will increasingly turn to GitLab as they build machine learning models and AI into their applications. As we add ModelOps capabilities to our DevSecOps platform, this will invite data science teams as new personas and will allow these teams to work alongside their DevSecOps counterparts. We see ModelOps as a big opportunity for GitLab. Expanding the addressable market will also create an opportunity to capture greater value. Later this year, we plan to introduce an AI add-on focused on supporting development teams. This new add-on will include Code Suggestions functionality. We anticipate this will be priced at $9 per user per month billed annually. This add-on will be available later this year across all our tiers. All of this innovation accentuates a broader theme for our business. The differentiation between a Dev and a DevSecOps platform. We believe that an AI-powered platform focused solely on the developer persona is incomplete. It is missing essential security operations and enterprise functionality. Remember, developers spend only a small fraction of their time developing code. The real promise of AI extends far beyond code creation. And this is where GitLab has a structural advantage. We are the most comprehensive DevSecOps platform in the market. Features like Code Suggestions and Remote Development are important accelerants for developer efficiency. And today, GitLab has more AI features geared towards developers than our competitors. However, that isn't enough. In order to achieve a ten times faster cycle time on projects, enterprises need an end-to-end platform that works across the entire software development life cycle. Let me describe some of GitLab's key security operations and enterprise differentiators. For security only GitLab has dynamic application security testing, container scanning, API, security, compliance management and security policy management. In operations, only GitLab has feature flags, infrastructure as code, error tracking, service desk and incident management. And for enterprises only GitLab has portfolio management, OKR management, value stream Management, DORA metrics and design management. Let me illustrate the value of a DevSecOps platform with one of our customers, Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin's customers depend on them to help them overcome their most complex challenges and to stay ahead of emerging threats. Their customers need the most technologically advanced solutions. Lockheed Martin's engineering teams require speed and flexibility to meet the specific mission needs of each customers. They also require shared expertise and infrastructure to ensure affordability. Lockheed Martin has a history of using a wide variety of DevOps tools and needed to improve automation, standardize security practices and collaboration. They choose to go big with GitLab, greatly reducing their tool chain and cutting complexity while reducing costs and workload. Lockheed Martin team has reported eighty times faster CI Pipeline builds 90% less time spent on system maintenance. They've retired thousands of Jenkins servers. Lockheed Martin continues to grow with GitLab and is looking to migrate even more projects to their DevSecOps platform. One of their software strategy executives said by switching to GitLab and automating deployment teams have moved from monthly or weekly deliveries to daily or multiple daily deliveries. Lockheed is a great example of the power of a DevSecOps platform and we see this in other use cases as well, such as compliance. In the quarter, a large health care provider purchased GitLab Ultimate for a platform features. They needed to meet specific compliance requirements from their auditors. They determined that GitLab is the best way to achieve their objectives. Another customer we expanded business with in Q1 is NatWest Group, a relationship bank for the digital world. NatWest Group is focused on delivering sustainable growth and results of fostering a better, simpler banking experience. Last year, NatWest Group chose GitLab dedicated. He wanted to enable their engineers to use a common cloud engineering platform to deliver a better experience for customers and colleagues. Five months into the program, we are pleased that NatWest has reported shorter onboarding times and productivity gains. This led to NatWest choosing GitLab professional services to accelerate their transformation by supporting training certifications and developer days. In summary, we're confident in a strong value proposition that GitLab provides to customers. GitLab is the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps enterprise platform. The significant return on investment, quick payback period and well-documented positive business outcomes are resonating globally. We're trusted by more than 50% of the Fortune 100 to secure and protect their most valuable assets. We also believe we're in the early stages of capturing an estimated $40 billion addressable market, a market that we've seen evolve from point solutions to a platform from DIY DevOps to a DevSecOps platform. And AI will speed up different aspects of software creation and development. This in turn creates the need for a more robust security compliance and planning capabilities. In today's era of rapid innovation, the power of a platform like GitLab to enable faster cycle times truly shines. I'll now turn it over to Brian Robins, GitLab's Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian Robins: Thank you, Sid, and thank you again for everyone joining us today. I'd like to spend a moment discussing the macro environment, the financial impact of our recently implemented premium pricing change and provide some insights into the financial impact of our AI products. Then I will quickly recap our first quarter financial results and key operating metrics and conclude with our guidance. Let me first touch on some of the watch points I discussed on prior calls. We continue to see sales cycles remaining at 4Q levels due to more people involved in deal approvals. Contraction improved over 4Q, but is higher than prior quarters. Like 4Q, contraction is driven almost entirely by lower seat counts with minimal down tearing. I was pleased with the bookings predictability in 1Q. It was much better than 4Q. As we mentioned on the prior call, we raised the price of our premium skew for the first time in five years. Over that time frame, we added over 400 new features, transitioned from a Dev platform to a DevSecOps platform. We shared that we expected the premium price increase of minimum impact in FY'24 with greater impact in FY'25 and beyond. The price increase which took effect on April 3rd is going as planned. We only had one month of renewals impacted by the price increase in the quarter. To-date, customer churn is unchanged for the premium customers who renewed in April and our average ARR per customer increased in line with our expectations. Now on to the way we are thinking about the financials and the impact of our AI products. We continue to invest in people and infrastructure to support AI. While we have had some teams working on AI features, we recently shifted additional engineers from other teams to support the work on AI. As a result, this has not led to significant incremental expenses on engineering talent. Additionally, we have made investments in our cloud provider spend to support our AI and R&D efforts. In addition, we also continue to leverage partners help drive our AI vision. This has included partnership announcements with Google Cloud and Oracle. The Google Partnership allows us to use Google Cloud AI functionality to make our own AI offerings better by leveraging their toolset. The partnership with Oracle makes it easier for our customers to deploy their own AI and machine learning workloads using Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Both of these partnerships help create strategic differentiation for our customers in a financially responsible manner. Now turning to the quarter. Revenue of 126.9 million this quarter represents an increase of 45% organically from the prior year. We ended 1Q with over 7400 customers with ARR of at least $5,000 compared to over 7000 customers in the fourth quarter of FY'23 and over 5100 customers in the prior year. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 43%. Currently, customers with greater than 5000 ARR represent approximately 95% of our total ARR. We also measure the performance and growth of our larger customers who we define as those spending more than 100,000 in ARR with us. At the end of the first quarter of FY'24, we had 760 customers with ARR of at least $100,000 compared to 697 customers in 4Q of FY'23 and 545 customers in the first quarter of FY'23. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 39%. As many of you know, we do not believe calculated billings to be a good indicator of our business. Given that prior period, comparisons can be impacted by a number of factors, most notably our history of large prepaid multiyear deals. This quarter, total RPO grew 37% year-over-year to 460 million and cRPO grew 44% to 324 million for the same time frame. We ended our first quarter with a dollar based net retention rate of 128%. As a reminder, this is a trailing 12 month metric that compares expansion activity of customers over the last 12 months with the same cohort of customers during the prior 12 month period. The dollar based net retention of 128% was driven by lower seat expansion and contraction due to seats. The ultimate tier continues to be our fastest growing tier, representing 42% of ARR for the first quarter of FY'24, compared with 39% of ARR in the first quarter of FY'23. Non-GAAP gross margins were 91% for the quarter, which is slightly improved from both the immediate preceding quarter for the first quarter of FY'23. SaaS represents over 25% of total ARR, and we've been able to maintain non-GAAP gross margins despite the higher cost of delivery. This is another example of how we continue to drive efficiencies in the business. We saw improved operating leverage this quarter, largely driven by realizing greater efficiencies as we continue to scale the business. Non-GAAP operating loss of 15 million or negative 12% of revenue compared to a loss of 24.8 million or negative 28% of revenue in 1Q of last year. 1Q FY'24 includes 5.6 million of expenses related to our JV and majority owned subsidiary compared to 3.7 million in 1Q FY'23. Operating cash use was 11 million in the first quarter of FY'24 compared to 28.2 million use in the same quarter of last year. Now let's turn to guidance. We are assuming the macroeconomic headwinds and trends in the business we have seen over the last few quarters continue. There has been no change to our overall guidance philosophy. For the second quarter of FY'24, we expect total revenue of 129 million to 130 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 29% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating loss of 11 million to 10 million and we expect a non-GAAP net loss per share of negative $0.03 to negative $0.02, assuming a 153 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year FY'24, we now expect total revenue of 541 million to 543 million, representing a growth rate of approximately 28% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating loss of 47 million to 43 million and we expect non-GAAP net loss per share of negative $0.18 to negative $0.14 assuming a 153 million weighted average shares outstanding. On a percentage basis, our new annual FY'24 guidance implies a non-GAAP operating improvement of approximately 1200 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint of our guidance. Over a longer term, we believe that a continued targeted focus on growth initiatives and scaling the business will yield further improvements in unit economics. The guidance has us on track to achieve cash flow breakeven for FY'25. For modeling purposes, we estimate that our fully diluted share count is 173 million. Separately, I would like to provide an update on JiHu, our China joint venture. Our goal remains to deconsolidate JiHu. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or timing of when this may potentially occur. Thus, for modeling purposes for FY'24, we now forecast approximately 29 million of expenses related to JiHu compared with 19 million in FY'23. These JiHu expenses represent approximately negative 5% of our total implied negative 8% non-GAAP operating loss for FY'24. Our number one priority as a management team is to drive revenue growth, but we'll do that responsibly. There has been no philosophical change in how we run the business to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. Before we take questions, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting GitLab to help them achieve their business objectives. Also want to thank our team members, partners and the wider GitLab community for their contributions this quarter. With that, we'll now move to Q&A. To ask a question, please use the chat feature and post your question directly to IR questions. We're ready for the first question.\nOperator:\nA - Darci Tadich: Our first question comes from Rob with Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: All right. I think I did that correctly after three years of using Zoom. Good afternoon, guys.\nSid Sijbrandij: Hey, Rob. Good afternoon.\nRob Owens: Curious to hear an update on customer conversations. Obviously a stronger than expected quarter, but we are seeing this deceleration, I think, across all high-growth tech companies. So both Gen AI -- in the macro, how should we think about pressure on net retention rates, customer acquisition that's coming from customers taking a more prudent approach in the current budgetary environment versus, I guess, rethinking needs for Dev headcount and re-evaluating which Dev tools to purchase just given all the Gen AI innovations lately?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks, Rob. And before I answer that question, maybe an update on my health. I just completed my last round of systemic chemotherapy. So happy about that.\nRob Owens: Congratulations.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks. And also no sign of detectable disease, and I'm excited about GitLab's future and continuing my role as CEO and Chair. Yes, lots of things to unpack in your question. We see the macro trends continuing, and that's putting pressure on seat count. That was the same last quarter, and we anticipate that trend to continue. At the same time, we're super excited of what the macro is doing to the mindset of customers, because they say, hey, now we -- it's time to consolidate. And at the same time, we see that the analysts are seeing that, hey, this is consolidating as a market. So we believe that DevOps platform is going to be the way that people will consolidate. And we have the most comprehensive DevSecOps platform, which is also great if you look at the application of AI. We're able to apply AI not just for Code Suggestions, but apply it across the entire spectrum. We have more than 10 features that we were able to ship. And those 10 features, they drive value at every part along the stage. And as for how that influences the TAM, which you alluded to, we think AI is going to make it easier for more people to enter the fray. So we think it was a supply of more people using the product. At the same time, when you see that software development becomes easier, we believe there's going to be more demand for it. Software development used to be very expensive. AI makes it more affordable. There's going to be more demand. And more demand, again, means more people entering the fray. And last but certainly not least, it's an opportunity for us to manage not just the code that companies have, but also their models. And that's what we do with our MLOps functionality. We already allow you to run experiments with GitLab. We want to extend to a full MLOps managed platform where we add the data engineers to the constituents that use GitLab.\nRob Owens: Great. And if I can sneak a quick one in for Brian. Just regarding DBOs in the linearity of the quarter, was that either large deals at the end? Or was it very back-end weighted? And if I look at that receivable base and assume collections on it, looks like you could turn the corner from a cash flow perspective relatively soon. So any commentary on turning free cash flow positive? Thanks.\nBrian Robins: Yeah, I'll touch on DSOs, and I'll touch on free cash flow breakeven. And so from a DSO perspective, we were more weighted towards the end of the quarter. But the good news is that we -- our amount of bad debt over the last three years has not exceeded 1%, and our age receivables has been very, very consistent. And so some of our European customers have requested Net 45, Net 60. And so we've accommodated that just because of the macro and the bad debt expense being so low. From a free cash flow breakeven perspective, we committed to be free cash flow breakeven in FY 2025. And we've also stated some of the actions that we've taken previously will accelerate our path to profitability, but haven't given a specific time line on that.\nRob Owens: All right. Thanks, guys.\nBrian Robins: Thanks, Rob. Darci, you're muted.\nDarci Tadich: Up next, we have Joel with Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you. And Sid, I'm sending prayers to you, and congrats on making it through the treatment.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thank you.\nJoel Fishbein: Brian, just a quick follow-up for you on Rob's question. Congrats on the margin improvement. I think that's -- you've done a really good job. Can you give us a little bit more color on some of the things that you're doing to continue to drive towards cash flow breakeven while still investing in some of these new initiatives that you're doing, which obviously you've spent a lot of time talking about some of these AI programs that are coming out. And then just as a follow-up to that, have you like tested this $9 increased -- license increase to your customer base and whether or not that they'll -- there's going to be any pushback there? Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Yes, Joel, absolutely. Thanks for the question. As Sid and I have always stated since we went public is the number one objective at GitLab is to grow, but we'll do that responsibly. And we've tried to demonstrate that every quarter. And so nothing has changed in that front. Our non-GAAP gross margin percent went up to 91%, even though we continue to have really high SaaS growth and SaaS is greater than 25% of our overall revenue. And so we're continuing to look at all areas within the business where we can optimize, but we aren't doing that at the expense of growth because that's the number one objective at the company. I think we demonstrated that across all cost categories and we'll continue to look at that quarter-over-quarter. On the $9 increase, we haven't tested that yet. From a guidance perspective, most of the cost for that is in headcount and cloud costs, and that's included in the guidance that we gave. And so we don't expect any changes from a guidance perspective.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you.\nDarci Tadich: Next, we have Sterling with MoffettNathanson.\nSterling Auty: Thanks. Hi, guys. Sid, congratulations as well on the completion of the treatments. Hopefully, you got a chance to actually ring the bell. Brian just -- and Sid just another follow-up question just on the pricing. So you touched upon it, but I want to make sure to put a fine point here. Did it have any impact on win rates or length of deals where maybe customers were asking and negotiating a little bit harder because of the price increase? Or anything in terms of size of initial lands that may have been impacted because of the price increase? And if not, does that actually change when you think some of the benefits of the pricing increase will actually flow through the revenue line?\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks, Sterling. I guess for everyone on the call, let me just briefly touch on the price increase. We haven't raised prices in five years. And over that time period, we added 400 new features to the platform. And so that was the genesis of the price increase. The guidance we gave last quarter and today include the price increase. As you know, the price was effective in early April. And so we really only had a short period of less than a month for that. But I am happy to say that the renewal rates and the churn and the land of new customers have been better than expected. And so we're happy with the results that we've seen in just that one month time period.\nSterling Auty: All right. Great. Thank you.\nDarci Tadich: Our next question comes from Matt with RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg: Hey, guys. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and I'll offer my congrats, Sid. That's the best news of the call, really good to hear you doing well. I noticed Ultimate ticked up. I believe, Brian, you said it was 42%, which, last year, was kind of flattish, really the whole year. I was curious what was driving that? Is that sort of AI showing up some of those migrations? Is it more of the not security? Or perhaps is it -- is there any of the price increase on premium that's maybe driving folks to Ultimate?\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks, Matt. When we talk about Ultimate, as we said before, is we don't set the sales compensation to basically compensate on Ultimate versus Premium. We want to try to take as much friction out of the process. For the consumer as well, we do the same on SaaS and self-managed as well. And so Ultimate, the strength in Ultimate is really based on the underlying value that we're driving to our customers. The ROI on Ultimate, Forrester did a study, it was 427% over three years, and payback was around six months. And so when I looked at the quarter and looked at sort of Premium, Ultimate and sort of the breakout between contraction, churn, first order and expansion, Ultimate had -- churn was consistent with a bunch of prior quarters. Contraction was very consistent. Our growth was just as good as prior quarters, and we had a really strong first order quarter as well. And so Ultimate continues to do well. It's our fastest-growing tier, and we're happy with the results.\nMatthew Hedberg: That's fantastic. And then maybe just if I could follow up with one with Sid. One of the questions that we get from developer -- from investors the most is, does Gen AI put pressure on Dev, developer seat count. I think you talked about a little bit in your prepared remarks, but maybe could you put a finer point on sort of the question of P times Q. And does the number of seats go down in the future? Or do you think it stays consistent or maybe even goes up?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. We believe that generative AI will expand the market. So first of all, you make the product easier. Like coding today is hard, and AI makes it easier. So we expect the citizen developers, these junior developers to start coding. That code needs to be managed somewhere. And that is in GitLab. The second thing is you make it -- you -- when a developer can do more, you bring down the price, and that should increase demand for development and software development activities. Third, what you have is today is a DevSecOps platform, but we've already articulated that we want to be a place where you manage not just code, but also MLOps. MLOps is the management of data and the management of models. Models are harder to manage than code. They change over time, and they have a lot of risks, security risks, discrimination risks, risks that you're doing the wrong thing, risk that they are outdated. So it's a really interesting space to expand the product to. And for example, today, if you have an experiment in MLFlow, you can link it to the experiment in GitLab. And in the future, we'll plan to come out with a model registry in GitLab. So those are all reasons why we think the market will expand. One other way to look at it is you have generative AI. It produces more code. All that codes also needs to be secured, also need to put in operations. So if you don't have a good DevSecOps platform, you create a bottleneck at the beginning. That bottleneck is solved with the DevSecOps platform.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thank you\nDarci Tadich: We will now hear from Koji with Bank of America.\nKoji Ikeda: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a question for Sid or Brian here. I wanted to ask you a question about how you plan on attacking the other 50% of the Fortune 500 or I'm sorry, the Fortune 100 that you don't have. Is it still a primary land-and-expand strategy? Or is it going to be more of a higher level sale for these customers? I was just kind of hoping you could dig into that a little bit more, please.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. I think it's certainly that it is both the bottoms-up sale but also the top-down sales. So we have a direct sales motion, but also a channel sales motion that's getting more important. Channel sales, think of our partners, AWS and GCP, where we work with them to go to customers. And we're talking to CTOs, CSOs, CIOs, and we help them see the picture. What we commonly do as a value stream analysis. We point out all the different tools they use throughout the cycle and how that adds up in cycle time. And with GitLab, they're going to save on tooling costs, they can save on the cost of integrating that tooling. They can make their people more productive, and they can go faster through that cycle and get initiatives out. So it's certainly something we're going to market with. And as you said, our goal is 100% of the Fortune 100.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it. And maybe a follow-up here for Brian on kind of going back to free cash flow. This quarter, free cash flow is higher than non-GAAP operating income. And I recall there's some cash flow mechanics around contract duration that should be mostly be out of the model by this point. So is that right with the cash flow mechanics? And does free cash flow trend higher than non-GAAP operating income from here on an annual basis? Just could you just dig into that just a little bit more for me, please?\nBrian Robins: Yes, absolutely. When we joined -- when I first joined the company, we were not incentivizing the sales force to do multiyear deals because we had such a high gross retention rate. And so we really pushed for one year deals in this. That's why you saw billings and RPO is -- go down and wouldn't grow at the same rate as cRPO or short-term calculated billings. But we still continue to have prepaid multiyear deals within our existing book of business. And so as those contracts renew, you'll see some lumpiness in our billings and collections, and Q1 was one of those quarters.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it. Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Thank you.\nDarci Tadich: Next, we have Michael with KeyBank.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys.\nBrian Robins: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Turits: Can you hear me? Sorry about that.\nBrian Robins: We can. Go ahead.\nMichael Turits: So can you talk again you know Brian you said about how competition has gone. Microsoft, obviously, they have been very visible around Copilot. You announced a lot of features. But how has the sort of day in and day out competition gone. As you said, Brian, sales cycles have not extended, but are people sizing you up against each other and differently. How are they entering this discussion about whether or not [Technical Difficulty]\nBrian Robins: Yes. I think I got most of it, Michael. And I think I'll repeat the question was how has the sales cycle changed with between us and Microsoft, and what -- if you had noticed any change -- noticeable things within the quarter. So one thing to note this quarter is on last earnings call, I talked about how the first month of the quarter was very different than the second and third month of the quarter. This quarter is really predictable. And so I was happy with the predictability of the quarter. Week Three, we called the quarter and landed really close to that. The sales cycles in first quarter remained at fourth quarter levels. And so there wasn't a lot of change there. As I talked about earlier, Ultimate being greater than 50% of the bookings and continue to do well. I think that shows some of the differentiation between us and Microsoft. The hyperscalers as well had a great quarter as well. They grew over 200% year-over-year from a bookings perspective. And also this quarter, we had lower discounting than the previous quarter. And so the trends with Microsoft remain pretty consistent where we still don't see any competition at about 50% of the deals. We see them in very little deals, but there is more discussion around OpenAI, ChatGPT and Copilot. All right. Darci, we'll go into the next one.\nDarci Tadich: Derrick with Cowen is next.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. And Sid congrats on the news. I wanted to start, in the press release, you talked about an expanded partnership with Oracle and a new AI/ML offering, enabling customers to speed up model train and inference. Can you give us a little more detail around those new partner initiatives? And then just from a broader perspective, how you're thinking about the Gen AI related revenue opportunities in the quarters ahead?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes, thanks for the question. So we're really excited about our partnership with Oracle Cloud. They have a great customer base. And what it means is that our customers now can now run AI and ML workloads on DPU-enabled GitLab runners on the Oracle Cloud infrastructure, and that's a great powerful infrastructure. Additionally, we're available in Oracle's marketplace, expanding our distribution. So our strategy, with AI in mind, is to partner closer with the hyperscalers. And the toughest one is Microsoft. We try to partner there too, but with everyone else, we see a lot of momentum, and that's AWS, GCP and Oracle. We want to get closer. We want to enable our customers to run their normal workloads, their AI workloads there, and where you can expect us to have more announcements going forward.\nDerrick Wood: Okay. Maybe a quick one for you, Brian. Appreciate getting more exact numbers on net revenue retention rates. Kind of looking forward and with respect to your guidance for the rest of the year, is there any kind of target ranges that you'd guide us towards? Or how we should be thinking about trends around gross retention and expansion factors?\nBrian Robins: We didn't give out the specifics of those metrics. What I will say is this quarter -- last quarter was more predictable. And so it makes it easier from a modeling perspective. And everything is factored into guidance. And so we didn't give specific metrics for those.\nDerrick Wood: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nDarci Tadich: Kash with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sid good to see that you're recovering very well and congratulations on the quarter. It looks like business stabilized for you guys. I had a question on the generative AI capabilities. At what point are we looking to -- is there any need for further differentiation of GitLab versus the competition? This auto code generation feature that has been made much off, right? Is that a real sticking point in conversations? Do you think the customer base really values and appreciates the broader set of AI capabilities that GitLab has to offer? So it looks like there is a bit of a perception issue in the market that you don't have those kinds of features that the competition appears to have. If you can debunk that mix for us, that will be great. And then one for you, Brian, what does the month of May look like from a linearity standpoint? The net expansion rates that you saw as improving in the March quarter, it does hold up in the month of May as well. Thank you so much.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Kash. Like in AI, you have the code generation. If you just produce a whole bunch more code, then it's going to get log jammed later down the pipeline. You also need to do more security fixes. You need to deploy more. So we're really fortunate that we have a single application, a single data store for the entire DevSecOps cycle, and we can apply to AI to all of them. And that's led us to having three times as many publicly usable AI features as our competition. That is a big advantage. As long as at the beginning that, of course, you also need the code suggestions. But having the whole rest make sure that if you get more effective there, it works, and you get a faster cycle time throughout and that's a really exciting development.\nKash Rangan: And Brian I had one for you. Yeah, thank you.\nBrian Robins: And just on the second part of the question, as you would expect, we track a number of metrics internally from top of the pipeline to bottom conversion rates, piecing, expansion, churn, contraction and so forth. And I'm happy quarter-to-date, things are as expected. And so like I've mentioned last quarter, it was more predictable in fourth quarter and quarter-to-date and we'll see how the quarter finishes out, but it's as expected on all those metrics that we track internally.\nKash Rangan: Great. Good to see the quarter and the results. Thank you so much.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Kash.\nDarci Tadich: Next is Karl with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Maybe, Brian, I'll point this to you. So as all of us try to run back of the envelope math about what the $9 per seat monetization plan might mean for fiscal '25, can you offer any guardrails as to things we should keep in mind so we're -- maybe we're a little bit tight on what it could mean. And I guess maybe as two quick follow-ups. Is there any reason to believe that it wouldn't be applicable to all of your paying users? Or does it feel like it would be relevant only for a subset? And then on top of that, do you think this could actually accelerate the conversion of the free user base to the paid user base such that the opportunity set is beyond our estimate of what you're paying user base looks like? Thank you.\nBrian Robins: Lots in there to unpack. Just on FY 2025, we haven't given out guidance for next year yet. And so I really can't comment on that. The $9 that Sid talked about in the script is baked into our guidance for this year.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. But Brian does it -- could it accelerate a free-to-paid conversion? I'm not asking you for fiscal '25 guidance, just kind of framework as we try to model out what it could mean. Anything you'd offer up as we take our best shot?\nBrian Robins: I think that all that we're doing is to make the developer, the security and operations persona is more efficient and to allow and make better, faster, cheaper, more secure. And so I think anything that you do that enables that should help out on all the metrics that you track and model.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Congrats on the quarter.\nBrian Robins: Appreciate it, Karl.\nDarci Tadich: We will now hear from Jason with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay?\nBrian Robins: We can.\nJason Ader: All right. Great. I wanted to ask about whether you're exploring a consumption element to your pricing model and how that might work, especially on the cloud side.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes, thanks for that. We already have consumptives elements in our model. So for example, for compute and for storage, you pay on a consumption basis. We're adding features to that consumption, for example, in GitLab 16 released on June 22nd, we released MacOS runners, we released Linux runners, we had the Oracle partnership where we have more AI runners, DPU runners. So that is a small part of our revenue today, but we're releasing additional features. I think over time, you see that the licensing is going to become more flexible. We have cloud licensing today and that allows us to be more flexible in what you pay for. For example, the add-on we are envisioning for AI, right now, it's efficient to something if you use it, you pay for it, otherwise not. We'll see what we end up releasing, but that's what we're thinking about. So I think you're right that the mindset of customers is going more consumption, and we don't -- we want to be meeting the expectations there.\nJason Ader: Got you. All right. And then one quick follow-up just on that AI SKU. What is going to be included in that SKU beyond Code Suggestions?\nSid Sijbrandij: Right now, we've only talked about Code Suggestions being part of it.\nJason Ader: Perfect. Thank you. Good to see you looking good, Sid.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks, Jason. Appreciate it.\nDarci Tadich: Gregg with Mizuho.\nBrian Robins: We don't see him. We can go to the next one.\nDarci Tadich: Pinjalim with JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Sid, good to see you doing well. Sid, maybe one on MLOps. Can you help us understand where are we in the maturity curve for GitLab with respect to MLOps. Is DataOps kind of the gap at this point? I'm trying to understand with the current craze of kind of developing Gen AI application, are you seeing new or existing customers kind of talking about using GitLab as part of their MLOps workflow when they're thinking about building this Gen AI apps? And then one follow-up. The $9 per user per month add-on is that basically an extension into visual code? Is there a difference between a SaaS user or a self-managed user?\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes. Thanks for that. So to answer the last question first, that $9 will be the same $9, whether you're a SaaS user or a self-managed user. You'll be able to use the Code Suggestion features in our Web IDE as well as in the usual editors like Visual Studio Code. Regarding ModelOps, we're really, really early. So I don't want to oversell this. It's a vision of where we're going to the future, of where we see the TAM expanding. Today, we have the functionality to link experiments in MLFlow to GitLab, and the next feature that will come out is a model registry. And when you have a model registry, that's going to form the basis of new functionality we can do is then you have the model kind of control in GitLab as well, and you can start adding more functionality. We expect that MLOps functionality to come before the DataOps functionality. The model learning looks a lot more like code in many ways than the data. So it's kind of the logical step is first models and then data. With data, it's -- we don't have functionality yet and that will come later. I think it's -- the thing to know is that we have the ambition. We have the ambition to go beyond code. We have the ambition to manage your code, your models and your data because we think the application of the future is going to have all three, and all three are going to be governed. All three are going to have security and compliance questions that you want your tool, your DevSecOps platform to figure out for you. And that's why we are doing this, not because it's easy, but because it's super, super useful, and because every application is going to have interactions between the three, if we can bring all those constituents together, that's going to be super valuable for our customers.\nPinjalim Bora: Very helpful. Thank you\nDarci Tadich: Next is Mike with Needham.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. You have Mike Cikos on the line here and thank for taking the question. First one for Sid, and Sid, great to hear on the health. That's tremendous news, and I appreciate you giving us all an update. Wanted to circle up on the AI add-on that we've been talking about. And I know the Code Suggestions is the only one that we're talking to today that's going to be part of that add-on. Can you help us think through, will GitLab be offering up AI features or certain products, however you want to phrase it, independent of that add-on? Or are you going to have to adopt that AI add-on be able to reap the benefits of the AI technology investments that you guys are making today? And then I have one follow-up for Brian.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes, it's a great question. Like will every AI, piece of AI functionality be in that add-on? And how does it work? Will there be additional add-ons? Will it be part of Premium or Ultimate? Those are pricing and packaging questions. We're still looking into today so I can't comment on that. It's a valid question though.\nMike Cikos: Okay. And to Brian then, if I just look at Q1, obviously, the revenue was well ahead of the guidance and your expectations. Can you help us think through what was better than expected during the quarter? And similarly, what is management embedding in its guidance, if I look at the much more, I guess, modest sequential revenue growth that we're now looking for in 2Q?\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. I was happy with the predictability in the quarter, as I states earlier. When we talked about guidance on the last call, because we had more variability in fourth quarter, the range got higher. And so we looked at the bottom end of the range and selected that. And so if you compare us 1Q to 4Q, sales cycles remained at 4Q levels. I did discuss how the hyperscalers bookings were over 200% year-over-year. We also had the lower discounting, and I touched on the strength of Ultimate in the quarter. And so the guidance approach hasn't changed. When we look at the history of what we've done and we look at the assumptions that we have in the model, we have a very detailed bottoms-up model to come up with guidance. And we use the same guidance approach given the macro conditions, and that's how we planned.\nMike Cikos: I'll leave it there. Thank you guys.\nBrian Robins: Appreciate it.\nDarci Tadich: Let's try Gregg with Mizuho. He has reconnected.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you very much. Glad the connection is holding. And Sid very glad to hear the encouraging news regarding your health. I'd like to follow up on ModelOps, and I know it's really early. I do think the native registry is an interesting enhancement. And just curious to get your expectation with regard to attracting data science teams to the platform going forward as that starts to ramp? And then I have a follow-up for Brian.\nSid Sijbrandij: Yes, because it's really early, we want them to work together hand in hand. You see that many changes need both the change in the code and a change in the models and it's going to lead to different data being outputted. So these changes that today happen in different platform, different tool chains and sometimes very manual. We expect that it's going to be more and more important to happen on the same level. You think about the financial industry, what you execute, what you have to prove to your auditors is going to be based on procedural code plus a model you're running, plus that model you're changing based on data that you need to prove like what data did you use to train the model that, that was then called from your code, that's the questions we need to answer, that our customers need to answer, and we want to help them do that in a way that's friction-free where it's not up to the developers to document it each and every time but the platform just takes care of it and you only have to point out a transaction and you can immediately see how you did that. And that's really hard to achieve today without a platform. And that's what we're going for. As I said very, very early, but I hope a compelling ambition.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Very helpful. And then for Brian, in the Q4, you mentioned that your NRR decreased almost equally, I think, across seats, tier upgrades and price yield. Any change to that mix in the Q1?\nBrian Robins: It's been relatively the same. And so seats is about 50%. Price increase is about 25%, and the last is 25%. So there really hasn't been any change whatsoever.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Perfect. Thank you.\nDarci Tadich: Next is Nick with Scotiabank.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys for taking the questions and Sid great to hear you're doing well. Just a follow-up on Matt's question on the Ultimate mix ticking up. It sounds like some of the strength there was driven from a business that was up for renewal in a smaller price point delta between Premium, Ultimate, and it also sounds like there was some strength there just on net new customers landing at Ultimate. But I'm just curious given there's more renewal businesses as sort of we progressed through 2Q in the second half, should we expect the Ultimate mix to continue to uptick here? Thanks.\nBrian Robins: Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. As we said before, and I think it's worth saying again, we don't compensate the sales team to sell Ultimate versus Premium. And so that is an output and not something that we're solving for. We want to deliver the best solution for the customer and get them a quick time to value and a positive business outcome. And so Ultimate had strength in the quarter. It's really driven by compliance, security and all the additional product features that Ultimate has. When you go through and look at Ultimate and look at expansion, first orders and so forth, Ultimate performed well in a lot of the categories as expected. And so where we saw some pockets of weakness was really in Premium on expansion of our existing clients as well as the contraction. Churn was relatively low, but we still saw some contraction as well. And so like I said, Ultimate had a good quarter. There was some pockets of weakness in premium, I'll call them watch points that we continue to watch. But overall, happy with what we delivered.\nNick Altmann: Great. Thank you.\nDarci Tadich: Our final question comes from Ryan with Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for squeezing me in. Sid, how are enterprises evaluating adopting AI for their code development today? So like what are some of the key items that they would grade you on? And would this happen via something like an RFP process? Or would this be something that they handle internally? Thanks.\nSid Sijbrandij: Thanks. I believe it's more organic today. They're trying different things. I think what is really important to a lot of customers is the privacy of their code. And what they're looking for is a provider who can guarantee that, for example, the output of the models that they ask questions to isn't used for other models. So that's something that's top of mind for us as we build our features. Other than that, it also has to be kind of accessible to everyone in the company. It has to work on the most popular editors. And we have a lot of revenue from self-managed. So we want to make sure that, over time, functionality also is available to self-manage customers where they can connect to the Internet to offer that functionality.\nRyan MacWilliams: So are you seeing a lot of questions from customers around securing the output of code from large language models?\nSid Sijbrandij: I think it's top of mind for customers is that the -- with some of the third-party services today, you don't get a guarantee that the output isn't used to train the Code Suggestions for another organization. And that's certainly top of mind for them.\nRyan MacWilliams: Appreciate that. And one for Brian. Do you see any pull forward of demand or early contract negotiations from customers looking to take advantage of that $24 transition price in the quarter?\nBrian Robins: I'll answer this, but this is the last one, Ryan. We got to close out and get back on the call backs. We did not allow early renewals. Your contract had to be up renewal two weeks prior to expiration. And so there was no pull forward in the quarter related to that.\nRyan MacWilliams: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nDarci Tadich: That concludes our 1Q FY'24 earnings presentation. Thanks again, once more, for joining us. Have a great day."
