All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO; and Willem Maintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Earlier today, we announced our accelerated infrastructure for the AI ERA Investor event, which will be held in New York on April 11. Please refer to our press release for more details. We look forward to updating investors on the exciting opportunities we see in front of us from the growth in accelerated infrastructure. Let me now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the quarter. Matt?\nMatt Murphy : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell delivered revenue of $1.43 billion, growing 1% sequentially above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, on a non-GAAP basis, the Marvell team drove a substantial 330 basis point sequential increase in gross margin, completed execution on the OpEx reduction plan we outlined earlier in the year and delivered earnings per share of $0.46, growing 12% sequentially. As Willem will tell you in greater detail, we also drove another strong quarter of operating cash and increased share repurchases. We are pleased to report these results to you and remains a challenging macro environment. In our data center end market for the fourth quarter, we drove record revenue of $765 million, above our guidance, growing 54% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. The strong revenue growth in the quarter was driven by the cloud portion of our data center end markets. While AI has been a key growth driver, I am pleased that our standard cloud infrastructure revenue has also grown every quarter, and we see that continuing next year. Our 800-gig PAM solutions led our growth in the fourth quarter. We also benefited from higher sequential demand for our storage products as that portion of our data center end market continues its recovery. Revenue from our Teralynx Ethernet switches also grew sequentially in the quarter. Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We expect our overall data center revenue to grow in the low single-digits sequentially on a percentage basis. We expect revenue from both AI and standard cloud data centers to continue to grow sequentially. We project our electro-optics revenue to continue to be strong, and we also expect to benefit from the initial shipments of our cloud optimized AI silicon programs. Partially offsetting this growth, we are projecting a more than seasonal sequential decline in revenue from enterprise on-premise data centers. Over the past several years, Marvell has strategically invested in technology, both organically and through acquisitions to become a critical enabler of accelerated infrastructure. The seismic shift driven by AI in the data center market is creating new opportunities, and we are actively investing to lead the next wave of innovation. We have in place a full suite of solutions across data center interconnect, switching and compute, and the ability to uniquely stitch these together into a unified platform, a true one-stop shop for our data center customers. While our 100-gig per lane 800-gig PAM products are currently the workhorse for interconnect inside AI data centers, customers have begun qualifying our next-generation 200-gig per Lane 1.6T PAM solutions. We expect first deployments to start towards the end of this year. Complementing our optical interconnect solutions, we expect to start ramping our PAM DSPs for active electrical cables. This is a new and completely additive market for Marvell and we expect to be shipping products to multiple Tier 1 cloud customers this year. Our DCI products, which provide connectivity between data centers are critical to our customers' success and continue to do very well. We see exciting new opportunities ahead of us from growth in generative AI applications, driving cloud customers to build new data centers. We also expect a positive uplift from increased investment in inferencing, which will drive more bandwidth between data centers. We are shipping our 400-gig DCI products in high volume today and are seeing strong interest for our next-generation 800-gig products. I'm also very pleased to report to you that in fiscal 2024, we significantly expanded our DCI customer base with design wins at multiple data center customers. We expect these design wins to begin ramping next year. As you will remember from prior calls, Marvell silicon photonics technology has been a critical enabler of our DCI modules. You will hear more at OFC and our upcoming AI event about how we plan to deploy our field-proven silicon photonics technology to enable next-generation higher density, lower power interconnects. In data center switching, our Teralynx 12.8T products continue to ship in high volume and we are on track for production shipments of our next-generation 51.2T switch later this year. The Teralynx product line, you will recall, came from our Innovium acquisition. Combine the Innovium team with Marvell's very successful enterprise and carrier switching organization. This larger scale now enables Marvell to accelerate our development to address new cloud opportunities, particularly in switching for AI deployments. We are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with both existing and new customers, which has expanded our opportunity funnel for cloud switching dramatically over the past year. Turning to our cloud optimized silicon platform. We're seeing significant progress with the first set of design wins outlined during our last Investor Day. We expect initial shipments for our two AI compute programs to start in the first quarter and are on track for a very substantial ramp in the second half of the fiscal year. Customer bring up of these programs is going extremely well, and we are tightly aligned with them on volume expectations and working in lockstep to enable the production. We now have a clear view of demand for both this fiscal year as well as fiscal 2026. We have been working closely with our suppliers and are confident that we have secured capacity for the ramp. With the visibility we now have for these programs, along with many new opportunities, we are very excited about the potential scale of long-term revenue for Marvell from this business. As the initial set of design wins reach its full run rate, we expect annual revenue from cloud optimized silicon has the potential to rival our fast-growing data center optics business, which, for reference, grew to over $1 billion in fiscal 2024. With the exploding investment in AI and accelerated computing, the demand for cloud optimized silicon has grown significantly. We have successfully executed multiple 5-nanometer designs in the last two years and are deeply engaged with cloud customers on many new 3-nanometer opportunities. These engagements are driving a substantial increase in the size of our design funnel. AI is increasing the cadence of new chip releases and this plays well to Marvell's strength as a key partner for our cloud customers with a proven ASIC platform. We have a broad suite of differentiated IP, including ultra high-speed SerDes, armed compute, security, storage and advanced packaging, including die-to-die interconnects and chiplets. We are well positioned to act as a force multiplier for our cloud customers, enabling them to scale multiple custom programs in quick succession. Now let me turn to Marvell's carrier and enterprise end markets together. As we have been communicating, these end markets have been dealing with a period of soft industry demand. As a result, both were down sequentially in the fourth quarter and we expect them to decline again in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect revenue in the first quarter from carrier to decline by approximately 50% and enterprise networking to decline by approximately 40%. Looking ahead, we expect revenue declines in these end markets to be behind us after the first quarter and forecast a recovery in the second half of the fiscal year. Longer term, these are large and enduring end markets, which are critical to the global economy. As a result, we expect both of these end markets to eventually return to contributing over $1 billion each in revenue on an annual basis once demand normalizes, and we begin to realize the benefits of upcoming Marvell-specific product cycles. Turning to the consumer end market. Revenue declined in the fourth quarter as expected and is projected to decline approximately 70% sequentially in the first quarter. This forecast reflects the completion of deliveries for an end-of-life program in the prior quarter as well as significantly weaker demand from the game console market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $82 million, declining 17% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. As expected, the sequential weakness was primarily driven by a sharp decline in the industrial portion of this end market, where order patterns can be lumpy in any given quarter. Fiscal 2024, our automotive business delivered another strong year, with revenue growing in the double-digits year-over-year on a percentage basis. We are benefiting from growth in Marvell content driven by an increase in the number of Ethernet connected endpoints in cars, coupled with the need for more bandwidth. We've continued to accumulate new Ethernet design wins across a broad swath of automotive OEMs. While the initial wave of our automotive revenue was driven primarily by EVs and hybrids, we now have also on high-volume internal combustion vehicles with major auto OEMs. These wins tend to be multi-platform in nature, covering numerous models simultaneously. Turning now to our forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue from our overall auto and industrial end market to be flat sequentially. In summary, in fiscal 2024, we delivered total revenue of $5.5 billion. Our data center revenue accelerated throughout the year, growing from about a third of total company revenue in the first quarter to more than half exiting the fourth quarter. As customers continue to shift investment from traditional to accelerated infrastructure, we expect data center to drive the majority of our revenue growth going forward. This transition underscores Marvell's transformation into a leading data center company. AI was a key driver of our data center growth in fiscal 2024, contributing over 10% of total company revenue, well above our initial forecast. This was a substantial increase from approximately 3% in the prior year. Our momentum accelerated throughout the fiscal year with AI revenue well over $200 million in the fourth quarter, driven mostly from Optics. In fiscal 2025, we expect this trend to continue driving another strong year for our data center end market. We expect a substantial base of electro-optics revenue from AI should remain correlated to accelerator shipments. And as those continue to grow, we expect to benefit accordingly. In addition, we project significant revenue contributions from our AI cloud optimized programs, well in excess of our prior estimate of a couple of hundred million dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, as our cloud optimized AI silicon programs reach high-volume production, we expect our overall cloud optimized revenue to exceed $200 million exiting the fourth quarter. As a result, on a run rate basis, this momentum would put our overall cloud optimized silicon revenue above the annual $800 million target we had provided at our last Investor Day. And with the full year of contributions in fiscal 2026, we expect to be way ahead of the prior target. In aggregate, we see a favorable setup for the second half of this fiscal year, driven by continued growth from our data center end market, ongoing growth from automotive, and a recovery in carrier, enterprise and consumer. As we continue to drive revenue growth, we remain focused on strong cash flow generation and returning capital to investors. As you saw earlier today, Marvell's Board has approved the largest repurchase authorization in our history. We view the emergence of accelerated infrastructure as one of the most significant technology inflections of our time. I thank all our dedicated employees and leaders for executing on our strategy to fully capitalize on this remarkable opportunity. During a tumultuous period for the semiconductor industry, we have taken control of our destiny and are strategically investing to win. Earlier today, we announced the extension of our long-standing collaboration with TSMC to develop the industry's first technology platform to produce 2-nanometer semiconductors optimized for accelerated infrastructure. This new platform will enable Marvell to deliver substantial advancements in performance, power and area critical for next-generation accelerated workloads. We are very optimistic about our growth prospects and our role in enabling accelerated infrastructure. We look forward to updating investors on the massive opportunity in front of us at our accelerated infrastructure for the AI ERA event on April 11 in New York City. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our fiscal year 2024 results. Marvell delivered $5.5 billion in revenue with a strong second half performance from our data center end market. Driven by AI applications, our data center revenue in the second half grew by approximately 50% over the first half. GAAP gross margin was 41.6%, GAAP operating margin was negative 10.3% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $1.08. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.51. We returned $357 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Moving on to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.427 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, growing 1% on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Data center was our largest end market, driving 54% of total revenue. The next largest was enterprise networking with 19%, followed by carrier infrastructure at 12%, consumer at 10% and auto industrial at 5%. GAAP gross margin was 46.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9%, growing 330 basis points sequentially, driven by a significantly better product mix as we had expected. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $697 million, including stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $429 million, in line with our guidance. These results reflect the successful completion of our fiscal 2024 cost reduction plan we had outlined at the beginning of the year. GAAP operating margin was negative 2.3%, while non-GAAP operating margin was 33.8%. For the fourth quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.45, non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.46, growing 12% sequentially. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $547 million. I'm pleased to report to you our second straight quarter, delivering robust operating cash flow of over $500 million. Our inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $864 million, decreasing by $77 million from the prior quarter. Our DSO was 77 days, decreasing by a day from the prior quarter. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends. In addition, we repurchased $100 million of our stock during the fourth quarter, doubling from the prior quarter. We expect to further increase repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. As you saw earlier today, Marvel's Board has approved the largest repurchase authorization in our history, increasing our current plan by $3 billion, which brings our total available authorization to $3.3 billion. Our total debt was $4.17 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.19x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.69x. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $951 million, increasing by $225 million from the prior quarter. Turning to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.15 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 44.5% to 47.2%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63%. We are forecasting a sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin due to lower revenue impacting fixed cost absorption. Looking forward, we expect that the overall level of revenue and product mix will remain key determinants of our gross margin in any given quarter. For the first quarter, we project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $676 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $455 million. This forecast includes a step-up from the prior quarter due to typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. For the first quarter, we expect other income and expense including interest on our debt to be approximately $48 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 7% for the first quarter. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding to be $866 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be $875 million. We anticipate GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of a loss of $0.18 to a loss of $0.28. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.18 to $0.28. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Clearly, it's kind of a tale of two cities, the data center and AI side is going to be really strong, the rest of it not so much. So why don't we just get the bad news out of the way first. The magnitude of the drops ex your data center are kind of shocking. Can you just walk us through how much of that is something that is not going to come back, some of the stuff in 5G, et cetera, versus what do you view as just taking the cyclical medicine and then a snapback should it ensue soon thereafter?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, definitely a tale of two cities. On the carrier enterprise and consumer side, the way to think about it is, sure, the drops are pretty steep in Q4 and Q1. We're definitely going through a cyclical downturn in the industry, you've been doing this a long time, so have I, we've seen that happen, and that's what we're going through. The way to think about both of those businesses is at their peak, together, they were about $2.5 billion in revenue, and this would sort of be during the pandemic and some of the supply chain issues that went on. You can now see we're shipping well below that. And so I said in my prepared remarks, both of these are very solid businesses, Ross, for Marvell. Both will recover to greater than $1 billion in revenue, over time, the question is when. And remember as well, within these businesses, these are very long product life cycles, typically like seven years in production. So these are designs. In some cases, we won 3 or 4, 5 years ago, some of them we just won a year or two ago. So we feel good about these businesses, but they are going through some demand softness and some inventory correction, but we expect to see that behind us. And to be very specific, none of this is due to any business that's not “coming back or share loss”. And in fact, when things recover back to a normalized run rate, we do have Marvell product growth drivers in both of those segments, carrier and enterprise to drive growth going forward. So we're just managing through it in the short term.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt Ramsey with TD Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: I guess kind of a two-part question on the custom silicon business. The first part of it, Matt, you gave us some good color in your script as to how you see $200 million exiting the year and exceeding the $800 million for next. You kind of referenced the billion dollars at scale. And I just wonder if you could maybe square the rest of that, circle with that just for business you've won today for fiscal '26 or is there more to come? And I guess the second part of the question, my observation is you guys probably have, A, more shots on goal for custom silicon, and B, each one of the shots on goal could be potentially a very large or larger than expected piece of business given what's happening in the AI trend. But I guess my concern is as you evaluate those opportunities when those programs will be shipping 2, 3, 4 years in advance and trying to figure out how those programs would sort of align with the dominant player in the space's road map 2 or 3 years out and the pace of that innovation. Like how do you guys evaluate the potential for the size of the business when lots of shots on goal, but the probability of each of those shots ongoing being successful might be hard to gauge given how quickly the industry is moving. Hopefully, that makes sense. I'm just trying to get an idea of how you're scaling the business and taking on orders given all the volatility and rapid technology advancements in this space.\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Let me just tackle them both. On the first one, yes, super excited about the ramp we're seeing now on the custom silicon programs we won a couple of years back. So we're shipping in Q1 on both programs. It's fantastic. We gave some color in the prepared remarks on the exit rate being $200 million plus. I don't want to cap that at this point, but certainly, that's sort of the way to think about it as the floor, and then we go from there. So that would imply, obviously, in fiscal '26, a much larger number than the $800 million we had called out. And again, I think it's still dynamic and still early but we're very excited from the bullish forecast we're seeing from our customers. So '26 looks very strong from the programs that we've won, and we should be way ahead of the plan that we had articulated a ways back. On the second question, yes, I don't think I've ever seen more design win activity in my career as right now, in AI, custom silicon, networking, optics, you name it, this whole transformation that's going on and data center architectures is creating this massive opportunity for Marvell specifically on the custom portion of it. I mean, we're talking about a TAM creation that's going to be in the tens of billions of dollars range. And we'll talk more about that at our AI Day. But very significant sort of opportunity that's emerging in front of us. And that being said, I view that as very complementary to the merchant leader in this space. I think both have a place given the workloads that are required, given the scale of computing that's needed. And I don't think it's a zero-sum game. I've been saying this for a while. I think both segments, the merchant side as well as the custom side are going to grow to be very enormous TAMs. And so yes, we're right in the mix on all the major opportunities and programs. We have assembled an incredible team, an incredible portfolio of technology. We announced today our continued partnership with TSMC with a very full and robust roadmap of IP and technology to specifically address AI and accelerated computing applications for the next generation. So that's got a lot of excitement with the customers as well. So yes, overall, we're very bullish, and we think the whole -- all the boats are going to lift on this one and certainly for Marvell creates a huge new TAM opportunity that we really didn't have just a few years ago.\nOperator: The next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.\nChristopher Rolland: I guess, first of all, Matt, thanks for giving the custom ASIC opportunity numbers again. I think that means, probably means you guys have a pretty strong pipeline. But I would love to drill down on that a little bit more. So I guess, first of all, maybe you can talk about these opportunities, training versus inference, how you see that versus perhaps just compute? And then what's kind of the -- do you have a secret sauce that's landing these? Like your competitor has really used there at the time, leading edge SerDes IP as a driver of those wins. Is there something that you have some special sauce that are winning these?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, hopefully, some of the custom numbers were helpful. Investors last year and this year, there was a lot of interest in sort of what the size of that was. And now that we've got the visibility, it's great to start articulating where we think that is. I think on your second sort of piece of your question around training versus inference and compute. At this point, I would just put it in a very large bucket of what I'm calling decabillions [ph] in TAM creation. I don't know that we're -- I'm on this call certainly prepared to slice it out. And I don't even think we know where this is going to be in three to five years relative to that exact split. But I would say the opportunity set for us crosses all of those applications, okay? And then relative to where we are in terms of our technology, our competitiveness, I mean it's pretty astonishing if you think about it. When we won the designs we won, Chris, at 5-nanometer, that was really our first time as Marvell to compete in this segment, especially in the data center. The origins of this business go back to our purchase of Avera in 2019. We pivoted that roadmap during dependency of the close and right after from 14-nanometer technology all the way to 5-nanometer and even though it was our first time out, SerDes was competitive, packaging technology, interconnect, manufacturing scale, strategic partnerships up and down the supply chain, and that enabled us to win a significant share of ASICs in business, which is now coming to fruition here in fiscal '25 and '26. We followed that up with our 3-nanometer platform, which has now been a big part of the opportunity set in the funnel we're competing in today. We are in a completely different position now relative to 5-nanometer because we had the learnings, we had the readiness. And now we're really leaning in, okay, in terms of being a first mindset around not just nanometers, but die-to-die interconnect, packaging, SerDes technology, optics and really in chiplets and think about how to stitch all this together. And on top of that, with the scale of Marvell and our strategic partnerships, we really look to our customers like an incredibly solid, trustworthy long-term partner for their needs to really help them realize their AI silicon ambitions. So that’s where we are today. I mean we did great on 5-nanometer, we’re going to do great on 3-nanometer, and we’re going to do great in the future. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.\nQuinn Bolton: I'm going to follow-up on the cloud ASIC question as well. But I guess I'm coming at it from a margin perspective. Matt, you look at some of these programs on the cloud compute side to the extent that they integrate high-bandwidth memory. It certainly does nice things to the ASP, but there's also a pretty significant costs that you may have to pass through. And so I'm wondering, can you talk about the gross margins on some of these ASIC platforms, how does that compare to the corporate average? And as you ramp, especially if cloud ASICs get to be similar in size to the optics, which I know are good margins, how do you see the margin mix changing with this now very, very strong ramp of cloud ASIC programs? And then I've got a quick follow-up, if I can sneak it in.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. I mean on the way we've talked about that business, actually since Avera in 2019 is that it would always due to the nature of custom business be at a lower gross margin overall than the company average and the target. At the same time, because of the NRE and non-recurring engineering that we receive as part of the customer funding of these programs, the operating margins of this business tend to be very competitive and over time, in line with our company targets. When you start talking about these very, very large programs, you've got opportunity given the volume and scale on the OM line to really drive a lot of leverage in the model. But the GMs, just due to the nature of that business model will always be a little bit lower than the total. I would say, though, at the same time, because the sort of follow-on sometimes is we'll see if that happens and what happens to the overall company gross margin profile. And remember, we still have very strong gross margin merchant businesses in storage and in networking, automotive. Some of those were even under-shipping demand right now. So as the year plays out, some of those businesses will come back and that should be a little bit of a margin offset to some of the custom stuff. So we're still managing to our long-term target model. But yes, the cloud stuff, especially if these volumes certainly lower gross margin. You got a quick one for the second? We can do it, otherwise, we've got to [indiscernible].\nQuinn Bolton: Yes, quick one on the second. You mentioned sort of ramping AECs at multiple hyperscalers this year. Just wondering if you might be able to give us some sense. Is that meaningful? Any sense on the magnitude of that ramp?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. I think what I'd say is it's absolutely a real market. We felt that way for some time. Even back when we acquired Inphi, that was sort of a shot on goal we thought was possible. I think the big news is that we're qualifying at multiple hyperscalers now. We're starting to go into production this year. We'll get a very nice, solid kind of more full year-ish ramp in fiscal '26 but it's definitely an incremental additive category to Marvell. And it really leverages our high-speed or high-performance DSP and PAM technology, which is really now inflecting in this wave of AC before it was based on the older modulation techniques which where we didn't participate. So yes, really excited about it, but let it play out for a few more quarters.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Matt. So AI is hot, there's no other way to put it. You are in kind of a pole position with your optical piece, Inphi piece. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the size of that business, either quarterly or last year? Anything you can provide us that helps us size it? And also kind of what kind of growth rate you expect to see from this business? And then, Matt, when you say the bottom is for some of the pieces like consumer and networking the bottom will be this 1Q time frame, what piece do you think will come off the bottom in 2Q? Or do you expect all the pieces to come off the bottom in 2Q?\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Let me do this. I'll take the first one, and I'll let Willem take the second one. So I can take a breather and he can you can also answer your question. Yes, on the first one, I think we gave some pretty good color. I mean, if you think about it, the Q4 exit rate on AI, right, was well north of $200 million. And the bulk of that, as we said, was in optics. So if you just -- and then you can start extrapolating well jeez, and you got to add in how much revenue is Marvell getting on the standard cloud side in optics, and that's another very nice chunk. And then you've got some of the stuff that we have that shows up on the carrier side, I'm talking about Inphi now, on the coherent DSPs. There's some ASICs that we have. So the overall Inphi business, if that's what you're asking, since we bought it has clearly outperformed the deal model and has just become an incredibly strategic asset for us, both in terms of just the technology we picked up, but the team, the synergy with the other portfolio, the other product lines we have, and so just super positive about that, and it looks like that whole opportunity is going to be much larger than I think we were in [indiscernible] just a few years back. Willem, do you want to take the second part of it?\nWillem Meintjes: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, so we're really working with customers to focus on Q1 being the bottom, really confident that, that's the bottom. And then we see growth resuming in the second half across enterprise networking, carrier and consumer. So really just trying to make sure that we put this behind us really quickly and see growth in the second half.\nOperator: The next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Matt, one more on electro-optics. I think near term, it seems in Q1, there's probably a little bit of a breather after several strong quarters. But the more important question is that should we assume that your electro-optics that is related to AI should grow somewhat proportional to the growth in accelerators? So for example, if you look at accelerator growth this year, I've seen various numbers between 50% to 100%, kind of year-on-year growth. So should the AI part of your electro-optics grow kind of commensurate with that? Or is there something different? And then when does 1.62, 1.16, 1.6T, sorry, when does that start to play a role in your electro-optics business?\nMatt Murphy: Well, I think it depends on how you -- the definition of breather you use. I mean, basically, it's ramped up just so significantly, right, the Electro-optics business Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4, and staying strong in Q1, maybe it's a breather from the sequential growth point of view, but we still have not seen that slow down. And then on the -- let's see, I got your second one. The third one was on 1.6T, I'll come back to your second one in a second. That is going to ramp later this year. That's gone really well. The quals and the product bring up. We announced at OFC last year and a lot of demand and interest. And then sorry, your second question on AI?\nVivek Arya: Yes. So should your electro-optics grow kind of proportional to the growth and accelerator. Yes.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Sorry, yes, the accelerator. For sure. The way we think about it is the -- that business year-over-year should grow in line with accelerator growth -- accelerator unit growth. We view it as very correlated. Obviously, there's some timing issues in terms of supply chain and things like that. But that's a simple way to think about it, and everyone's got a little bit of a different model at this point about what that number is, but our view is we're highly correlated to accelerator shipments, in our optics business.\nOperator: The next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.\nGary Mobley: As a way to think about the win or hit rate for your custom ASIC business when engaging with prospective customers in the future, how should we think about the increasing competitive environment from the Arm ecosystem, Arm specifically with more versions than Neoverse, it's total design ecosystem, it's compute subsystems and as well all the ASIC design community. First of all, how do you feel about Arm essentially becoming more of a competitor? And then as well, how do you think about the way in which you'll compete against that and succeed?\nMatt Murphy: Look, I think there's a in this market today, there's obviously a lot of excitement because of the opportunity in front of us. I mean the way that we're working is there's a number of companies that are our partners, solution providers, et cetera that may or may have their own offering or not, whether it gets taken up or not as we'll have to see. Where we come together really is we pull it all together. We're able to actually deliver with Marvell intellectual property, design methodology and techniques, our IP, and our know-how pulled together with our customers RTL and IP and partners, the total solution, which means we actually lay the chip out. We package it up. we manufacture it in high volume. We QA it, we test it, we yield it, we drive reliability, we drive cost improvement, and we drive it through the cycle. And that is a very different business model than providing a piece that goes in. And so Arm has been our partner for a long time. We use them in our products kind of all over the place. And as they evolve and others evolve, we'll figure that out too. But in the end, it comes down to, we believe, for these large volume mission-critical big compute silicon chips it's going to require somebody like a Marvell with the manufacturing scale, the design techniques and know-how to really execute it. And so we haven't seen any change there. And in fact, I think at the sort of 3-nanometer node we're at and beyond, it's going to be even more critical to have a partner who's got your back, who can help you get to production quickly and spin derivatives quickly, which is now increasingly looking like what’s going to be needed, more SKUs, higher -- faster beat rate in terms of when products are released and then obviously ramping them very hard and quickly given the competitive environment.\nOperator: The next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Matt, you mentioned the initial shipments of your AI ASIC program. Can you just clarify because I know last you updated us, these programs were in qualification. So have you guys passed qual on both these programs? And is it sort of the initial start of the full production ramp? Or maybe you're still in qual, but you've got enough line of sight to passing the qual just given you're at the tail end of this process? And maybe more importantly, have you guys secured the follow-on AI programs for these two initial projects?\nMatt Murphy: So yes, we are in the initial start of the production ramp on both products. And then as far as the follow-on, like I said, the opportunity funnel we see across all of the various opportunities right now is significant, and we're involved in, we believe, we think, every single one of them. So yes, and there'll be more to come sort of at our AI Day, but I would just say our 3-nanometer funnel and our 3-nanometer hit rate and design win rate is very encouraging and it really gives us this tremendous confidence in where this business is headed. It also has a side benefit by driving this advanced technology for the custom ASIC side, is it's pulling along the technology development that benefits all the other businesses in Marvell, like our high-performance switching, our DSP for optics, et cetera. So there's actually kind of a virtuous cycle happening where being at that bleeding edge is now we're able to show our other solutions that interoperate with this custom silicon, really a best-in-class roadmap there. But more on the overall strategy and opportunity size at the AI though. [indiscernible].\nOperator: Your next question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.\nTore Svanberg: Matt, I had a question on the 800-gig upgrade cycle. So you mentioned that ramping, but you also mentioned 1.6 Terabit ramping later this year. My understanding is that we're still in the early stages of the 800 gig. And I'm just wondering if you expect a more broad-based 800-gig upgrade cycle before 1.6T really starts to take off? Or will we potentially see kind of both ramping at the same time?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, I think there's three different pieces we should talk about. So the first is 1.6T. I would just call that early shipments, first volumes type of thing in the second half, end of the year and then more next year. And that's really, I'd call the early adoption of that technology. But it's very promising because that's obviously what's going to follow. The 800 gig for AI has still got tons of legs, right? And it's going to be very, very strong this year, very, very strong next year. And then there'll be some transition over time. And then I think what you're also indicating is, at some point, you're going to see an 800-gig transition on traditional cloud infrastructure from either 200-gig or 400-gig to 800-gig and that is also true in something we're planning for. So I think they're going to end up happening kind of all them in parallel a little bit, right? You're going to have leading-edge people adopting 1.6T. You're going to have the bulk of the volume on AI, still driving 800-gig for the next few years and then you're going to have a transition on the traditional PAM side as well that's going to upgrade. So I think they’re all going to be in production in parallel for different reasons, which is great because it just ends up being multiple customers, multiple SKUs and kind of a rich portfolio of solutions that we’re offering so that people can optimize their systems for the best TCO and the best performance that they need.\nOperator: We will take our last question today from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James.\nSrini Pajjuri: Just a follow-up to one of the previous questions, Matt, about the custom silicon opportunity going forward. Obviously, there are four big cloud customers, hyperscale customers. And based on what we know so far, most of them seem to be investing in custom silicon either 1 or 2 chips. So it does feel like the number of opportunities are relatively small. Of course, these are very large opportunities. Just curious, how do you see that evolving? Do you see this continuing with 1 or 2 programs for each customers, which are in a multibillion opportunities or are you seeing spreading out kind of more diverse opportunities as we -- I guess, as AI becomes bigger and broader? Just want to hear your thoughts on that.\nMatt Murphy: The way I think about it is if you go back just a couple of years, when AI was emerging, there was kind of 1 chip, 1 program that would sort of happen. It would take several years, then you gear up for the next one. And there was definitely a serial type of approach, and that was probably fine. I think what we've seen, to your point is really multiple programs now across all the key customers and that's kind of where I'd leave it. I think getting more specific, I don't really want to do that with respect to my customers. But I would just say what we hear is very much a need for each of them meeting their own very differentiated unique solutions, meeting more SKUs and at a much more rapid rate by far than we've seen so far. And so I just think it's creating -- I think, I know it's creating just a very significant, now, opportunity in custom silicon that really wasn't there before in terms of the total dollars that are available, the number of chips and then the speed that they want to go. And that’s why earlier I had said, if you look at this kind of 3-nanometer cycle we’re in, it’s significantly larger than we saw back at 5-nanometer, even if you account for the fact that some of these the 5-nanometer TAMs have gone up a lot because the market went up, even if you sort of factor that in, what we’re looking at is a lot more. And I think that’s just going to continue for the next few years. But sure, by design, I think any of the high-volume data center applications are always going to in any product line, by the way, always concentrate down to a few key partners. That’s just the way the business works. But super exciting time. There’s a lot of activity here. Was that the last question operator?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Go ahead sir, take the floor.\nMatt Murphy: Excellent. All right. So first, everybody appreciate the participation on the call today. It's a very exciting time in the semiconductor industry relative to sort of the opportunity that's in front of us. We see a huge transformation underway right now with fundamentally a complete overhaul of data centers and data center architectures. And Marvell, we've been on this journey for the last four or five years to really transition and transform ourselves into a data center company. And as you've seen from our recent results now that is our largest end market, it's where we're putting the majority of our R&D effort, and we're positioning the company to win big here. We chose the strategy years ago to be really levered to the accelerated computing and infrastructure part of the market, which includes in the most prominent piece being AI. It's become much larger of an opportunity than we thought a few years ago, but it's a market we clearly chose to invest in. We're expecting a lot of growth in the coming year in our data center business. We're very excited about that. And some of these programs as I indicated, they're just getting started, and some of them are ramping in the second half. Some of them are starting to ramp now, but it really gives us a great setup for our fiscal '26. And kind of final couple of comments. I get a lot of thought about -- and we did a lot of work with our customers over the break this past December. And early January, I did a fireside chat with Harlan at JPM, and there was a lot of excitement after that call because we had gained confidence at that point about some of the production ramps. I would say just a couple of months later now sitting here on this call, our confidence in our growth this year and the robustness of these programs has only gotten stronger and only increased. So we’re very excited about where the company is positioned. I appreciate everybody’s support and interest in Marvell. And I look forward to seeing everybody at the AI Day. Team is working extremely hard, and they will not disappoint. So thanks, everybody. We’ll see you soon. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Marvell Technology Inc. Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's third fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO; and Willem Meintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Let me now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on this quarter. Matt? \nMatt Murphy : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell delivered revenue of $1.42 billion, growing 6% sequentially above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, on a non-GAAP basis, the Marvell team drove a sequential increase in gross margin, remain disciplined on operating expenses and delivered EPS of $0.41, above the midpoint of our guidance. We are pleased with our results in execution.  In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $556 million, well above our guidance, driven by stronger than forecasted AI revenue. We are also encouraged by revenue from cloud, returning to year-over-year growth. On a sequential basis, overall data center revenue grew 21% in the third quarter, while cloud grew well in excess of 30%.  As expected revenue from the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market declined sequentially in the third quarter, reflecting weakening demand. Demand for data center storage also remains depressed, and industry expectations for recovery have continued to push out.  In cloud, revenue from both AI and standard cloud infrastructure grew sequentially, with AI growing significantly faster. Growth was broad based led by our PAM4 optical products. Teralynx Ethernet switches, as well as our data center interconnect, or DCI products.  Earlier today, we released a video highlighting our long standing collaboration with NVIDIA, where using Marvell's optical interconnect technology to enable the bandwidth scale and reliability required by Generative AI. Marvell has built a broad product portfolio which are customers are relying upon to power their accelerated computing infrastructure. We are benefiting from strong demand for 800-gig PAM electro-optic products, tightly correlated to the growth of in deployment of AI accelerators. In fact, we are seeing the overall attach rate of our PAM products to accelerators being higher than one to one in high performance AI systems currently shipping in the market.  We're also seeing strong customer traction for our next generation 1.6T 200-gig per lane PAM platform, that we started sampling this past April. Customer qualifications have begun and we are looking forward to ramping our 1.6T solution into production. Complementing our optical solutions, we expect our PAM DSPs for the active electrical cable, or AEC market to start ramping in our next fiscal year in Tier 1 cloud deployments. We also demonstrated our 224 gigabits per second, long-reach SerDes at the OCP Global Summit held in October. We expect that this technology will serve as a building block for our next generation 200-gig per lane AECs.  In our switching portfolio, we are making great progress on our next generation 51.2T cloud switching platform. At OCP, we demonstrated Marvell's 51.2T solution, operating at full capacity with very low industry leading latency running on SONiC. Our enabled Meta SONiC and agile open source network operating system is very important for cloud customers who value the flexibility, interoperability and scalability of an open Ethernet switch ecosystem. Customers have started development on our 51.2T solution, and we look forward to ramping this platform into production.  In addition, earlier this week, we announced our membership in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. This is another step in our commitment to driving continuous innovation on an open Ethernet based cloud fabric, which can deliver the scale and performance required for next generation workloads including generative AI.  As our 400 gig DCI modules continue to ramp, we're also seeing strong interest for our next generation 800 gig products that we launched this past October. These modules are based on our new 5-nanometer 800 gig coherent DSP and silicon photonics, or SiPho platform, which integrates multiple discrete components within a single device. This level of integration enables the performance and packaging density required for small form factor pluggable modules to grab a high bandwidth signal across long distances between data centers. Marvell’s SiPho platform has accumulated billions of operating hours over the past seven years in DCI applications.  In addition, we are starting to see emerging applications for our field proven SiPho technology to power next generation higher bandwidth and optical connections inside data centers. We look forward to updating investors as this opportunity unfolds over time.  Cloud customers remain focused on enhancing their AI offerings by building custom compute solutions of their own, and we have already won a number of these designs. We have completed qualification of 1 key AI project and have started wafers under production. For another project, we have received first silicon back from the fab and the initial testing is looking positive. As a result, we expect both of these custom compute programs to start volume production next year. Turning now to our guidance for overall data center end market. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our data center end market to grow in the mid-30% range on a sequential basis. In our last earnings call, we provided a forecast for AI revenue to cross a $200 million quarterly run rate exiting this year. Since then, demand has continued to grow, and we now expect our AI revenue in the fourth quarter to come in significantly above our forecast.  In addition to strong growth from AI, we also expect revenue from standard cloud infrastructure to grow sequentially in the fourth quarter. For the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $317 million, above guidance growing 17% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The overachievement in the third quarter was driven entirely by the wireless portion of our carrier end market. Marvell specific product cycles have enabled our wireless revenue to buck the trend of a soft end market for several quarters. However, we have been forecasting for some time that this wave of above-market wireless growth for Marvell would start to decline by the fourth quarter as the initial wave of 5G rollout completion.  Additionally, demand is continuing to soften as carriers are managing CapEx in a difficult macroeconomic environment. As a result, following an extended multiyear period of strong growth, we are expecting a period of digestion. In addition, we expect revenue from the wired portion of our carrier end markets to continue to decline, reflecting weakening demand. As a result, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-40% range on a sequential basis. Looking longer term as data traffic continues to grow, we expect that operators will need to continue to invest in adding capacity in both the wireless and wired end markets. We also expect to benefit from share gains, including significant 5-nanometer base station design wins, which we have won but are not in production. We are optimistic that carrier CapEx will normalize over time, and our revenue from this end market will return to growth. Turning to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $271 million, declining 28% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. As we have been signaling, we see weak demand in this end market. As a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we project enterprise networking revenue to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis.  Turning to our automotive and industrial end markets. Revenue in the third quarter was $107 million, growing 26% year-over-year and declining 3% sequentially. Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our overall auto and industrial end market to decline by approximately 20% on a sequential basis. We expect the sequential decline to come from our industrial end market, which includes aerospace and defense, where order patterns can be lumpy in any given quarter. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $169 million, declining 5% year-over and growing 1% sequentially. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting revenue from the consumer end market to sequentially decline in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. In summary, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP earnings above the midpoint of guidance for the fiscal third quarter. The diversification in our end markets is serving us well with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through a softening demand environment across other end markets.  Through fiscal 2024, the Marvell team has continued to execute in a dynamic environment, remaining focused on driving continuous improvement on what we can control while dealing with inventory corrections and macroeconomic-induced demand headwinds in many end markets.  We reprioritized our investments to align to the highest ROI opportunities in front of us. Our team drove efficiency improvements to reduce operating expenses, and we are well on track to meet our commitment. We've worked proactively with our customers and suppliers to best manage inventory across the combined supply chain. Our operations group has rapidly responded to the increase in demand from AI. At the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, we are forecasting that our revenue for the second half of this fiscal year should grow approximately 7% over the first half. In addition, we are forecasting a 300-plus basis point sequential improvement in our non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter. This projection reflects our expectation for an improving product mix as well as a multi-quarter cross-functional effort to further optimize our cost structure. Heading into next year, while we don't typically guide beyond a quarter, we expect softness in demand to impact revenue from our enterprise and carrier markets in the first quarter. We also anticipate a significant reduction in consumer end market revenue due to seasonality in demand and the completion of deliveries for an end-of-life program in the fourth quarter. Although the enterprise and carrier markets are experiencing near-term headwinds, these large and long-lasting end markets are critical to the global economy. So we expect them to recover and turn into our revenue tailwind over time. In the meantime, our data center revenue is growing rapidly, reflecting our emergence as a key enabler of accelerated computing. We project data center revenue, driven by the ongoing strength in our connectivity solutions inside and between data centers to grow to over 50% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. Longer term, we expect additional tailwinds to data center growth from the ramp of multiple custom accelerated compute programs for AI. We are also looking forward to a number of new Marvell products entering the data center market, as I discussed earlier. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.49 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, declining 8% year-over-year and growing 6% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 39% of total revenue. The next largest was carrier infrastructure with 22%, followed by enterprise networking at 19%, consumer at 12% and auto industrial at 8%. GAAP gross margin was 38.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.6%, growing 30 basis points sequentially, driven by higher revenue and cost improvements. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $698 million, including stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $437 million, in line with our guidance. GAAP operating margin was negative 10.3%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.8%. For the third quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.19. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.41, $0.01 above the midpoint of guidance. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $503 million, which grew by $391 million sequentially. This significant growth was driven by our relative improvement in DSO, lower inventory along with better profitability. Our inventory at the end of the third quarter was $942 million decreasing by $74 million from the prior quarter. Our DSO was 78 days, reducing by 4 days from the prior quarter. Our CapEx was $54 million. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends and we repurchased $50 million of our stock during the third quarter. Our total debt was $4.19 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.21 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.83 times.  During the quarter, we issued new bonds and used the proceeds to pay down our upcoming debt maturities. With our investment-grade credit rating, we were able to execute this refinancing while decreasing our average interest rate on our outstanding debt balance. In addition, we increased our average debt maturity from 3.9 years to 5.3 years. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $726 million increasing by $202 million from the prior quarter. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.42 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 48.2% to 50.7%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, with the midpoint projected to be back to the low end of our long-term target model. Our forecast for this large sequential improvement is driven by expectations of a significantly stronger product mix and our ongoing cost optimization activities. Looking forward, we expect that product mix as well as the overall level of revenue will remain key determinants of our gross margin in any given quarter. For the fourth quarter, we project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $680 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million. This level of operating expense reflects the completion of the cost reduction plan we communicated in our first fiscal quarter of this year. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we anticipate typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. As a result, we expect OpEx to increase by mid- to high single digits on a percentage basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt to be approximately $50 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 6% for the fourth quarter, increasing to 7% in fiscal 2025. We expect our basic average shares outstanding to be 865 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be $874 million. We anticipate GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of a loss of $0.08 to a gain of $0.02 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.41 to $0.51. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Matt, I had a multipart question on your data center business. It sounds like the outlook has improved since 90 days ago. Just curious how if you can size the AI business for us where you landed in the October quarter, it sounds like you'll be in excess of $200 million in Q4, but the outlook there. And then more importantly, into calendar '24, if you can speak to visibility you have across your optical business as well as the compute business that would be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. We're very pleased with the performance of our data center business grew over 20%. In Q3, we're guiding it up 35%, in Q4, as you noted, that is driven by AI and the Q4 exit rate is well north now of $200 million. What's very encouraging as well is that the traditional cloud infrastructure piece of it is also growing nicely. That's come back very strong for us. And those two will be growth drivers for us into next year. We see continued weakness in softness, and this is a broader market statement than the on-premise piece and that probably persists for some time, but the mix now of cloud and AI is so much higher that it's driving the overall segment in a very positive trajectory, both in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And then as we head into next year, as you've seen, most of the strong growth we saw in the current fiscal year in AI and cloud infra for that matter has been in the optics area, but we are tracking well for growth their next year as well as the ramp of our custom silicon programs. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the strong progress we made on new product development and starting to plan for ramps there.  So while we're not resizing those specifically, those -- the performance clearly in the fourth quarter as well as what you would how you think about next year is much, much stronger than when we first signaled the AI opportunity for Marvell a couple of quarters back. So I think things are tracking nicely. And as you said, compared to 90 days ago, I think the overall aggregate data center business, as you can see from our results, is doing quite well.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead. \nTimothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Matt I also had a multipart question. So enterprise networking is going to be down about 35% from the peak in fiscal Q4. And the customers are still though reporting that their inventory levels are actually going up. So is this Marvell product? Is this product from another supplier? And can you talk about just the dynamics going on in that segment? And then also for fiscal Q1, do you still think that revenue can grow? I know you said that networking is down and carriers down. But data center would be up. Do you think that total revenue can be up? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Tim, and appreciate the creativity on the 2-parter, but no problem. On the enterprise side, it's hard to comment. I mean if you look, balance sheets are still pretty heavy from the OEMs out there. We've been saying, I think since even going back to December of last year that enterprise was going to come down this year and it's just continued to come down. I think there's a combination of both inventory management at the OEM level as well as from some of the projections you see out there at the end market level, a softer and more weakening demand environment.  So we still feel very good about our position. We had grown this business significantly from where it was just a few years ago. We had great years the last couple of years and even in the first half of this year. So we're going through what would be kind of a normal inventory correction cycle. It's taking a little bit longer than we thought if you went back to the beginning of the year, but I also think the macro and the environment has deteriorated more than we would have anticipated at that time. And so we see it down, and we see that having to work through that issue for the next couple of quarters. On Q1, while we don't guide specifically, I understand what you're looking for. I think the way to think about it is that, and I guess I gave the information. Carrier is down after a really great run in Q4, that's going to stay weak. The telco environment and CapEx spending is very constrained out there and the end customers seem to be having some trouble. We talked about enterprise being down. And then on consumer, which actually did a little bit better than we thought it would have this year. The last time buy program that we had has been largely going to conclude now in the fourth quarter, and so we see a stepping down there. So, if you kind of add all that up, that's about half our revenue that's going to come down in Q1. And then the real question is the data center strength and how does that continue? And it's too early to call, but just the way to think about it is it's a lot to offset at this juncture when you have that much of your revenue coming down.  The last thing I would say, though, on carrier and enterprise is that these are -- this is a cyclical downturn on these and the kind of design win strength we've had in the design position we had is such that these will recover, and they will come back to a normalized run rate over time. And when that happens, that will be a tailwind to EPS and a tailwind to revenue growth as that kind of think of it as the base business of Marvell returns to growth.  And in the meantime, our diversified strategy is working well because we've got AI and cloud that's really firing on all cylinders. So a lot of information there. You guys are going to have to up with your own model, but hopefully, that gave you some pieces on how to think about it.\nTimothy Arcuri: Wonderful. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nVivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Matt, so I think in the data center, the value of the optics business, I think, is well understood and appreciate it. The challenge is still for us to how we value your ASIC business. So is it 1 or 2 customers? Is it more customers? How is the visibility for the next 1 or 2 years? Like are we talking $100 million to $200 million next year? Are we talking $300 million, $400 million next year? Because unless we have a good way of sizing what this business is and what the visibility and what the growth potential, it's just very hard to value and give appropriate value to Marvell for this business. So could you just help us understand what is the right way you think about your ASIC business, can the lumpiness here really swing your sales next year?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think a couple of ways to think about it. The first is on the customer opportunity, just by design, it's highly concentrated, if you think about it. And there's just a handful of companies that can really drive the kind of silicon TAM opportunity that that's out there. And you've probably seen in the last few weeks, there's just been a tremendous number of announcements across the industry around AI, whether it's strategic partnerships that are being announced, people doing their own silicon, behind that, their own silicon. There's typically partners there, people like Marvell, who are going to participate. So a lot of activity, you can see and I would say even one broader statement, then I'll get to your question.  We do see as the TAM is moving from traditional computing architectures to accelerated computing, it is really opening up the custom silicon piece of that. And so that we believe will be a larger portion of the TAM going forward. When we talked about sizing, if you remember, a couple of quarters back, our AI opportunity, we had signaled already that this year, we would do about $400 million on the optical area. Well, said another way, we do about $400 million this year in total AI revenue, most of it driven by optics and that next year would be about $800 million. That was the original sort of bogey we put out to help investors to your point, size this. And then you would assume some optics growth, and so you could sort of do the math on what the difference might be.  Now AI's got a bigger head of steam than it was back then. The optics piece is higher and we've made significant progress now on new product development in terms of getting the chips actually taped out and through the fab and now starting to think about ramping. But what I would say is, and I've been saying this to investors for about 6 months, we are not in a position to call the ball just yet on how big the custom silicon opportunity can be for next year. It's still early, Vivek. I understand the investor appetite for this.  I would say between us and our customers, we're not fully -- we don't fully know how big this can be yet. So I'm going to need a little bit more time to probably size that for you. But what I can say is from when we first talked about AI 2 quarters back and what the opportunity was looking out to next year, it's much, much higher. And that's both on the custom side as well as on the optic side. So I hope that helps. I understand the question, but it's a pretty dynamic market as you see what's going on. But the good news is it's all moving in a very positive and upward direction.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nHarsh Kumar : Yes. Thanks guys. Great tremendous execution and very choppy environment. So Matt, a question for you was on the carrier side, you're guiding down significantly down mid-40s on a sequential basis. And I think you mentioned both the wired and the wireless pieces are down. I was curious if you can help us think about perhaps what is taking the bigger part of the hit. And which one do you have more confidence in, in terms of returning back to growth first?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Harsh. And it is a choppy environment, as you point out. Look, I think on carrier, we're coming off a very, very strong Q3. It was over $300 million. And I think if you just kind of infer the whole year, it's going to be -- have been like a $1 billion business for Marvell. So I think that's been a success story for us. Clearly, some -- and we've been trying to signal if you go back over the last couple of calls, we've attempted to signal to investors the fourth quarter that there would be -- that sort of the third quarter would be the peak of 5G stuff, and then it would take some time for that to judge that through. And we bucked the trend, if you remember, on our performance here. So both of those are -- that carrier segment is a strong segment for Marvell. It will return over time, back to a normalized run rate, but it's very lumpy and volatile as carrier usually is. What I would say on the timing, I think they're both going to come back. It's just -- it's hard to know exactly when on these. I think the predictability in the segment is tough. So I don't think I have an exact answer on which one comes back sooner. I'd say wire has been trending down for some time as I think some of that pandemic led infrastructure build has waned. The carrier 5G stuff has really performed extremely well for us this year.  And by the way, when it does come back, both on the carrier on the wireless and wired side, we have incremental design wins in those segments. One is incremental content base stations with the Layer 2 processor opportunity and also our new 800-gig DSPs for carrier -- for wired infrastructure, those are going to be new revenue drivers for us when we come back out of this. So timing is still unknown. But I would just say that this is a part of the base business of Marvell, kind of the core part of Marvell that over time will return to a normalized run rate.\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Please go ahead. \nTore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you Matt, you mentioned the NVIDIA and Marvell partnership, and I do appreciate the video on your website, but could you add a little bit more color on exactly what this means. I assume this is a multiyear partnership. But yes, any additional color you could share with us would be great? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Tore. I think yes, the video was posted today, but it really, I think, just sort of captures a very long-term working relationship between the two companies across a number of opportunities, by the way. I think we've had a complementary and very strong partnership with NVIDIA to really help enable them and their products.  In the optical area, we've been working with them for some time, and this goes back even to working with Mellanox in some of their applications. So this was really a way just to, I think, highlight the years of work we've done together and also signify that there's a lot of opportunity for us to kind of double down together on this AI opportunity. So we're proud to be a partner of them and support them in their growth. That's really what's behind it. It's not a new announcement or anything per se. It's just a recognition of a long-standing cooperation between the 2 companies.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Since that was kind of a soft question, I had a question on the enterprise networking business. It sounds like the sequential decline is going to be a little bit better than what we've seen lately. Is that a sign that you're starting to see stability there? Or are the order rates and the visibility is still very limited?\nMatt Murphy: I'd say it's still limited. I think it's still coming down. And I think we're -- we want to see when the customer balance sheets get back in shape to them talk a little bit more robustly about their end market demand, strengthening before we make a call there. So we'll have to see where enterprise IT spending really ends up, Tore, next year, given the macro. And so right now, we're just sort of taking it week by week, and we're monitoring what products they need and looking at their forecast for next year, and we're trying to plan accordingly. But I'd say visibility is pretty limited at this point for the full year.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nRoss Seymore : Matt, I just wanted to ask about your business and perhaps a different way to split it. I think everybody is excited about the AI and the cloud is a part of it and for good reason. But if I took that out of the revenues, everything else seems to be down in your guidance, 30%, 35% year-over-year, somewhere in that range. I really just wanted to get what percentage of that, I think, is down just because of cyclicality, and it sounds like the first quarter might come down again, but should bounce back at some point versus the businesses you are just deprioritizing. So how much of a cyclical snapback whenever that happens, should we expect out of Marvell versus a focus away from some of those non-cloud areas?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Got you, Ross. Yes, I think maybe I'll start just super fast at the high level and we'll just dive in. I'd say that this sort of supply demand inventory cycle we've gone through in the industry has taken a lot longer than historical to play out. And its sort of the dynamic I would characterize this time is you had various end markets resetting and correcting at different times in a pretty protracted manner.  And if you go all the way back to last year in 2022, it started early with PCs and what the smartphones that went to gaming and then it started with data center and cloud, and it sort of had this kind of couple year series of resets, if you will. In our business, we saw these sort of declines in that manner as you talked about earlier this year in data center as an example. And a few quarters later, it's like roaring back as we work through some of those issues. So that's the cyclicality part you're talking about. And you're asking the right question, which is, hey, over time, do these come back or not because maybe we pulled R&D or we sort of have shifted our bets. So I'd say for our business, we are committed to a diversified portfolio. We invest R&D across those various segments, including enterprise carrier. And then within the cloud, there's a number of opportunities in AI. The only one that we really have deemphasized, and this goes back 5 or 6 years ago is consumer. And we've always projected in our models, in our Analyst Days that, that would be a declining business for us over time, both in revenue as a percent of total. But then our investments in the other areas would more than offset that. And that's proven to be the case. And so I think when you think about and model us going forward, we have R&D that's going in and will continue to be invested in kind of the core base of Marvell. And we've been able to grow that very nicely over time if you look at it on a trend line. It's really the consumer piece that is not going to come back. And just to give you an example, this year, one reason it did better is one of the programs we had, which has been in last time buy mode for several quarters. It actually outperformed during the year.  Now it looks like it's not going to continue into next year. But that business is probably in like the $50 million a quarter range type of thing, and that was a design we won years and years ago, and that's just not going to repeat as an example. It's not going to come back. And that's okay because that's not something we're putting R&D into.  But for the rest of the segments, we still take a long-term view that we can grow them at or above market and then, of course, take advantage of the cloud AI opportunity, which is really the big growth driver for Marvell. Hope that's helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. \nMatt Ramsay : Thank you very much Good afternoon, guys. Matt, I wanted to go back to some of the custom compute and ASIC programs and maybe ask a couple of questions about that. One is, I mean it's been a heck of a year from a gen AI perspective, when you just go back 12 months, we were just starting to hear ChatGPT then the whole thing has blown up. So the customer base all had to think about that, react to that.  And so I wanted to think about the programs that you have in flight and the interactions that you have with the customers and the limited set of customers in that space that are all going to be large. Have you seen them lean more into merchant, more into using ASIC houses or more into doing some of the silicon directly with the foundries themselves? There has been a change in that mix. That's the first part of the question.  The second part is when you look at AI overall, the leader in that space, which you guys announced a partnership with today, leads not just because of the silicon, but hugely because of software. And I was curious as to whether with the custom programs you're doing for AI compute, are you seeing the customers invest at the scale and software that can make those programs successful at volume over time?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I think it's -- you're right to kind of reflect that how much things have changed in basically a year. I think it's a pretty simple answer. On the first one, I'd say, every one of those different sort of segments, if you will, that you mentioned, all of them are up in terms of the activity. You can see it from the leaders' numbers and their guide, you can see it from some of the other companies in the ecosystem talking about ASIC and custom. I mean, look at where we've come from even on that, from having very kind of modest expectations to this being a significant revenue driver for us next year.  And then there's various business models, I think that all the large companies are trying to pursue to figure out how to, I think, do all of the above, which is kind of have a nice mix of custom for things that are very, very specific to them as well as take advantage of kind of the market unlock that's happening because of the work of, say, somebody like NVIDIA, right, that's actually helping to create a market. So I think all of that is going to be -- it's not a zero-sum game at all. And I'd say on the sort of customization side and working with those hyperscalers, the design activities through the roof at this point. And so a lot of excitement in that area, both for the custom and then all the stuff we can do around it from an optics and networking perspective. And then I'm not probably the best person to comment on the second one. But clearly, these are very, very well-capitalized smart companies. They understand their customers and they're going to do what they need to do for their workloads and for their custom silicon to make sure, I'm sure that the software and the service offerings are more than competitive, but you've got a great company that's also out there that's driving the market. So I think both are going to exist. And my last point would be to reiterate, this is clearly not like in traditional computing, where it's more of a zero-sum game. It's just highly hard to grow the pie. In fact, it may be hard to keep the pie even flat. In this area, there's going to be a lot of winners and there's going to be a lot of opportunity created for the companies that have the right positioning, customer relationship and IT portfolios to support these emerging needs. But it's very dynamic at this juncture. And I think for us, that's what creates a lot of opportunity.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks. Appreciate the perspective. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Please go ahead. \nAmbrish Srivastava : Hi, thank you very much. Matt, I had a question on gross margin. You surprised us negatively early in the year, and then you gave us good counsel, don't panic. And you're back at 64%. So just wanted to think through for the next year and what's the right way to think about the gross margin profile, given you have customer is coming in, but typically is lower margin than the corporate and maybe it's not for you guys, but what's the right year to think about the margin profile for the company near to medium term Matt? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: I'll let Will take a victory lap on this one. So, Willem go ahead.\nWillem Meintjes: Yes. Ambrish, so thanks for the question. So first of all, really pleased to be guiding back to 64% at the midpoint, right? I think the team internally has done a phenomenal job controlling what we can control in a pretty volatile environment. When we look at it to next year, we've been discussing some of the uncertainty on the recovery on some of our core businesses, right, enterprise networking and storage. And then also the timing and the scale of the ramp on custom. I'll just remind you, prior to this last year, we scaled our carrier and custom business is very significantly while maintaining our gross margin, right? And so looking ahead at next year, if custom on a relative basis grow significantly more, yes, clearly, that would put pressure on our gross margin. However, our view is that they'll be very accretive on operating margin and on EPS. So yes, so that's how we're looking at it. Hopefully, that's helpful, Ambrish.\nAmbrish Srivastava: It is. I had a quick clarification for you, Matt, sorry. You mentioned something about one to one pull attach rate for your business. I was just wondering what was it before. And kind of what has changed the -- what has changed in the dynamic to push it to greater than one to one? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. It's been a little bit of a journey on this topic. I think if you go back two quarters ago, we were still we were still building models out for how to think about the attach rate and help investors size the opportunity. And we ball parked it at one point one to one initially. And subsequent to that, as we sort of look at the kind of -- all of the optics through up into the switch and in the network.  And we've -- I think we've updated -- I think we were really reiterating this. We've updated this number before that it had grown to greater than 1. I think that was more of a clarification we were doing. But initially, it was a little bit of how do we actually get our hands around how big this could be and people wanted to know, balance that against how many GPUs they thought were going to shift. But I wouldn't say that's really incrementally new news. I think that was more of a reiteration, if you will, because it's not just the optics attaching from the accelerators to the switch, but also in between switch layers, and that was sort of the nuance that I think we needed to clarify. So that's the kind of rate on that one.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nHarlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. After 6 quarters of sequential shipment declines in nearline or capacity optimized HDDs by your customers, cloud and hyperscale excess inventory of drives appears to be normalizing. And then on top of that, you have cloud storage utilizations to keep on increasing. I think your storage customers are cautiously optimistic on sequential shipment improvements on their new 20 terabyte platforms. You guys are still shipping about half the rate of your pre-slowdown run rate on storage. I know you've been growing slightly sequentially the last few quarters. But are you guys starting to see signs of a sustainable pickup in data center stores moving into next year?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks. I think this is one of those markets, Harlan, where any good news is good news. I mean it's been very, very rough out there for that part of the electronics industry, and you certainly saw the impact on our revenues. Look, I'm encouraged to see the same reports of inventory coming down and some of the end customer commentary. We, I think, aren't going to call this until we really see the backlog build again. I mean it's come off the bottom and it's grown a little bit. And it's -- but even if it's sort of improving off the bottom, at least the end market side, it's still kind of flattish units, right? I don't think it's necessarily off to the races. So we're staying pretty cautious on this. We got hit pretty hard on the downside here, and we're going to cautiously kind of guide our way back into that market normalizing. But I will say the end market signs were hearing and seeing are positive, and it certainly gives us some hope for next year but we're not ready to call any kind of recovery in that area with any certainty or timing. But it has come off the bottom and it's continued to grow, which is a good thing.\nHarlan Sur: Appreciate the color. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Please go ahead. \nChristopher Rolland : Hey guys, thanks for the question. I'm kind of hearing mixed signals on the custom silicon opportunity. And I just wanted you guys to clarify on that. I guess, first of all, are you guys above or below $200 million expectation you guys had for the year? Second, are you expecting this to kind of double off of that $200 million or even $600 million originally that had been an $800 million number you had discussed. And then third, where are we on that $800 million long-term goal that you had? Is that like a 2025, 2026 opportunity? Or is it something beyond that?\nMatt Murphy: Got you. Yes, you're going back to the original like 2021 Investor Day, hey, here's kind of the custom silicon opportunity, which a couple of quarters back, we had reset to $200 million this year and then over time, getting to $800 million. I just want to clarify, that's what you're asking about?\nChristopher Rolland: Yes, that's right. I think that was in March. You guys talked about that $200 million for this year.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, exactly. So yes, so we're tracking, I'd say, close to the $200 million, okay, for this year. And then what we had said at the Investor Day and kind of the long term was this $800 million, and that was between, sometime between FY '25 and '26, that was what the -- if you looked at the slide from a couple of years back. And what we had said, I think 2 quarters back or it was a quarter back that, that number would be bigger over time now because of the AI piece of it, even though some of the stuff had shifted around that wasn't an AI.  And I think that's still largely on track in that time frame. We never gave an exact kind of -- it's going to happen in XYZ quarter. But in that FY '24, '25, FY '25, '26 time frame it should be able to get towards above that number we gave before which is the $800 million. So I don't think there's any mixed signals. I don't think there's any update, which I think we're -- I think there's some enthusiasm around, but nothing's changed from a quarter ago. In fact, I think the thing that's positive is that the chips are looking really good to go to production for next year, and that was always a risk.  Chris, if you remember in our commentary was, hey, these are extremely large die, very complex and a respin either by us or by our customer would -- could cause some delay. And so far, knock on wood, both these programs look like they're in good shape. The real issue is given the sort of growth that we've seen in gen AI. We just don't know the total magnitude, but it will be bigger than what we sized before. And I think we're largely tracking to what we thought was going to happen.\nChristopher Rolland: Thank you for that Matt. One last one on carrier. Is Q4 going to be the bottom? Or do you think there could be some more yet to drop? And then I think you have some additional content coming at one of your customers at the end of the year. Is that going to be a meaningful lift for the segment? Thanks. \nMatt Murphy: Yes. So there's -- as I think I said in my remarks, there's going to be continued softness into Q1 in carrier, okay? It's going to take, who knows how many quarters. And it really depends, I think, there'll be some inventory and then you've got to also look at kind of where the CapEx ends up during next year and where carriers are actually going to spend globally on their deployments.  But over time, there is a lift. There's a content lift we get from the additional sockets. And we still don't know kind of where -- let's go a couple of years out over the next couple of years where the market share is going to go as well relative to the sort of western suppliers versus the Chinese suppliers on a global basis. So there's a few factors in there that need to be considered. But yes, over time, sort of the number of base stations per year has been relatively well understood. Our content is going to be larger. And it's a solid business for us, I think that we built from a very kind of nascent position just a few years ago. But it will come back and it will have a little tailwind because of the content.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks so much, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Srini Pajjuri of Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Matt, I have a couple of clarifications at this point. First, on the custom silicon, understanding that it's a little bit early to size the opportunity. Given the complexity of these chips and the supply chain issues that we've been hearing about on the HBM and the CoLo [ph] side, I would think that the lead times from your customers are fairly long. So my question is, when do you expect to start building inventory, I guess, in terms of wafer inventory and packaging and et cetera. What time frame should we kind of expect that if you, I guess, are looking to ramp next year?\nMatt Murphy: Well, the planning certainly is happening now, Srini, to your point. And I think between ourselves, our supply chain partners, and our end customers who have a vested interest to make sure this all goes well. I think we've been working quite well as a kind of a team to make sure we've got the necessary capacity that's required from our wafers packaging and kind of third-party component perspective, including HBM. And yes, I mean, all of those are either capacity that's reserved or we're in the process of starting wafers. I mean again, there's multiple programs. So it's not sort of a -- each product is at a different point. But yes, I think the answer is, well -- and I think I was saying this even a quarter or 2 ago, we'll have a lot better visibility kind of come, call it, March when -- what this is going to look like because at that point, given lead times and all the other factors we'll just have much better visibility. So that's sort of the, I guess, the pro, if you will, of some of the complexity we're dealing with is you do have to plan in advance and you do have to start wafers. So all of that is kind of in motion.  I would say the capacity planning has been done some time ago. So we feel comfortable with where we are on that, even though it's tight. But yes, we're in that process, but I don't think we're going to get that granular on when exactly we're starting wafers, and we're just going to try to size the opportunity for investors when we have a better view in terms of what the revenue is, but the capacity side is looking to be in good shape for us.\nSrini Pajjuri: That makes sense. And then my other follow-up, Matt, on your Q1 guidance. And obviously, you said half of your business is going to be down. But I would have to imagine that the data center will continue to be healthy and strong, especially kind of what your customers are talking about in terms of AI investments continuing and also NVIDIA kind of sounded fairly positive about next year as well.  So my question is, given the strength that you saw in the last 2 quarters, I mean, are you concerned about any inventory build in your components? Or is that what's giving you pause about guiding for growth in the first quarter for the overall business? Because even if 50% of the business is down because looking at how much this business has grown in the last 2 quarters and if that trend continues, I would have to imagine that the total revenue should grow in Q1. So I'm just wondering what's giving you that pause looking for growth in Q1.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, yes. No, no problem. I'll maybe give you a little bit of a bad time here. I think we're trying to get to the Q4 call first. And then we could do the Q1 call, okay? So maybe first things first. So that being said, I mean, look, I think I would agree with the market commentary you gave, which is year-over-year, we do expect strong growth.  I'd say on our side, if you look at kind of the growth we've seen on AI, we're having a very, very strong fourth quarter. And some of that we're catching up from the upsides we had. I mean our supply chain team has done a phenomenal job, right? So I'd just say that we're not guiding Q1, it's dynamic at this point. And I need to really see where the orders flow in and what people really need. And right now, we're just focused on executing Q4. But yes, overall demand looks good. Overall growth next year should be good. But I think trying to guide 2 quarters now with this precision, Srini, is just not going to be helpful for anybody given how fast things are moving. So I'd prefer to give you my Q1 guide when we guide Q1.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Chris Caso of Wolfe.\nChris Caso : Yes, thank you. My question is on the cloud part of data center. It sounds like that was an area which may have surprised you a little bit coming back here. Can you talk about the driver of that? And to what extent -- to the extent you're seeing in kind of traditional cloud business is it cyclical or product cycle-driven?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, thanks. Our thesis earlier this year, which actually did play out, I think we had a lot of predictions and in some cases, the market didn't cooperate. But one area it did was that we did not believe that our traditional cloud business was going to be really impacted by the shift to AI. And in fact, it might even provide a tailwind. And our position was that, hey, because of our position in switching and in optics, that broader networking build was going to be required in data centers, in particular, multi-tenant data centers where you had to actually put in increased networking bandwidth to handle the AI capability that was being put in and that's played out. So I'd say there's been some on the product cycle in terms of new products kicking in at that time. But also, I'd just say that it's increased demand, increased demand for products, we added 400 gig and increased demand for our 12.8T switches, things that had been a little bit depressed earlier in the year with inventory correction. So that's been a real positive. It's kind of a nice combination of strong growth on the products we have as well as new products wrapping up -- ramping up, sorry. So yes, and that's played out, and that should be a nice driver and tailwind for us into next year as well. Chris.\nChris Caso: Got it. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: All right, fantastic. Hey, listen, I think we're pretty much at time. I'm going to conclude the call, maybe just a few words. First, I appreciate everybody's interest in the company. A couple of final comments would be despite kind of the challenging macro out there, I'm very, very pleased with the Marvell team and our performance. And I think what it shows is that even when you have a lot of volatility from a cyclical perspective in some of these end markets, right now, it's enterprise and carrier as an example, the diversified business model that we've really put together at Marvell has been able to have some strong offsets to those things. And like right now, we're seeing our data center business come roaring back with strong growth in the third quarter and then a very, very strong growth in the fourth quarter.  And that's the commitment we made several years ago. It was to diversify the company by end market, focus on data infrastructure, which, in our view, is going to be probably the best TAM growth opportunity in semis. And we still believe that and while we have some inventory digestion and end market weakness we're seeing in some segments that's going to revert over time in enterprise and carrier. And I would view that as, and describe that as kind of the core foundation of Marvell.  And then you have these nice growth drivers with large TAMs on top of it in cloud, in AI, in things like automotive that are going to drive our growth over time. So I think our model is working, and we're managing in a tough environment, and we're managing what we can control at this point. And with that, I will conclude the meeting. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect."

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's second fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO; and Willem Meintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance, let me highlight several new product announcements, starting with our electro-optics portfolio. First, we announced the release of Orion, the industry's first 800-gig coherent optical DSP for pluggable modules. Orion is our fifth generation of coherent DSPs and is produced in 5-nanometer technology incorporating our 112-gig SerDes, enabling 800-gigabits per second of throughput within the tight power and space constraints of small form factor pluggable optical modules. Orion enables high-performance probabilistic traffic shaping in addition to supporting standards-compliant transmission modes. We expect that Orion is well-positioned to continue to drive Marvell's leadership in coherent technology in both the carrier optical transport market as well as data center interconnects, or DCI, in the cloud market. In parallel with Orion, we launched the industry's first 800-gig DCI ZR module, our COLORZ 800 platform. We will be demonstrating our 800ZR module at the ECOC Conference in October. Marvell pioneered DCI technology at 100-gig, followed by a 400ZR platform, which has been shipping in volume since last year. COLORZ 800 will be our third generation of DCI modules. Powered by our new Orion DSP, COLORZ 800 incorporates Marvell's innovative silicon photonics technology, which integrates multiple discrete components on a single die. Marvell's 800ZR modules provide twice the bandwidth of current solutions while lowering power and cost per bit by 30%. Our 800ZR modules will enable the deployment of next-generation 51.2T switches and routers by cloud operators to support the massive increase in traffic between data centers, driven by continuing growth from Generative AI. Moving to our copper connectivity portfolio, we announced the industry's first 5-nanometer multi-gigabit PHY platform. This platform represents a significant leap in performance compared to products on the market today and is a key milestone in Marvell's journey to physical layer technology leadership. It is based on an innovative architecture that includes optimized circuit design, custom digital logic, and enhanced DSP algorithms. This PHY platform will deliver 10-gig performance at half the power of previous generation Marvell devices and will become the building blocks for multiple standalone PHY products, integrated SoCs, and custom ASICs optimized for specific markets and applications. We expect the adoption of multi-gig PHY will continue to grow in enterprise networking. In our automotive end market, we announced the industry's highest capacity automotive central Ethernet switch to support the zonal networking architectures of next-generation vehicles. This addition to our Brightlane family of auto Ethernet switches delivers 90-gigabits per second of bandwidth, nearly 2 times higher than current commercially available solutions. The new switch family also includes a combination of advanced security features not found together in any other automotive switch product. These features include MACsec link security on every port, deep packet inspection for heightened intrusion detection, and an embedded hardware security module for encryption. This product has started sampling to multiple leading automotive customers and partners. Let me now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the quarter. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Marvell team continued to execute, delivering revenue of $1.34 billion. These results were above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily driven by demand from AI applications growing faster than our prior forecast. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were better than guidance due to an acceleration of the cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter. As a result, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.33, $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. We are pleased with our performance for the quarter in a challenging macro environment. Let me now move on to reviewing our results and expectations by end market, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $460 million, growing 6% sequentially, well above our guidance for a flat outlook. We were able to outperform our guidance in this end market because of accelerating demand for optical products to meet the continuing expansion of cloud AI deployments. Our overall revenue from cloud grew over 20% sequentially. Notably, revenue from both cloud AI and standard cloud infrastructure grew sequentially, with AI growing faster. As expected, revenue from the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market declined significantly on a sequential basis in the second quarter, reflecting a weakening enterprise market. As you heard in detail last quarter, AI infrastructure requires a staggering amount of high-bandwidth connectivity, best provided by an optically connected infrastructure operating at the highest available speeds. Marvell is enabling AI with a broad range of solutions, which include: PAM4-based optical DSPs and AECs for connecting accelerator clusters inside AI data centers; DCI products for connectivity between regional data centers; low-latency high-capacity Ethernet switches for fabric connectivity inside data centers; and custom silicon for compute acceleration. We are confident that the breadth of Marvell's technology positions us as one of a scarce few semiconductor companies that can enable the industry to capitalize on the rapid growth in AI. Marvell's market-leading PAM4 optical DSPs are indispensable for the pluggable optical module ecosystem that cloud customers rely upon to build their massively scalable networks. Our DSPs enable full interoperability and backward and forward compatibility. They also provide the advanced telemetry and diagnostics, critical to maintaining an extremely resilient and serviceable network. We've been shipping the industry's highest-speed 800-gig PAM4 DSPs in high volume for several quarters and have begun sampling our next-generation 1.6T platform. We're seeing demand for connectivity between regional data centers accelerate as inference is deployed across multiple locations. As Ashish told you, Marvell has been a key enabler of this application with our DCI products, and we just announced our plan to demonstrate the industry's first 800ZR modules in October based on our new Orion coherent DSP. Looking at the future of optical connectivity, we are uniquely positioned in the industry with a leadership position in both PAM and coherent technology. We are also excited about the opportunity for our next generation of Ethernet switches, our 51.2T Teralynx 10 platform, which we announced earlier this year. We have begun sampling this product and we are seeing strong interest from customers. Last quarter, we told you how cloud customers are enhancing their AI offerings by building custom accelerators of their own. Trend is leading to a larger and faster-growing opportunity for Marvell's custom compute portfolio. We have won a number of custom silicon programs tied to AI and these are well underway to start ramping into volume production next year. Let me now talk about what we're seeing in storage in data center. As we expected, from a low base in the first quarter, we saw sequential storage data center revenue growth in the second quarter, and we are expecting modest sequential growth in the third quarter. However, storage end market demand remains significantly depressed and customer inventory remains high. As a result, the industry's expectations for a data center storage recovery have pushed out meaningfully. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth from overall cloud to accelerate above last quarter's performance, driven by continued strong growth from cloud AI, as well as standard cloud infrastructure. Demand for our AI products continues to grow at an extraordinary rate and we are working very closely with our customers to meet the rapidly evolving needs. On the other hand, enterprise on-premise is expected to continue to trend down. As a result, we are projecting overall data center revenue in the third quarter to grow in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the second quarter was in line with our guidance at $276 million, declining 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Sequential and year-over-year decline were driven entirely by the wired portion of our carrier end market, reflecting ongoing demand weakness and inventory digestion at wired customers. In contrast, our wireless revenue continued to grow in the second quarter, building upon the 25% sequential growth we saw in the first quarter, and we are expecting additional growth in the third quarter. As a result of significant share and content gains for Marvell products in conjunction with the 5G upgrade cycle, we have grown our wireless revenue significantly over a multiyear period. While the full conversion to 5G in the world's installed base of wireless infrastructure will take many years, a number of regions are completing their initial phase of 5G deployments and are taking a pause in a challenging macroeconomic environment before they upgrade the balance of their networks. As a result, following an extended period of strong growth, we are expecting a significant sequential reduction in our wireless revenue in the fourth quarter. However, we expect that once customer and operator inventories normalize and carrier CapEx returns to more healthy levels, we can resume growth in our overall carrier end market and start to realize additional share gains. These will come from 5-nanometer base station designs we have won, but which are not yet in production. In addition, we expect the launch of our next-generation 800-gig Orion coherent DSP platform will drive long-term growth from the wired optical transport market. Moving to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to grow in the low-single-digit sequentially on a percentage basis driven by wireless. Turning to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $328 million, declining 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As we have been signaling for the last few quarters, we continue to see inventory corrections impact customer demand in this end market. We expect this inventory re-normalization to take a few quarters to resolve as customer balance sheets get worked down over time. While we deal with these market dynamics in the near term, I would note that enterprise networking has been an important contributor to Marvell's successful transformation to a leader in data infrastructure. The Marvell team has driven an extended multi-year period of exceptional revenue growth, with enterprise networking revenue essentially doubling over the last few years. This was enabled by a significant share in content gains, a testament to the consistent investment we've made in refreshing our enterprise networking product portfolio. As Ashish told you, we continue to introduce new products such as the industry's first 5-nanometer multi-gig Ethernet PHY transceiver. Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we project our enterprise networking revenue to decline in the low teens sequentially on a percentage basis due to the market dynamics outlined earlier. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue in the second quarter was $110 million above guidance, growing 32% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was led by our automotive business, which continued to benefit from the growing adoption of Ethernet in cars. We also closed on a number of new automotive Ethernet design wins with multiple top 10 automotive OEMs during the quarter. Looking to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we project revenue from our auto and industrial end market to be flattish sequentially and to continue growing year-over-year in the 30% range. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the second quarter was $168 million, growing 2% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Revenue was below guidance as deliveries for an end-of-life program were rescheduled to the third quarter. As a result, we are forecasting consumer end-market revenue to grow sequentially in the low teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter. In summary, we delivered revenue and earnings above the midpoint of guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We are forecasting revenue growth to accelerate in the third quarter, accompanied by gross margin expansion. We intend to remain disciplined on operating expenses to help us deliver strong operating leverage. Looking ahead, while inventory digestion in some end markets is taking longer to resolve, demand from AI applications continues to strengthen and Marvell is well-positioned to benefit from that trend. Based on our latest demand outlook for our electro-optics products, we now expect revenue from AI to exit this year at over a $200 million quarterly revenue run rate or $800 million annualized. This is well above what we had outlined last quarter. Put this in perspective, this would put us at the run rate we had previously communicated for all of next year. Looking forward between the ongoing strength from electro-optics and the expected ramp of multiple custom compute programs, we are expecting continued outsized growth from AI. Our results and outlook continue to validate our strategy to focus on developing the most advanced silicon for data infrastructure. The diversification in our end markets is serving us well, with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through the softening macro environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.341 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, declining 12% year-over-year and growing 1% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market, driving 34% of total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest end market with 24% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 21%, consumer at 13%, and auto/industrial at 8%. GAAP gross margin was 38.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, growing 30 basis points sequentially, driven by cost improvements, partially offset by a weaker revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect gross margins to continue to improve in the third quarter and then to increase significantly in the fourth quarter. As Matt told you, the recovery in storage continues to push out, which is negatively impacting our product mix. However, in the fourth quarter, we project a significant improvement in our overall product mix to lead to stronger gross margin. We expect this improvement will be driven by our continuing growth in data center, while wireless carrier and consumer revenue declines on a relative basis. In addition, the Marvell team continues to execute well on our efforts to reduce costs. As a result, we continue to target non-GAAP gross margin returning to the bottom end of our long-term model of 64% to 66% in the fourth quarter. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $727 million, including share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and acquired -- and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, $7 million below guidance. We are pleased to report that we accelerated our cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter. We remain on track to execute the remainder of our cost reduction plan by the end of this fiscal year, as we communicated last quarter. Moving on to the rest of the income statement. GAAP operating margin was negative 15.7%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9%. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.24. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.33, $0.01 above the midpoint of guidance. Now, turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $113 million. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in DSO as well as severance-related cash restructuring charges. Our DSO increased [13] (ph) days from the prior quarter, primarily due to worse linearity as we ramp shipments on orders that were received well within lead time. CapEx was $111 million, which included a large number of leading node tape-outs that we expect to drive our future growth. As a reminder, our CapEx can be lumpy in any given quarter. We expect CapEx on average to be approximately mid-single-digits of revenue on a percentage basis. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $1.02 billion, decreasing by $10 million sequentially. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends. Our total debt was $4.15 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.04 times, and net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.83 times. During the quarter, we paid down $500 million of our total debt. Looking ahead, we will opportunistically explore accessing the debt capital markets to refinance our upcoming debt maturities. As of the end of the second fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $423 million. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 45.6% to 48%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 60.3% to 61.3%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $666 million to $671 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $435 million to $440 million. We expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt, to be approximately $48 million. For the third quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted-average shares outstanding to be 863 million and our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding to be 869 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in a range of a loss of $0.02 to $0.12 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. In summary, for the third quarter, we are guiding for solid sequential revenue growth, further expansion in non-GAAP gross margin, and additional reductions in non-GAAP OpEx, all of which positions Marvell for strong operating leverage and earnings growth. In addition, following the paydown of $500 million in debt in the second quarter, we resumed buybacks in the third quarter. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Matt, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the storage business. I am just trying to understand all the dynamics there. So, it sounds like there is a delay in the recovery, obviously, because there's still some inventories out there. But I'm also trying to understand the growth in storage associated with AI. I know these are different architectures, right? But if you could give us any more color on the digestion of the inventory on the compute side, coupled with how storage could benefit more on the AI side?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, sure. Hey, thanks, Tore, for the question. Yeah, on storage, I would say the best guide post is to look at the end customer commentary and both what the hard drive companies are saying as well as the flash industry, and just relative to the sort of extended time it's taking for inventory to work down at their level. That being said, eventually, it's going to come back. It's a little bit longer than we had modeled, but at this point, we're following the market and following our customers, and hopefully that's sometime at the beginning of next year, in the first half, but we'll see how that goes. But eventually, it will come back. On the AI question, it's kind of interesting. We continue to make attempts to model that. We don't have a great model for storage at this point. We've got I think an excellent view now of where we sit in the block diagrams relative to our optical products, our custom silicon, networking, but the storage impact, in our view, at a high level is net positive, but we don't have a particularly helpful model to how to think about that. Certainly, AI should be an overall tailwind for storage. But I think there is -- that's all caught up in the inventory that's being worked out at the CSPs.\nTore Svanberg: Sounds good. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Matt, so AI revenue was supposed to be I think $400 million this year, it's actually going to exit at $200 million a quarter. So, it's going to -- it's, obviously, going to be higher than $400 million for the year. Can you talk about how much of whatever the number will be for the year? Probably $500 million or $550 million something like that I would think. How much of that is going to be custom ASIC? And then next year, you said that AI would be greater than $800 million. Obviously, it's going to be quite a bit greater than $800 million. Can you maybe update that number and give us an idea of how much of that's going to be custom ASIC? I'm guessing $150 million, something like that, but I'm wondering if you can give us some more milepost there. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Tim. Yes. So I think, very encouraged by the demand trajectory upwards on the AI segment for us. Exiting the year at $200 million run rate, that is still mostly driven by the electro-optics platform, the DSPs, TIAs, and drivers at 800-gig. There is probably going to be a little contribution even in the fourth quarter from custom silicon. But that really ramps up more meaningfully next year. But we look at this as just a very positive sign that a quarter ago when we did our -- made our best estimates as to the opportunity in front of us, the fact that exiting the year will be at next year's run rate is very positive. So think of it as this year mostly electro-optics, that's going grow again next year, obviously. And then you need to layer on top a more meaningful ramp in custom silicon. But at this point, demand is so far up into the right, it's actually hard for us to put an exact number or give you a refined number on next year, other than it's going to be obviously bigger than we said the last time around.\nTimothy Arcuri: Right. I guess, just -- but is the -- so there's obviously this big surge happening during the back half of the year. But if you took the AI piece, does it continue at that sort of linear rates through the year, or does it sort of flatten off as you kind of go out through next year? Just trying to shape that. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. I think it's -- well, I think the way you should think about it is, in Q4, we're already at $200 million. It's going to be at a higher run rate throughout fiscal '25 each quarter. So, it's going to keep growing on the optics side, and then you're going to layer in custom silicon on top. So, we're not -- we're certainly not saying it's going to flatline at that level. We're just saying it's coming a lot faster, demand has been a lot better, supply chain team in Marvell is doing a great job to source the components and the capability that we need. So, I think it's a great setup for next year relative to the AI revenue.\nTimothy Arcuri: Great, Matt. Thank you so much.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. I wanted to ask, it's either Matt or Willem, I guess, on the gross margin. Can you just remind us what the headwinds are that you expect to resolve in Q4? Because I guess storage is taking longer, but I think the gross margin in electro-optics are quite good, so you would think that would be a tailwind. So, could you just walk us through the puts and takes on the gross margin guide, that would be helpful.\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, thanks, Blayne. Yes, certainly the optics is a tailwind. And then in addition to that, we've signaled that wireless carrier is really stepping down in the fourth quarter and consumer is also really stepping down. So, the combination of those things. And then in addition, our cost structure for our products is really improved. And the overhead on manufacturing and we see that benefit, it's really starting to flow through more significantly in the fourth quarter. So, storage certainly is a headwind for us as that recovery is pushed out.\nBlayne Curtis: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Yeah, thank you very much, guys. Good afternoon. Matt, I think you addressed the AI revenue commentary. I wanted to ask about the sort of goalpost for custom silicon. We had been in -- we've had that conversation around $400 million and then $800 million and then it got pushed out a little bit. And there has been I mean -- I don't think any of us have seen anything like the CapEx shifts that have happened around Generative AI and spending patterns at a lot of your large customers. What we've observed is, a lot of custom compute ASIC programs in flight, some of them are for sort of CPU offload and whether it's called DPU or SmartNIC or whatever you want to call it, some of them are for smaller model inference custom silicon programs at hyperscale. Maybe you could talk a little bit about where your engagements are? What you're seeing in terms of timing and magnitude? Because it's been such a tumultuous CapEx environment with AI versus traditional compute. And if you have any updates on some of those numbers around the custom compute programs and timing, that would be really helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, great. Thanks for the question. I'd say a couple of things, Matt. The first is on your question about the custom silicon opportunity, which really if you sort of summarize the different pieces of it as you mentioned, it's really of all to provide accelerated computing, right, in a custom format for these various companies. I think the overall CapEx shift towards accelerated computing is clearly going to benefit those that are participating in that segment, including us. And we do see -- and some of that overlapped, and that's why last quarter we tried to decouple them somewhat. But some of that revenue obviously overlaps with the AI numbers I gave earlier. But it's certainly a positive setup. We talked about having two different products last quarter that were kind of the lead ones that were tied to AI. One of which was in sample stage. That product is looking very good and most likely go into production first pass. The second product taped out as we expected in the second quarter, and that's also planned to ramp up next year. The size and the timing of those are still to be determined. We're working with our customers on those. But the overall shift in CapEx spending is clearly a tailwind on that business. So I'd sort of say to calibrate it today kind of tracking towards what we updated you guys on the last time, and then next year, it really depends on how much it moves over, Matt, and how much it can actually -- how much business can be driven. So, we're not calling that, other than to say it's -- the custom stuff for us is mostly going to be driven by AI next year in terms of the...\nMatt Ramsay: Got it. No, thank you, Matt. Appreciate it.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah, hey. I think when you talked about gross margin drivers for fourth quarter, Matt, you mentioned that you might be expecting a significant recovery in revenues as well. Did I, a, understand that correctly? And if so, could you talk about what might be happening in the fourth quarter to drive that recovery?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. You're saying overall, Harsh?\nHarsh Kumar: Yes.\nMatt Murphy: Your question is, what's sort of the view? Yeah, obviously, we're guiding one quarter at a time, but to give you some perspective because we gave you a lots of puts and takes including commentary about carrier and wireless, which we've been actually saying for several quarters now relative to that, 5G run taking a pause. Overall, we expect revenues to be up again in the fourth quarter. We were sort of consistent with what we outlined in last quarter's call, which is that Q3 and Q4 growth would accelerate. So kind of think of that as -- growing again in the fourth quarter sort of like we did in Q3. But really driven by cloud and AI, and AI being the big driver. But also as we said in our prepared remarks, standard cloud infrastructure revenues are also growing very nicely through the year, not only from Q2 -- Q1 to Q2 and Q2 to Q3, but also into the fourth quarter and beyond. And that means if you kind of do the back of the envelope, data center becomes a bigger part of our revenue and AI becomes a bigger part of our revenue by the fourth quarter. And then overall Marvell, Inc. is also up. So, I just kind of frame it at a high level, we did set out a long time ago to have a diversified strategy within data infrastructure by serving multiple end markets with a suite of products. So, we've got enterprise, 5G, automotive, data center. And as you've seen even in this dynamic environment, certain quarters some are performing better than others, and then we're sort of blessed to have markets that then have kicked in at the right time. So, even in a tough macro right now, Marvell is continuing to grow throughout the year starting from our first quarter, and we anticipate that growth obviously going through Q3 and then through Q4. But the mix shifting by end market, if that makes sense. I know you will create your model and -- we give enough commentary I think to put the pieces together.\nHarsh Kumar: No, we appreciate it, Matt. Thank you so much.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey, thanks for the question. And this one is for Matt. Just kind of an amazing revision here on the electro-optics portion. Since you've seen this inflection, you probably done some more research here, how are you thinking about the attach rate for these products per GPU, call it, is it one for one? Are you thinking it could be two for one? I've seen some research that suggests depending on how many layers there are, could even be three per one. And is the revenue that we're talking about here, all 800-gig PAM4 DSPs? Is there anything else related in that as well? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, I think it's fairly similar to our view last quarter. We were pretty clear about the direct attach, which was the one-to-one you mentioned. Understanding that as you get to the upper layers of the network, there is more, and there is a range and you probably size the range. We're still I think refining our exact models there, so I don't know if I have an exact number to give you. But I think you're thinking about it the right way, starting at the direct attach and then building higher. And the second part of your question, it's all 800-gig for AI, at this point. We have strong traction on our next-generation products at 1.6T, which would be starting sometime next year. The products that are at frequencies lower than 800 gigabits are typically served for the traditional cloud infrastructure, which is also seeing a recovery as well. So, hopefully that's helpful.\nChristopher Rolland: Fantastic. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. I don't know if this one is for Matt or Willem. But I just wanted to talk about the puts and takes to next year's gross margin, and I know you're not guiding that far out with any specifics. But it seems like you're going to have a number of custom products that will be going up in the data center side, the storage side should recover at some point in time. But the general question is if custom products tend to be lower gross margin and storage and some other areas like enterprise eventually come back cyclically, how do we think about the puts and takes in your gross margin versus that 64% to 66% historical target range?\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, Ross, maybe I can start and Matt can add. So, when you look back, certainly over the last couple of years, we've grown both our carrier and ASIC business sort of faster than the rest of the business. And we were able to maintain our gross margin within our target range. We're targeting to get back to that 64% exiting this year and then to maintain that through next year. But clearly, it's sort of early to decide exactly how big the ASIC ramp is next year. Now if we do show outsized growth there, that would negatively impact our gross margin, but certainly our view is that, that would be very accretive to operating income and to EPS. But it's too early right now to know exactly the extent of that. Hopefully, that's helpful, Ross.\nMatt Murphy: And Ross, maybe -- it's Matt, I'll just add. I think the -- clearly, the custom business carries a lower gross margin, we've been very open about that. But I think looking out to next year, it's a little early to call it, right? We don't know the rate of recovery for storage, that's a big part of the equation. We also have what's the -- even within like AI and cloud, what's the optics revenue going to be versus the custom stuff. You've got automotive continuing to perform well and growing, which is a higher-than-average gross margin category for us. So, we've got a lot of irons in the fire relative to various businesses that may or may not pick up at different times. As Willem said, we had a pretty consistent ability to manage gross margins in the range that we were targeting, understanding there is mix issues all the time. We've been going through a period here Q1, Q2, and Q3, where we've had it for a longer period, I'd say, unfavorable gross margin relative to our traditional mix. But it's such a dynamic environment, it's really hard to call the ball exactly, Ross, on when all those markets sort of burn through inventory, kickback back in, what is the recovery look like. But when we look at it a very high level, we continue to believe we have a very nice balanced portfolio of different products, technologies with different business models behind them that generate different gross and operating margin profiles. And as an example, like Willem said just because some of these custom programs are at lower than corporate average gross margin, especially if they ramp significantly, they are extremely accretive to operating margin and operating income at the bottom line level, which ultimately over time is what we're laser-focused on is driving earnings per share and driving operating profits for the company. So, high-level answer, but maybe it just frames it up, we need a little more time in front of us to really figure out what that looks like for next year.\nRoss Seymore: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Matt, I was hoping you could help us size how big storage is. Currently, in the quarter you reported both kind of data center and outside of data center. And I forgot whether you mentioned whether that's going to be up/down/flat in Q3 and Q4, or can it kind of hold at these low levels? And what are you looking for to inform you as to when it starts to grow sequentially, like how much excess inventory is out there, or do you think that it can actually hold at these low levels? So, just help us kind of set what the right baseline view is of storage as you get into next year.\nMatt Murphy: Sure, thanks, Vivek. It's a great question, okay, I think it's in some ways a million-dollar question. Let me tell you where we're at so far. So, obviously, Q1 was very, very low in terms of our storage revenues, and in particular, we're really talking about data center storage, if you think about it. The consumer piece is kind of hung in there because of some the specific applications we have. But that's -- what's moving the needle is the data center side. In Q2, it had recovered, which was nice to see. It was coming off a bottom, right around $100 million, let's call it, something like that. And then, from there, we said in our prepared remarks, Q3 we'd see a modest recovery again. So that would be up. It's still not sloping towards I think where we thought it was going to be a quarter or two ago relative to the year-end exit rate, and I think most of the end customer commentary suggests this is more of a first half of '24 type of recovery. But I guess the good news is, it's come off the bottom, good growth in Q2, it's going to grow again in Q3, and it will grow again in Q4. But it's just not quite at that slope and that rate. When we've dug in with the customer base kind of all the way to the end companies that consume the storage, it's hard to get an exact clear picture of where the inventory is and the timing, as I mentioned. However, what we do understand is that there's a lot of activity on qualifying the next-generation drives in technologies. There's a big TCO benefit. We haven't been able to detect anything structurally that's changed per se, although we continue to study that. So, in our mind, it looks like this has to come back to where it was at some point in terms of the number of exabytes that are being shipped or consumed, and it should grow from there for all the reasons that's been growing for the last 20 years. And AI, there was a question earlier about that, it's probably a tailwind on that. But I think with how far back we are on the supply chain, I'll just conclude my remarks by saying it's just very difficult to get a full read on where it all is, what's going on at the end customer level, and when it comes back. So, all we can do is sort of look at what our customers are saying and talking to us about and follow their lead. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nVivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, Matt. My question is on the custom silicon side, I think you called out two programs that -- in AI that you expect to ramp next year. Can you talk about the design win pipeline? And also I want -- if you could touch on, I know it's difficult to predict what kind of revenue opportunity -- forecast the revenue opportunity this early, but could you give us at least some sense, because some of these programs -- we do hear that some of these programs do get canceled. So, just want to make sure that you have that visibility that these programs are for real, what you have for next year. And then, if you can talk about other opportunities beyond those two programs that you talked about, that will be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, great question. Let me start with the, are they real, because I think that was the big question. Probably two quarters back, Srini, and even at the end of last year when I think the reality of the macroeconomy really hit the cloud companies pretty significantly and that's when you saw those companies at a very high level take actions on headcount, take actions on expenses, look at program priorities down at the infrastructure level. And part of our call in Q1 and Q2 was sort of advising investors how that had changed. What emerged from that was a shift from traditional cloud infrastructure to AI, now we've seen that play out through the first half of the year. So, those programs not only are getting funded there, there is extreme urgency around them. And so, now we're at a point given where these products are at, actually talking about when do we start wafers, how do we make sure the capacity is lined up, how do we have three-way calls to make sure we're all dialed-in on what's needed. So, that gives us quite a bit of comfort, and that -- and we were further along. In a quarter from now, two quarters from now, we'll be even farther along relative to being able to provide more visibility on what that ramp looks like. But we feel good about that. And certainly going through that process, we -- for all the programs in the pipeline, we have both one an open a good view of where our customers want to go. On the opportunity size, just to give you a sense, if you look at the overall Marvell's total design opportunity pipeline, the biggest segment is data center, it wouldn't surprise you, but it's a huge portion of our open funnel. And of that, we look at it every quarter the AI portion just continues to grow and has become very significant from an opportunity standpoint. And what I would say is, it's really a combination of all the technologies I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's the PAM products going from 800 gig to 1.60T, it's our AEC offerings, it's the big custom compute silicon programs that are out there and there's a tremendous urgency to increase the beat rate on those and get them out faster. Significant interest in our Ethernet switching platform at 51.2T. Not only that, the roadmap beyond that. We have a number of new exciting technologies too like bringing silicon photonics inside the data center. So, when you think about the conversations we're having, it's just a number of technologies that really work well together. And I think customers are engaging with us now to figure out how they can get the best out of Marvell overall and really differentiate themselves within their data center architectures, on TCO, on power, on performance and using the suite of technologies and really optimizing for their architecture. So I'd say there's a number of sockets, the pipeline is big, those are all the catch-all, that sounds great. But I'd say the more strategic and interesting piece and that's where I'm spending time is really making sure we marshal the resources of Marvell to engage very deeply at the highest levels with our big cloud customers and partners in the ecosystem and present ourselves as one company with a suite of solutions that can process the data, it can move the data, it can store the data, and it can even secure the data inside your cloud. And I think all of those together is very exciting. So, yes, we'll see, lots of opportunity in front of us.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I know there's been a lot of focus on your electro-optical business tied to AI. But I think the bigger portion of your electro-optical business is focused on the persistent upgrade cycles across the entire cloud data center footprint, right? And I think these tailwinds are still in front of the team, right? I think you still have -- there still is one more cloud titan that is yet to upgrade to 400-gig across its data center. You still have the 800-gig 1.6T optical upgrade across the remaining three titans. And then on DCI, you're still ramping 400ZR DCI, but you still I think have two more cloud customers that are in the pipeline. So, are these broad upgrade cycles starting to line up to fire next year, maybe even some starting in the second half of this year, maybe it ties into some of your commentary on strength in broader cloud. But just trying to get a sense of the ramp profile on these upgrade cycles.\nMatt Murphy: I think you did a great job summarizing it. The AI piece has obviously become very meaningful and we gave a sense of what that level of revenue is going to be in the fourth quarter. So it's pretty amazing how fast that's grown obviously. But to your point, the standard cloud infrastructure side of connectivity is having a nice recovery off of some inventory that was built last year, that's now becoming a tailwind as that burns down. You pointed out that there's still a major cloud company to go through their upgrades. So that's also in front of us. As we transition each of the technologies, in terms of speed, there is always an ASP bump and it makes sense, because you're delivering, 2x bandwidth for not 2x the price, right? So, we're on a nice sort of share the benefits with our customer trajectory there. And even at 1.6T for next year while AI will lead it, right behind it, it's going to be a key part of the overall infrastructure build probably the year after. And then the regional data center stuff, which is really the ZR products, also just doing extremely well this year. I mean large upsides due to Generative AI. And then, we said in the prepared remarks and we just put out the press release, I think it was today or it was yesterday about 800ZR, and there'll be more to come on that. But there is another frequency kicker coming in probably faster than we would have thought if you went back six or nine months ago because that between data center bandwidth is actually now becoming a bottleneck. So just tremendous across-the-board opportunities that are not just AI, but it's really driving our cloud growth, and that's -- a lot of that we're seeing in the second half and we're going to see it through next year. So, we have both of those irons in the fire for Marvell overall growth.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. Willem, I had a question on the cash flow side. I was trying to see if there was a discernible pattern of seasonality, doesn't seem to be. But you gave a reason for DSOs and impacting the (CFO] (ph). Could you kind of just walk us through how should we think about cash flow for the rest of the year?\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Ambrish. Yes, so this quarter certainly DSO was impacted somewhat by linearity. We do expect a nice back -- bounce-back in Q3 and some normalization. As we've mentioned, we're really focused on driving down our days of inventory and we've consistently reduced that through this year, and we expect to continue driving that down through the rest of this year. And so, yes, you should expect some good improvement in the second half here.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Okay. And my quick question for you, Matt. We're hearing a lot of companies are talking about the pushouts of CapEx, general-purpose CPU towards AI. I know you addressed it in some ways earlier. But are you seeing that manifest in your business that certain projects are being sacrificed at the AI alter?\nMatt Murphy: Funny way to phrase it. Yes, I think there's two aspects. I think one is, were there project reprioritization or not within those companies. And then also, is it affecting our business right now, which is kind of the two pieces. So, our view is, on the first one, at least for Marvell, I can't comment about everybody, but for us, we really worked through that issue at the end of last year, early this year. There was a big, I'd say kind of re-prioritization that went on, first, driven by the budget squeeze and companies just trying to get more efficient. And then almost in line with that was sort of the release of ChatGPT and the realization that there was this potential massive opportunity, right, for productivity gains through AI and then what are people going to do and then sort of the race was on. So, from that standpoint, we feel very good about our WIP and what we're working on and that -- at least for us, those decisions and re-prioritizations were made. And some of those are why we were lighter on our custom silicon revenue this year. We sort of talked about that a couple of quarters ago. So those programs got delayed. So, we've I guess taken some medicine on that and we moved past it, now we've got this off to the races with the AI stuff. And then, on our current business as you saw, we had -- in Q2, we had overall data center revenues up pretty nicely and that included on-prem being down, AI being up a lot, but we also said that standard cloud infrastructure was up and it's going to be up again nicely in the third quarter and it's going to continue through the fourth quarter into next year. So, I think we've worked through that as well. And probably the reason we don't get hit quite as much there is that we're tied more to the networking and connectivity than selling CPUs as an example. And so, that overall kind of network bandwidth needs to continue to get upgraded and deal with it, because a lot of these big data centers are multi-tenant and they've got AI sitting in there, and they've got specialty built servers and storage for other things, but it all needs to work together and it all needs to ultimately have the right level of bandwidth to support the compute power. So those are some puts and takes. I think the headwind on the whole thing would -- for us really would be the storage piece, which shows up in our data center near-line and that we've just been kind of -- I answered the questions about that already. So that's the puts and takes, but overall it's actually growing very nicely for us. It will be a growth driver for us next year too.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. I guess the question is digging into the enterprise on-premise a little bit more. If you give some detail on what you include in that, that's still looking to be down, does that include, for example, fiber channel as well? And do you think that business -- that this will mark a bottom to that business? Yeah, obviously, probably difficult to figure out when that starts getting better.\nMatt Murphy: Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, it's -- enterprise on-premise business has just kept coming down. Now I think the reality is if you look at overall enterprise server shipments and you look at sort of the end data, that's probably been down for, I don't know, eight quarters or something. So, the end markets just not doing as well. It's mostly fiber channel that's within there. There's also some Ethernet and some NIC products as well. I don't know that we're necessarily calling a bottom, but it's got to be close just because at some point, people need to -- people actually need to buy servers and customers need to work through inventory. So, it's been a headwind. I think we're close to it, maybe needs a little more time, maybe another quarter. But at some point, that will renormalize as well. And it's obviously within overall data center, all of that sort of inventory adjustment and weakness at the end market levels being just blown away, obviously, by the AI and cloud infrastructure piece, which is still driving very healthy growth into Q3 and then another step-up obviously in Q4. And that's assuming really no material recovery in the on-prem side. But I do expect over time, if you just sort of step back and look at like fiber channel, it's been a pretty stable business for us, ever since we've owned it through the Cavium acquisition. And we don't see any reason why, at some point, that just doesn't come back to where it was. And when it does that, that will also be a positive thing for us. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nChris Caso: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, Matt, I wanted to ask, you talked about the electro-optics driving most of that $200 million of AI revenue. Can you give us some sense how much of that is InfiniBand versus Ethernet within those 800-gig modules? And do you guys see any share difference between your position in Ethernet versus InfiniBand? I know your share is very high in general in that market, but just wondering if you would say your share is higher either in the Ethernet or InfiniBand. And then I got a follow-up.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, maybe the simple answer is, first of all, as you point out, we're agnostic. We participate broadly in the connectivity independent of whether it's InfiniBand or Ethernet. And I'd say that we continue to have very high market share and penetration into both those applications. And the demand we're seeing is broad-based from both of those as well as multiple customers driving it. So, it's actually really kind of hard to break it down exactly. And I don't know that it's super helpful, because overall, the shares still very healthy, and we're agnostic. So, the same module can kind of be used in either one.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Okay. So it's pretty broad-based across both. The follow-up question is just you mentioned 51.2 terabit switch and starting to sample. Just as you look out to calendar '24, fiscal '25, do you see that starting to get deployed at the U.S. hyperscaler partners?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, I think we'll have some contribution from that product area next year. The bigger ramp is a little bit further out. But very pleased, I'd say, with the open funnel on that technology. I'm very happy with the team. I mean this -- the architecture and the key pieces of that initially came from Innovium, right, which is a company we acquired in 2021. But the thing that we did upfront is we put it on the Marvell 5-nanometer design flow using our SerDes, our IP platform, our new product development process. So you kind of got the best of both worlds and teams executed extremely well on the chip. And as a result, it's giving customers confidence we can really be there for them not only on the feature set, including very, very low latency and in the right power envelope, but also being able to manufacture for high volume, which is no small task on these effectively reticle buster type switches or type products. So we'll see how it goes, Quinn, but pipeline is strong. This is going to be a big upgrade cycle for the industry. And I think it's going to be overall positive for the people that are in that ecosystem.\nQuinn Bolton: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: I think we'll do one -- perfect, Quinn. And I think we'll do, Gary, one more question, and then we can wrap it.\nOperator: And that question will be from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I don't think there's been a mention so far the influence on an extra week in the fourth quarter. Matt, I want to verify your expectation of sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Is that independent of the extra week or inclusive of the extra week? And Willem, the target of OpEx for the fourth quarter, I think you said $430 million with the extra week. Is that still the target?\nWillem Meintjes: That's correct.\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Willem, you want to go? Then, I'll go.\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, sure. Yeah, just on the OpEx, that's correct, Gary. So for the 13 weeks normalized, we said $420 million. And so, for the full 14 weeks, we guided $430 million. So you've got the correct number.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. And then on the revenue side, Gary, it's been my experience doing this for a long time and having the famous 14-week quarter roll through, it's -- I think the best practice I found is, you end up really not getting the extra revenue per se, but you got to obviously count the expenses. So that's sort of the way to think about it. So, we don't -- we're not saying, hey, because Q4 is 14 weeks, we're going to have some better growth than we would have. I think it's just -- that's kind of what the market is doing. So the -- and then Willem gave you sort of the run rate on OpEx. If you look at it, netting out what 13 weeks would have been, which is about $420 million.\nGary Mobley: Got it. Thanks, again, guys.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Marvell Technology Inc.’s First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Marvell's first fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Willem Meintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measure is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell's revenue was 1.322 billion, above the midpoint of guidance. Higher revenue drove our non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.31, $0.02 above the mid-point. We were guiding revenue for the second quarter to go to 133 billion at the mid-point and expect sequential revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year. Before we get to our results for each end market, let me start by discussing the tremendous opportunity that AI represents for Marvell. In the past, we considered AI to be one of many applications within cloud, but its importance and therefore the opportunity has increased dramatically. Generative AI is rapidly driving new applications and changing the investment priorities for our cloud customers. Today's AI workloads require truly massive datasets. To efficiently process this data, the architecture for AI data centers is significantly different than standard cloud infrastructure. Rather than dual socket servers at the core element in Iraq, the primary building block in AI is a system containing multiple accelerators such as GPUs. In large deployments, thousands of these systems are interconnected to form a data center sized AI cluster, and what's required to interconnect these systems is orders of magnitude higher than in standard cloud infrastructure. To give you an idea, the latest dual CPU server in the cloud data center today can drive up to 200 gigabits per second of IO and contains the network interfaces to support that bandwidth. In contrast, an example of an advanced AI system containing 8 accelerators can drive close to 30 terabits of full duplex bandwidth. As hundreds of times more bandwidth required to connect these systems together, keep in mind, [meeting cloud data] [ph] centers connect thousands of these systems in a single cluster to provide maximum scalability for their customers with each of these systems capable of driving tens of terabits of network traffic. And in order to create the largest possible cluster sizes at data center scale, these connections need to be able to operate over increasingly long distances. These clusters require a staggering amount of high bandwidth connectivity, all of which needs to be provided at ultra-low latency and high reliability. And within a reasonable power outlook. This connectivity is best provided by fully optically connected infrastructure, utilizing digital signal processing and low latency high capacity fabric switches. This is why we see AI as a strong growth driver for our PAM4 optical DSP platform. And it is important to note that these DSPs are compatible with a variety of network protocols such as Ethernet, InfiniBand, and other proprietary solutions for maximum breadth and flexibility. Going forward, we see this trend only accelerating. While today's most advanced AI systems are already using the highest bandwidth interfaces available, it might surprise you to learn that the performance scale of current AI implementations are still constrained by network capacity. Take the [8 accelerator] [ph] AI system I discussed earlier, for example. Those systems today typically contain four 800 gigabit per second optical interfaces for external connectivity, which provide an aggregate of 3.2 terabits per second of bandwidth. But that is in a system capable of driving close to 10x that bandwidth. To bridge this gap, we expect that the number of optical interfaces per AI system to continue to grow as these clusters scale. And the next generation of accelerators are expected to have even more compute capability and higher bandwidth requirements. Given the speed at which AI infrastructure is advancing, the technology refresh rate is happening at 18 months to 24 months versus 4 plus years in standard infrastructure. Altogether, we expect a massive amount of connectivity in these AI clusters, increasing adoption of higher speed optical interfaces, and faster refresh rates to be a major demand drivers for our PAM4 DSP platform. In fact, in our last earnings call, we indicated that the ramp in our industry leading 800 gig DSP platform was driven almost entirely by AI applications. We have also announced the industry's first 1.6 terabit PAM4 DSP platform, doubling the throughput from the current generation, and we expect AI to drive the initial adoption of these products as well. In addition, as inference is deployed at multiple regional data centers, they need to be connected by high bandwidth low latency optical links over tens of kilometers. This technology has noticed data center interconnect or DCI, and Marvell has been a pioneer in this market. We created the industry's first pluggable module for DCI, and we are now providing 400 gigabits per second in our latest DCI product line. We already seen that AI cloud data centers are driving a significant increase in demand for 400 ZR solution. Another demand driver for our DCI products is that the next generation AI implementations are planning on clustering accelerators across different sites. AI is also a key growth driver of demand for switching inside the data center. Marvell has a growing position in the market for low latency high capacity switches, and we are seeing strong demand for our products. We recently announced our next generation 51.2T Teralynx 10 ethernet switching platform. Platform is based on the low latency architecture we acquired from Innovium and is built on Marvell's leading 5 nanometer technology platform. We are seeing strong interest for this product. We expect AI to lead the industry's transition from today's 12.8T switches to 51.2T enabling a quadrupling and network bandwidth. We expect 51.2T adoption will be a strong growth driver for the networking semiconductor market. Putting it all together, Marvell has built both a leading position and network connectivity for AI. We expect tremendous growth for our PAM4 optics DCI and Ethernet switching solutions fueled by the growing investment in AI. Perhaps even more exciting is Marvell's opportunity to address compute in AI through our cloud optimized silicon platform. As you heard earlier, the architecture of an AI data center is fundamentally different. In standard cloud infrastructure, the bulk of the compute is performed by CPUs, while accelerators are primarily used for off-load tasks, such as networking and security. In contrast in AI infrastructure, accelerators like GPUs are the primary compute engines, while CPUs are used for control purposes, a 180 degree reversal from standard cloud infrastructure. Fundamental difference results in a higher ratio of accelerators to CPUs and AI with accelerators now to dominate compute opportunity. This combined with the sharp increase in AI investment is driving a higher proportion of the incremental compute [PAM] [ph] in cloud data centers towards accelerators. Today, we see cloud customers enhancing their AI offerings by building custom accelerators of their own designed to address their specific needs. This is a core part of Marvell's cloud optimized silicon strategy, and we now see a much larger and faster growing opportunity for custom compute and AI infrastructure. When we previously discussed our cloud optimized silicon opportunities and revenue ramp expectations at our Investor Day in October 2021, we projected revenue from the first set of design wins to grow to $800 million annually once all the programs were in production. These designs included a variety of accelerated computing applications including AI, security, storage, and video along with several networking applications. When we look today at the same set of design wins, driven by AI, our total lifetime revenue expectations from these have increased significantly. Same time, the relative proportion of projected lifetime revenue from AI has increased from approximately 20% in our prior forecast to well over half today. As a result, computing and AI applications has now grown to become the single largest revenue driver and opportunity for Marvell's cloud optimized silicon platform. The continuing increase in demand from AI, we see annual revenue from those same set of cloud optimized design wins, well exceeding the prior 800 million projection as these programs ramp over time. In fact, we have a number of custom silicon products tied to AI expected to ramp into volume production next year. As an example for one of these programs, initial samples are already up and running at our customer's lab and qualification is proceeding well. And in other case, we expect to take out this quarter and deliver first silicon before the end of the calendar year. As you can see, in addition to our strong position in network connectivity for AI, we believe we are well-positioned to address the compute opportunity. Over the last few months, we have taken time and carefully map our revenue from AI so we can track its progress over time. Given the tremendous progress we've made, including the recent demand increases from our customers, we are expecting our revenue driven by AI applications to grow at an accelerated pace. In fiscal 2023, we estimate that our AI revenue was approximately 200 million, up dramatically from the prior year. This revenue was primarily from our PAM4 optics and 400ZR DCI products. Since our last earnings call in early March, bookings for these products have increased very significantly. As a result, we expect Marvell's overall AI revenue to at least double in fiscal 2024. Looking to fiscal 2025, we expect robust growth to continue from AI for network connectivity. Layering on top of this is the growth we expect from the ramp of the cloud optimized programs we discussed earlier in the call. In aggregate, we foresee our overall AI revenue to at least double again next year. In other words, we are forecasting an AI revenue growth CAGR over 100% over the fiscal 2023 to 2025 time frame. In the future, we expect generative AI implementations involving video and images to provide a tailwind to overall storage and exabyte growth, both in HDD and Flash. However, it is difficult to accurately allocate revenue from our storage business specifically to AI. So, the AI revenue forecast I just discussed does not include any storage contributions. In addition, we expect the increase in network traffic from AI will also provide a tailwind for our broader networking portfolio over time, which we have not yet captured in our AI revenue forecast. We've seen rapid shifts in our cloud customers plan to spending on AI infrastructures becoming a much bigger portion of their CapEx. We believe that Marvell is one of a scarce few semiconductor companies positioned to enable this trend and is uniquely able to participate in all three aspects of AI systems, networking, compute, and storage. We set out in 2016 to pivot Marvell to data infrastructure and have successfully executed that strategy, forming the right team, technology, and customer relationships to lead in this market. With AI becoming the ultimate data infrastructure application, Marvell is at the center of this incredible transformation. We are confident that we will be one of the most relied on semiconductor companies to help our customers achieve their vision. We look forward to sharing our continued progress in AI in the future. Let me move on now to reviewing our results and expectations by end market starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the first quarter was 436 million, declining 32% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Our overall data center revenue in the first quarter was higher than guidance driven by cloud where we saw stronger demand for our optical data center interconnect products from expanding AI deployments. As expected, storage was responsible for the majority of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue in the first quarter, although we are forecasting sequential growth to start in the second quarter and our data center storage business continue to grow in the second half. Looking ahead to the second quarter for our overall data center end market, we expect cloud revenue to grow over 10% sequentially. However, we are expecting the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market to decline an offset growth from cloud. As a result, we expect revenue from our overall data center end market to be flat sequentially in the second quarter. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market, revenue for the first quarter was 290 million growing 15% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. We saw strong demand for our wireless products, as 5G adoption continued to expand in new geographic regions along with our customer specific product ramps. This resulted in approximate 25% sequential growth in wireless revenue. Partially offsetting our wireless growth was the start of inventory digestion in our wired end market. Moving on to our outlook for the next quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-single-digits sequentially, due to continued inventory digestion in our wired end market. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the first quarter was 365 million, growing 27% year-over-year and flat sequentially, which is better than our guidance. Our first quarter enterprise networking results reflected a strong ramp in custom ASICs offset by our planned reduction in channel and customer inventory of our merchant products. Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we project our enterprise networking revenue to decline by more than 10% sequentially, due to inventory corrections in this end market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue in the first quarter was 89 million, flat year-over-year and declining 10% sequentially. While our automotive business continues to deliver strong growth both year-over-year and sequentially, these gains were offset by a decline in our industrial business. Looking to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we project revenue from our auto and industrial end market to grow sequentially in the low teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the first quarter was 142 million below our guidance declining 20% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are forecasting revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-30% range, driven by strong seasonal growth in demand for our custom SSD controllers. In addition, we are expecting growth from our ACD controllers as we start shipping closer to end market consumption. In summary, we are guiding sequential growth to resume starting with the second quarter and we expect growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year. Few markets remain choppy and we expect revenue from our wired and enterprise end markets to continue to trend down due to macroeconomic uncertainty and inventory corrections. We expect revenue from our wireless end market to step-up in the third quarter before taking a pause and declining in the fourth quarter. We see many positive signs in our data center end markets. We are forecasting our data center storage revenue to resume growth in the second quarter and continue to improve as we start shipping closer to end market demand. Putting aside storage, we expect cloud to be the key growth driver for our data center revenue. We are guiding our cloud revenue to grow over 10% sequentially in the second quarter, and we are seeing a significant increase in demand from AI for the rest of the year. In addition, we expect our cloud optimized silicon programs to ramp more meaningfully as the year progresses, in-line with the revised expectations we outlined during last quarter's call. As a result, we are confident in our expectations for higher growth for the company in the second half of the year. We also expect to drive significant margin improvement going forward. We anticipate that inventory corrections will be mostly behind us by the end of this year, and we are excited about the resumption of revenue growth driven by Marvell's specific product ramps. We have been laser focused on a number of cost improvement actions to improve gross margin. As a result, we have confidence in our forecast for our non-GAAP gross margin to return to at least the low-end of our target range in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. We've been in extensive discussions with our customers and have a clear view of their current road maps. While some programs have been pushed out, others have been accelerated. We are aggressively reprioritizing our investments, aligning to the highest ROI opportunities in front of us. We are also focused on driving additional efficiency to further reduce our operating expenses. We are making strategic road map adjustments and combining some of our businesses to reflect changes in the market. As an example, resulting from our customers' growing needs for custom compute, we've combined our custom ASIC and processor product groups into a single organization. Other teams are also working on efficiency improvements. As a result, we expect our OpEx to exit at a lower run rate than previously communicated. This discipline on expenses is expected to carry into fiscal 2025 and help us to deliver strong operating leverage going forward. Willem will provide more details in his commentary. Before closing, I'd like to express my appreciation to Rick Hill, who will be retiring from the Marvell Board at the end of his current term. Rick joined Marvell a little over 7 years ago as Chairman of the Board and acting CEO during a very difficult time. He moved quickly to stabilize the company, personally reassuring customers, employees, and shareholders. He helped establish a world-class board of directors and was instrumental in the recruiting of the first key group of executives. I joined Marvell in large part because of Rick. It is very rare to find an individual who is willing to contribute their time and energy and impart their wisdom to others for the satisfaction of seeing a company thrive and the next generation leaders succeed. At the most critical moments over the past 7 years, Rick always had the Marvell teams back and his belief in the team enabled us to take bold steps to transform the company. Without his leadership and mentorship, Marvell would not be where it is today. I'm truly grateful to Rick for his exceptional contributions to Marvell, and it's an honor for me to succeed him as Board Chair. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to Dr. Ed Frank, who joined us from the Cavium Board in 2018. Ed has been an outstanding director and will be retiring for the Marvell Board when his term expires in June. I'm grateful to Ed for his years of dedicated service to Marvell. Finally, I want to thank our dedicated team of employees. Together, we are moving forward with confidence that Marvell's best days are yet to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks Matt, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the first quarter was 1.322 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance declining 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 33% of total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest with 27% of total revenue followed by carrier infrastructure at 22%, consumer at 11%, and auto industrial at 7%. GAAP gross margin was 42.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in-line with guidance. Our gross margin results reflected the adverse revenue mix we had forecasted for this first quarter. GAAP operating expenses were 740 million, including share based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs related to headcount reductions, and acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 459 million, slightly below guidance. First quarter operating expenses reflected the step-up from the prior quarter, due to typical seasonality and payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. GAAP operating margin was negative 13.8%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.3%. For the first quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.20. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.31, $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance. Now, turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was 208 million. This included 40 million in payments for previously committed long-term capacity payments. Looking ahead, we are currently anticipating minimal additional payments for capacity for the rest of fiscal 2024 and beyond. As a result, we expect a much reduced headwind to operating cash flow as compared to fiscal 2023, where payments for long-term capacity totaled approximately 250 million. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was 1.03 billion, decreasing by 42 million sequentially. Our days sales outstanding was 69 days, a decrease of 7 days from the prior quarter. We returned 51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were 1.03 billion, almost all of which is held in systemically important banks. Our total debt was 4.68 billion, which included a drawdown of 200 million from our revolving line of credit. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. Before I provide specific guidance for the second quarter, let me describe our plan for gross margin, operating expenses, and capital allocation for the rest of the year. As you are aware, significant inventory corrections in certain businesses caused an adverse revenue mix, which impacted our gross margin. We are optimistic that inventory corrections will be largely done by the fourth quarter and that we will be shipping closer to end demand at that time. We have also put in place multiple cost reduction efforts to improve gross margin. Internally, we are optimizing headcount and further streamlining operations. Externally, we continue to partner with our strategic suppliers to drive more efficiency in the supply chain. We are confident that as a result of mix improvement and our cost reduction efforts, our non-GAAP gross margin will start to improve. We expect modest improvement in the third quarter and by the fourth quarter, we can return to at least the low-end of our target range of 64% to 66%. As Matt told you, we are making strategic road map adjustments and driving additional efficiencies all whilst maintaining our long-term growth outlook. As a result, we expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter to be approximately 430 million. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 is a 14-week quarter. So, included in this forecast is approximately 10 million in expenses for the extra week. Therefore, on a normalized 13-week basis, we expect the run rate for our non-GAAP OpEx exiting this year to be 420 million. As we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect that typical seasonality and payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases in the first quarter will cause OpEx to step-up sequentially. As a result, we are modeling first quarter fiscal 2025 OpEx to increase sequentially by mid-to-high single-digits on a percentage basis from the normalized 13-week exit rate of 420 million in the prior quarter. We are confident that this sets us up to drive tremendous operating leverage next year. In terms of capital allocation, we have 500 million of our total debt due in January 2023 that we are planning on paying off using our cash balance and free cash flow. This will improve our gross leverage meaningfully going forward. Following this payoff, we expect to resume our buyback program in the third quarter. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of 1.33 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 44.3% to 46.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 60% to 61%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 694 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 455 million. We expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt to be approximately 51 million. For the second quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 7%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 861 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 865 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.16 per share on the low-end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high-end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.27 to $0.37. In summary, as we move forward through this fiscal year, we project our revenue to continue to grow sequentially, gross margin to improve significantly in the fourth quarter, and operating expenses to continue to step down. Our DSO and inventory have already shown signs of improvement. As a result, we are looking forward to driving tremendous operating leverage and significant improvement in cash flow generation over this year, while setting up a strong platform for growth next year. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. It sounds like things have changed significantly since your last call, Matt. You went through the AI side in great details and then the cyclical side sounds like it's bottoming. I just wanted to have you dive into a little bit about the customer behavior. Is it just the cycle side that you find the bottom on finally? Is it the AI side that's really accelerating? Just talk about how that behavior has changed over the course of your quarter if you could, please?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Hey, Ross. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's encouraging to see revenue growth in the second quarter. So overall, with the total company revenue bottoming and then encouraging to see cloud pick back up, growing sequentially in Q2, you know, 10%, kind of plus, and that's driven by AI. So that's certainly been a positive. I think, maybe I'll just talk about the rest of the business. There's a number of moving pieces. A lot of it barely pretty much came in line in terms of things like carrier, automotive, etcetera. So, we haven't seen a ton of behavior change there. Really the biggest change, I would say is that, the – I think two things related to AI. The first is just the level of bookings, backlog, forecast increase, particularly for our optical products has increased significantly. That's a positive. The second is that we really took the time between last quarter and this quarter to, in a very detailed manner, quantify our AI revenue stream, where it was coming from, what's driving it. We now have it actually embedded in our system as a separate end market that we can filter by. So, we have a good view of the history, a good view of the future. And we definitely wanted to take the time so that when we communicated numbers, they were rock solid. And what you're seeing is a really positive story, which is basically, you know, around a $200 million level of revenue for AI last year. And then, you know, at least what we see is doubling this year and then at least doubling again next year. So, that's probably been the single biggest change. I'd say, just the uptick in AI, which was a little bit behind some of the announcements maybe going on last quarter, but it's definitely here for us. And I'd say the broader cloud infrastructure side, non-AI is also picking up and will also grow in the second quarter and grow throughout the year and actually has a great set-up for next year as well. So, those are some of the things that have gone on. And just one final note on the AI stuff, we – I said in my prepared remarks, but just for everybody on the call, we deliberately don't include storage at this time in AI. We found it pretty difficult to map that particular set of products, you know, directly to AI systems or not. Clearly, there's going to be a tailwind for that business over time just given the amount of data that's going to need to get stored. But so really what you're seeing is, I think a very clean and very exciting AI number.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I'm kind of wondering if you can frame, Matt, how much you think revenue is going to start to grow in the back half of the year. There's kind of a lot of moving parts wired and enterprise business are still digesting inventory. Data center is going to be up in the back half of the year. It sounds like that's due to cloud and there is some storage coming back as well. But many of the big networking OEMs are still sitting on record inventories, Cisco, Arista, you know Juniper. So, can you just sort of frame how much you think revenue can grow as you get into fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4? Is it reasonable to expect, kind of mid-single digits or even better for each of those quarters? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Hey, Tim. So, I’d just give you some data, sort of what way to think about it. I think first is, we just start with the second quarter. Okay. So, we're seeing sequential growth. And again, when you look at the data center piece. The cloud growth is being offset by continued weakness in on-prem enterprise. And as you've noted, that's clearly been an issue for, kind of the overall server market the last probably five quarters, if you kind of take the read-through to enterprise networking, same thing. There's a lot of inventory on the customer balance sheet. So, we have signaled for some time. We expect that that continues to correct throughout the year. I think what I'd really point you to is, the company has inflected back-up in terms of growth in Q2. And as we look out, you know, even beyond the second half. I mean, if you just kind of look into the next year, we have the AI doubling again, you know, at least in our fiscal 2025. We see strong continued growth in our cloud infrastructure. So, non-AI the cloud, also driving meaningful growth. That's both growth and optics, as well as storage coming back, as well as some cloud optimized programs. So, that's a positive. Automotive continues to grow next year. And then as you as you indicated, you know, storage is still very low. It's come off the bottom in our guide for Q2, but should be back, you know, next year. So, lot of very strong growth drivers. So, you need to kind of draw a line between the first half now and next year. And I think the way you're thinking about it is the right, which is some of the markets are going to be choppier like enterprise. And we also said that in carrier, we've had this incredible run in our 5G wireless business over the last several years. We actually see that continue in Q2 and Q3, but probably in the fourth quarter is where that will drop off after a long run. It just – we've got our own product cycles going, but that gets more than offset, obviously, by all the growth in data center. So, great set-up for the second half. Really Cloud AI driven and would more than offset any, kind of comprehensive weakness or choppiness in some of the other end markets. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nTimothy Arcuri : Thanks, Matt. So, I guess, you don't you don't want to put a number on it. So, like, mid-single-digits, you don't…\nMatt Murphy: We don't, yeah. We’re not yet. And the bottom line is, we're not – like most companies, we're not going to guide the second half specifically at this point, but clearly going to accelerate off of where we are today.\nTimothy Arcuri: Perfect. Okay, Matt. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for the question. Matt, I just wanted to understand what specifically is included in AI this year. I think you're suggesting about 400 million or so in terms of a double from last year. How much of that is your electro optics, are you including the Innovium switches and that, what about your cloud optimized silicon, where I think the number was 200 million for this year? So, what exactly is included in AI for this year? And when you spoke about the potential for it to double again next year, of those three pieces, are all three going to double, is one going to grow more? So, just if you could give us a little more clarity around what exactly is included in AI for this year and among that, what will grow next year?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Great question, Vivek. So, when you think about this year, it's – we said it's, you know, at least doubling. So, think of it as 400 plus and it wants to be more, by the way, and we're working on that. That is almost, you know, almost completely driven by our PAM4 optics, PAM4 DSP, as well as some of the DCI stuff that's driving a lot of AI traffic and regional data center. So, think of it as mostly driven by optics. Some networking as you point out and probably a little bit of cloud optimized, but think of it as mostly just really strong 800 gig ramp that we're seeing in PAM4. That continues into next year, but then we layer in the cloud optimized ramps as well. And so both of those contribute to the incremental growth and the, sort of over doubling into the next year. And as we get through the year Vivek, we'll be able to quantify this a little bit more. I mean, you can imagine how fast things are moving in this area. It's incredibly dynamic, it's incredibly exciting, and positive. And I'd say almost on a daily or every other day basis, there's, sort of new positive incremental updates. So, as we go forward, we'll share more, but think of it really this year as the PAM4 train running very strong into next year, and then we start layering and the cloud optimized on top of it. And as we said in the prepared remarks, I think what's really exciting is those wins we articulated several years ago, right at our 2021 Analyst Day. So, these are products we've been working on for some time now. And, you know, normally, products take about 18 months to 24 months to develop and then a period of time to ramp. So, next year, the timing looks really good.\nVivek Arya: Sorry, Matt. On this cloud optimize, is it still 200 million for this year, so partially in AI? And then what is the number for cloud optimized for next year?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. So, what we said, what I said, and there was a lot in the detail, but we reconfirmed we're tracking to the number we gave you guys last time, which was the 200 million. I'd say, it is potentially higher, but I think that's a safe number. And then at a high level, I think, just given how dynamic the situation is, we're not guiding a specific number for next year. But what we did say is, the original, sort of estimate back in, when we gave it at the at the Analyst Day in 2021 it was that you have, you know, 800 million and kind of the fiscal 2025 to 2026 time frame. And then what I updated on the call was that that peak revenue was actually going to exceed the 800 million, just given that the total lifetime volume now of those same design wins has actually increased pretty significantly. And then the percentage of those has moved meaningfully towards AI. So, it's all tracking in the right direction for this year and then for next year we'll see how it goes. You know, I really don't want to cap it quite frankly, and it's too early to even call a number.\nVivek Arya: Understood. Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. That's a lot of very helpful details there, Matt. I actually wanted to turn on to Willem on the gross margin side. So, what are the assumptions for the fourth quarter, because you guys sound very, I don't know if it’s the right word, convicted about hitting that in the fourth quarter? So, just kind of help us understand the assumptions, how much of it is – some of it has to be based on the top line recovery as well, right? So, just give us confidence on that, please.\nWillem Meintjes: Yes. Ambrish, thanks for the question. So, yes, we're very confident on getting back to the bottom end of our range in Q4. Some of the main drivers, I think, as Matt pointed out, that wireless carrier, we expect that to continue to be really strong through the third quarter and then really to take a step down in Q4. We've seen the storage recovery starting, and we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter. And then, I'd also point to the optical products and by AI. We're seeing that strength pick up through the year. And all of those are very much accretive to our gross margin. But then in addition to that, all the OpEx reduction initiatives that we're driving internally, as well as the work that we're doing with our supply chain. We expect all that to really more meaningfully impact our P&L in Q4. So, that gives us confidence. Hopefully, that would clarify. Thank you.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Yes. So, just a clarification because tied to that, you said the inventory would be largely over excess inventory. So, it sounds like on the cloud side that is behind us. And is it fair to assume that networking is where the vestiges remain towards the end of the year? Matt, is that the right way to think about it in terms of excess inventory?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. I think I would – well, let me clarify one thing. I'd say, we're not completely out of the woods yet on cloud. So, I'd say the – think of it as the 10% sequential growth, which is really positive, by the way. We're happy to see that inflect back up. The way to kind of think about it is the AI portion of it is moving up quite dramatically, as you can imagine. But the traditional infrastructure side is also going up, but it’s still got a little bit to clear. So, actually, I'd say there's a little bit more tailwind there in terms of inventory digestion on the cloud side, which would be, kind of additional stuff. So that would kick in. And then storage is still – we're still way under shipping demand. So that will be a positive exiting the year. And then, yes, you're right, like we took some actions in enterprise on our own, some in Q1 that didn't quite get it all done. So, we're getting it all – the rest of it done in Q2. These are more us driving it in terms of working inventory down, so that when we exit the year, it's more rebalanced. So, there's a few pockets where there's still some inventory overhang, obviously, something like an AI is not, and then wireless 5G, I mean that just stepped up 25% sequentially. So, we've been shipping pretty hard on that one. But yes, there's a few pieces. But when you kind of add it all up, we see across the board, we should be in pretty good shape in terms of shipping back to what normalized demand would be. And that was really Willem's point, it’s just some of these product lines that just when they come back to normal shipping to demand run rate, it's definitely a tailwind for gross margin. And then, of course, on top of that, we have our own programs we're driving to ensure our success to get the gross margins back up.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you. Super helpful.\nOperator: The next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for taking the question. Matt, I just wanted to go to some of your AI comments, I thought it was super interesting. You talked about the mix of lifetime revenue moving from 20% to 50%. And you also gave us that extra year. But I'm just trying to understand, have you seen an influx of new projects that you've started that would then come out then? I mean you're giving us an extra view, so maybe some of this was in the works before? And then I guess, kind of just conceptually why that mix kind of shifted so much? I mean, it would suggest a pretty high percentage of your out-year there. So, just kind of curious how all this unfolds over the last quarter?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Well, I think, Blayne, there's kind of a couple of pieces to that. So, the first is, we had an initial set of design wins that we sized and articulated at the October 2021 Investor Day. And that was this $400 million going to $800 million. And as you pointed out, roughly 20% of that lifetime revenue at the time was for AI, 80% was sort of for traditional cloud infrastructure. And then now we've seen, sort of the AI piece really take-off in terms of expectations for it. So, that – just to clarify, that is just going apples-to-apples with what we communicated two years ago. I mean – and those are the projects now that are coming to fruition. But I mean, just to be very clear, since that time, we have layered in a significant number of incremental new design wins. And those are – many of those are now underway, probably not as much revenue from those next year, but then those would be, sort of the year after. And I would just also add that our design win funnel, and this is data I was just reviewing at the company level, who's just expanded dramatically with the biggest portion of that coming from our cloud design win funnel. And then of the cloud, you can imagine the AI portion has become very significant versus where it was 2 or 3 years ago. So, I'd say on a number of aspects, wins we claimed 2 years ago go into production. Incremental activity and wins since then, so that would indicate long-term even a higher number in terms of our AI potential. And then the funnel looks extremely robust. And so that all leads to a, I think, a very bright outlook in terms of where this can go over the next 5 to 7 years depending on how long it takes to, sort of flow all these through. So, we're in the very early innings here, Blayne, I think, as you can imagine.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for that. I just want to follow up on the carrier side. I think in the past, you talked about maybe India would be that source of growth. I think you're now saying after a bunch of quarters of growth, maybe it would be down a bit. I’m just trying to understand, did something change in your expectation for that India rollout or is it just the softness in the inventory with the other regions?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, I think, Blayne, the way to think about it is, generally, I'd say, this has been our story for 5G as it's unfolded over the last, call it, 3 years. It's grown virtually almost every quarter. And if you look at where we were coming off of last year, we were pretty excited, right? We hit kind of the $600 million bogey we had talked about. And then we had to step up big time in Q1 of 25% sequential off of Q4, which we said is going to continue actually in Q2 and probably remain strong through Q3. So, at some point, this base station market is pretty lumpy, especially the deployment. There's a lot of concern around CapEx out there. Some people have already, sort of seen it, but given that we're mostly in new products, and we don't have a lot of 4G overhang, we've been able to power through. But yes, I think the India stuff is definitely comprehended in this 25% step-up we already took and then really three very strong quarters this year before we see a drop off in Q4. And then sometime in next year, we'll have some growth again at some point. But it's been running pretty hot. And I think we've been pretty much way outperforming in terms of what other people are seeing in the telecom market.\nOperator: The next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you and congrats on turning around the ship here. I had a question about storage, Matt. So, I know it's hard for you to identify how much was related to AI and you, kind of don't want to give a number going forward either. But as we start to think about CXL, especially because now that there's, you know AI is driving some pull-in on some of these next-generation technologies, I would think that that could be already an opportunity for you next year. So, any color you can give us on how big the storage business could be in AI over the next few years?\nMatt Murphy: Got it. Yes. Tore, you bring up a very good point. So, when I referred to storage earlier, it was really on the existing product lines we have, which is primarily hard disk drive controllers, preamplifiers, and flash controllers. And that one, we just – we tried. We spent a lot of time on it over the last 3 months, trying to map it and ultimately, we just said, let's keep it out for now. But you have a very good point in that, something I haven't talked about, which is there's going to be a tremendous demand for CXL in these large systems, especially as the DRAM and the memory really needs to scale pretty dramatically. And we are seeing strong pull from customers on those solutions and kind of the lead product we're doing is under a lot of scheduled pressure to get it out because of the need. So, I think that's another leg to the stool. That's not really in our, kind of comprehended in our next year numbers per se, but it's definitely out there. And I think that's going to drive a whole other segment for us. I'd also say there's things like AECs, which is another product category that we've invested in that's getting extremely strong traction, very happy with the progress there. That's something that can layer in again over time. So, there's a few other shots on goal we have that really leverage the core DSP and analog mixed signal capability we have inside of Marvell. And we're going to continue to try to leverage those and really be as broad-based as a supplier as we can. And again, and if you think about, sort of all the [hops] [ph], all the data hops that are coming in and out of these systems, we want to be the lead company that our customers go to for these solutions, whether it's CXL, ACs, PAM4 DSP, optics, DCI. And then, of course, the more exciting, not more but has exciting opportunity in the custom silicon area. So, a lot of stuff going on.\nTore Svanberg: Great perspective. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. A follow-up question on storage and really trying to think through the ramp in the second half, both for data center and consumer. For data center, I think that business was probably down $150 million peak to trough, just for the controller side. And so, curious how we should think about that step-up into October and January? And then the same thing on the consumer side, that business is up, I think, implied about $50 million sequentially in July. Is that sustainable into the second half of the year? Thanks so much.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Let me take it in two pieces. So, on the data center side, it did bottom out in Q1. So, it will be up a little bit in Q2, but more – it will kind of grow throughout the year, but really I don't think it recovers – and even if it doesn't recover all the way, it recovers mostly probably by the fourth quarter, C.J., the January quarter, not the third quarter. But it will – think of Q1 and Q2 as being very, very low. And then it comes back in the second half step-up in Q3 and then in Q4. And we're really not modeling it at this point even in Q4 getting back up to like 100% of where it was.  I think, we're probably at 75% to 80%, just in our own models, just to be conservative. But certainly, over time, that should normalize. So that's the data center one. The good news is, it's come off the bottom and it's growing in Q2 and will get better in the second half. On the consumer side, yes, this is not a super strategic end market for us. There's some moving pieces. Q1, if you looked at, it was a little bit low, Q2 has got this kind of funky 30% growth. That's on the flash side, kind of normalize those two. It's probably in the range of where it should be. Just the way to think about overall consumer is, it's actually outperformed if you went back to, kind of our Investor Day model a few years ago, it’s seen a lot of strength. But at some point, it's going to – and our model was always to trend down over time. I would say that probably starts in the second half and continues through next year. And look, if we get a bluebird, that's great. You never know, we got a lot of bluebirds over the last few years. But just given we don't put a lot of R&D behind it, the way to think about consumer is you got Q1 and Q2, just assume the second half is probably lower and then it just trends down over time, more in-line with what we talked about at the Investor Day model. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nC.J. Muse: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you. Gentlemen, I was wondering how much of the uptick in your data center business outlook is coming from the expanded TAM opportunity from a competitor exiting investment of their networking ASIC division where your Innovium business competes quite well?\nMatt Murphy: Oh, I see. Yes, you're talking about the switching portfolio, Karl?\nKarl Ackerman: Correct.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Okay. No, I would say, definitely aware of that repositioning going on by one of the other companies. We hadn't really seen that solution very much out there. I mean maybe that's one of the reasons why they've sort of reprioritized, but we see a lot of traction for that product line. I mean, the way you can think about it is – and maybe I'll just use this, Karl, just to take a second just to answer, kind of a bigger question that some investors have, which is, hey, if you've got all this CapEx shifting to AI, then what happens to the traditional cloud infrastructure side? Does Marvell get impacted by that? Do things like switches, right, as an example, or networking get less spend or do the optics get less spend? And how do you think about that? So, I'd say, one, first of all, we definitely see the AI trend that's obvious that the CapEx is going to move there. But we still see very strong growth for our portfolio in the traditional infrastructure, which includes our switching platforms, which, by the way, some of those will also go back into AI as well. But if you just sort of think about that the spend that's left is going to be – the dollars are going to be badly needed to make sure that the entire front-end network and the connections between data centers and all of the bandwidth that's required to actually move vast amounts of data inside and out of the data centers, that all needs to still get upgraded. So, I think we still see our traditional cloud infrastructure portfolio growing very strongly second half of this year and next year and the switching portfolio was part of it. We've really doubled down in this area, Karl. We've taken the Innovium product line. We've combined it with our switching broader switching organization. We brought in a new general manager reporting directly to me who is managing all of our higher layer networking technology. We're leveraging that with our optics and long-term, even co-packaged optics road map. So, a lot of investment, a lot of excitement, and we're very happy with how our first product looks in 5-nanometer, which is at 51.2T, we announced it recently, and now it's back. So, all that's going well, Karl. We don't see any real impact from the competitor exiting. We look at more that there's just a growing market, a large opportunity for, I think, people who provide high-performance, higher layer networking technologies to all growth and the market is going to grow a lot.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. That's very helpful. Perhaps if I could ask another follow-up. Could you discuss the debate on the competitive dynamics of AI. There have been some ASIC design houses in China winning AI designs from hyperscalers, but given the extended revenue trajectory that you spoke about today of your AI programs, it doesn't sound like the competitive landscape has altered your view of the long-term opportunity you see in compute offload in different areas of AI, but if you could just perhaps put a finer point on that, that would be quite helpful? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Well, yes, I think, yes, as you heard from our comments, even the wins we got a few years ago, which we had I think at the time, thought we signed appropriately, maybe a little conservatively, but we thought we sized them appropriately. Those have expanded, and those are products we're already developing or have developed. And so that, sort of opportunity that's already there. And I guess the other thing I look at is the design win funnel, and that's expanded dramatically across the board for AI, but a lot of it is in compute offload acceleration, and kind of custom computing. I'd say from a competitive standpoint, and you mentioned potentially overseas competitors. I mean, just given the nature of the criticality of these types of systems. And even at some point, maybe a national security type of concern for this type of AI technology, my belief is that the companies that have strong U.S.-based presence, strong IP portfolio, able to invest in the bleeding-edge technology road map, like 5-nanometer, like 3-nanometer, you name it. Those are the ones that are going to win and be able to do these – not only design the chips, but manufacture them into high volume and have the scale and capacity to do that. And Marvell is one of just a couple of companies probably that can really, really compete at that level. There may be one-offs here and there. But I just think long-term, the largest companies out there are going to look to the scaled up largest suppliers to support them. Thanks Karl for the question. Appreciate it.\nKarl Ackerman : Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the last question on switching. So, I think you might have mentioned this Matt, but I just wanted to verify. Did the team get first silicon [indiscernible] silicon back on your next-generation 51.2T Teralynx 10 switching chipset, any feedback on the performance or do you ship samples to customers? And then your design win funnel is clearly expanding at a significant pace, as you mentioned, right? I think it was last October, the team announced their 3-nanometer IP libraries, right, high-speed idle building blocks, ARM-based cores, so library. So, on this expanding design win funnel, has the team already engaged and is already starting new design wins on 3-nanometer?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, great couple of questions. I think the first one is pretty simple, the product, which we call TL10 or Teralynx 10, we have product in hand. It's looking good. We have a lot of demand to try to ramp this product up, quite frankly, as fast as we can. That's all going well. And on 3-nanometer, a lot of activity there, pretty similar to, I’d say Harlan, to 5-nanometer, where we really readied ourselves at the right time to be able to bid competitively with the best of the best out there. And I'd say, we're extremely well positioned today on 3-nanometer. I'd say just in general, there's a ton of activity, and I think we're sort of in all those conversations. I would say though that – when we said this previously, the 5-nanometer is going to continue to be a very long, steady workhorse technology that serves a lot of needs for a long time. And I think just in general, as you sort of get to this leading edge we're at, I think it's going to be – customers are going to be more and more choosy about really weighing cost, power, performance, timing, schedule, the whole 9-yards versus it used to be just kind of automatic. You went from 28, then when you went to 16, and then you went to 12, and then you went to – just people you just, sort of was like, you just jump. And I think it's each of these is going to have their place in terms of the application set that they serve. So, we're well-positioned really well on both. But certainly for 3-nanometer, we're in the middle of some pretty exciting discussions across almost all of our major end markets.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you for the update Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Harlan. I think we – maybe a couple more questions, and then we'll wrap it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Hey guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. [Indiscernible] getting here. So, I appreciate it. So, I have two different questions for you guys. They're unrelated. The first one is, in the guidance here in the short-term, certainly, it seems like consumer SSD is driving some pretty strong growth. And maybe you could give us a little bit more color on your confidence of seen ability of that market, just given – I mean there certainly are some concerns in pace of China recovery, just return of enterprise, sort of spend in notebook markets and things like that. I'm just trying to understand like the sustainability of that or is this, sort of a snapback off the bottom? Any color there would be helpful. And I guess my second question, really, really encouraging to hear about all these, sort of momentum in the design win pipeline. And obviously, there was a near-term correction in storage and few pushouts. But if you back-up to the 10,000-foot view, it seems like the business momentum has still been really, really strong, and I'm trying to juxtapose that against some OpEx cuts and belt tightening and other things that you guys have done, which seems like this would be the time to be investing more rather than less. So, I'm just trying to square that circle. Hopefully, that makes sense. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Totally. Yes, let me answer both and if Willem wants to jump in on the second one at the end, he can. On the first one, yes, I wouldn't really read too much into this one, Matt. The way to think about how that consumer storage business has evolved is, it's a limited number of products. They're really customized designs, I would say. And I wouldn't – I think somebody earlier you may have been going through [security as this] [ph] we basically said, hey, just sort of assume the first half, Q1 plus Q2, kind of average that out, that's probably where that – there's a little bit of lumpiness. We were down in Q1. It's kind of going back up in Q2. But if you look at that, half over half, it should be down in the second half and over time, consumer for us will just trend down, kind of in-line with our Investor Day model. So, I wouldn't – I would not sort of assume that, that just keeps going. I would take a very kind of conservative view on our consumer business. And if it does better, that would be great. We just sort of bank it, put it away and cash the check. But it's not something we put a lot of R&D to in anymore. These are designs from some time ago, and there's a little bit of just a funky Q1, Q2 dynamic on the demand. So, I wouldn't read too much into that. I'm glad you asked on the OpEx. Let me just give you my take and Willem can chime in. So, when – look, we do our annual strategic plan in Marvell usually every August, kind of September. And so, we did that last year. And between now and then, the world has really changed. It's changed in terms of the market dynamics, what's happening with some of our major customers. The macro economy is different. Interest rates are different. You name it, right? It's sort of summer of last year versus now. And so, we're always very thoughtful about how we think about our R&D and capital allocation. I mean, in my mind, it's the most important thing, Matt, that we do, okay? That lever is really going to be our future or not. And things have changed. And so, we did a very extensive review last quarter, very methodically of all the programs in flight by business unit, by product line, looked at how they compare to what our original estimates were for our estimates, at least the last time we posted it. And we made a number of decisions on some programs where the sponsorship really wasn't there or the customer they were wavering or their plans changed. And at the same time, you've got this inflection where huge surge in demand for AI type of things, optics, you name it. And so, we've done some pretty aggressive repositioning in terms of our spending footprint. And so, we're able to exit the year in a lower OpEx footprint than we're running today, but it's still at an incredibly healthy level. I mean, we're spending more as a percent of R&D than almost all of our peers of, sort of similar or even larger size. We've allocated more R&D to some of the key areas where we see just a lot of activity and growth. In some cases, we've rightsized certain product groups that maybe their new reality is different. Maybe it's a legacy business. It's running at a lower level than it was before. We're just sort of dealing with that on an individual group by individual group basis. And then in some cases, we're just getting more efficiency. I mean as an example, we took our processor business unit and our custom ASIC group. And over time, those two teams end up, kind of at the same customer, they end up sharing IP. We're in all the joint meetings together. And so, Raghib Hussain made the decision, which I think is spot-on, which was to combine those into a single organization. And when you do that, you typically get some efficiency savings. So, I feel very confident in the OpEx profile of the company exiting the year. I think it's appropriate for the conditions we're in. The growth areas are getting more and we're just being very judicious about how we do it. And quite frankly, we had a lot of [growth there] [ph]. We acquired a couple of companies over the last few years. Marvell effectively doubled, right, kind of from pre-pandemic to now in terms of revenues. And so, there was just an opportunity really to go through, kind of systematically and look at what do we need to run this company and run it with compelling financials with a setup for next year with that, sort of OpEx profile and spending level to really enable a tremendous drop through to the bottom line as we get leverage in some of these new design wins kicking in. And so, look, we're going to keep evaluating all the opportunities on a systematic basis. And as our revenues improve and as we see the growth ahead, we'll layer back in, in a thoughtful way. But right now, take kind of the Q4 exit rate that Willem talked about. There'll be some normal step-up in Q1, which would really be just normal payroll tax and merit. And then that's probably, kind of where we hang out for the first half of next year, at least at this time.  Again, if things change and revenues going gangbusters and something we'll look at it, but we're sort of set-up right now to have a very strong flow through, drop through next year and have not sacrificed any growth opportunities. Long answer, but I did want to cover it for the whole investor team out there.\nAshish Saran: Can you get the last question please.\nMatt Murphy: That's the last question, yeah.\nAshish Saran: I think there's one more, Matt.\nOperator: The last question today will come from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Matt, your enterprise networking business and carrier, obviously, they've grown very strongly in the last couple of years. and you're guiding for, kind of somewhat softer second half, which makes sense. I'm just curious, as we go into the next year, it looks like 5G is at a point where most of the world now has 5G. And in enterprise, the macro is not exactly encouraging right now. So, just curious to hear your thoughts on how you're thinking about the growth in those segments as we go into the first half of next year?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, great questions. And I think we've got a very, kind of practical view on these, Srini. So, on enterprise, I think you indicated in your part of your question, I mean, this actually business is really outperformed relative to the expectations we set at our Investor Day in 2021. Lot of great progress on share gains, content gains as things like multi-gig ramped up, we added things like new custom ASICs. So, that business has sort of outperformed, but it's outperformed because the market was good, but also really because of our own doing. And so, we've been saying for some time, it's going to correct.  It did better than we thought in Q1, but it will come down in Q2. And yes, I think that environment you've sort of got is correct. But I think of enterprise, at least now it's kind of at least if you look at it year-on-year from last year, this year or next year, it's kind of flattish. We've got – even if there's some – there'll be quarters where it's down more. But if you, sort of normalize it, there'll be – we still have, sort of a strong story underneath, if you will. But we're not saying it's a grower for sure, and there'll be a couple of quarters or however long it takes to do some inventory clearing. I think you're right on overall carrier, especially on 5G. There's been very robust deployments worldwide. You still got things like India, which are happening this year, and there'll be more other regions next year. But I do think that overall, the market side will probably move down. At the same time, we still have content gains in front of us. So, that's a little bit of an offset. There's still at least one kind of bigger socket that still hasn't ramped. So, I think our content story is still pretty good in 5G. But look, we've got pretty good visibility through the third quarter of this year, after that, we do think it's going to drop in Q4, and then where it ends up next year is, kind of a little bit early, but I'd say, at some point, we have content that layers in there, too. So, hopefully, that's helpful to kind of paint a picture, but we're not pounding the table that these are going to be continued growth drivers into 2025. We're actually modeling. And then something like wired, we're modeling it to still stay pretty weak in telecom for some time. So, there's some puts and takes, obviously, in the overall business.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Thanks Matt.\nMatt Murphy: With that I think we could wrap it. A lot of questions, I know. But we want to make sure we answered them all. We appreciate everybody's participation today. I look forward to the call backs and talking to everybody afterwards. So, thanks very much, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.
