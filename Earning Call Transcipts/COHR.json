        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Coherent Corp. Fiscal Year 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations for Coherent Corp., Paul Silverstein.\nPaul Silverstein: Thank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. The call will be available for webcast replay on the Investor Relations section of our website. On the call, we have Coherent's Chair and CEO, Dr. Chuck Mattera, and a number of Coherent senior leaders, who Chuck will introduce shortly. This morning, we will devote majority of our time to answer questions from analysts and the investment community. Yesterday, after market close, we issued a press release, posted a shareholder letter and updated investor presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website and first these documents in a Form 8-K. This morning, we filed our 10-Q. The shareholder letter contains the financial statements historically included in our earnings press releases and detailed information regarding our operating performance, key trends and outlook. Before we begin, a short statement about forward-looking statements. We may make and/or refer to forward-looking statements, including statements about future performance and market outlook. Actual results may differ from those in the forward-looking statements. The shareholder letter and our SEC reports set forth risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their respective dates. During this call, we may discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. If we do, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the shareholder letter. If we present historical non-GAAP financial measures, we will limit our discussion to those that are reconciled in the shareholder letter. Before I turn the call over to Chuck for his opening remarks, please note that on March 26 at the Optical Fiber Conference, or OFC, in San Diego, we plan to host a meeting with the investment industry, which will be webcast, during which we will provide an update regarding our communications market. And in April of this year, we plan to host our third market overview webinar. It will be focused on our instrumentation market. The first two market webinars focused on our communications and industrial markets are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Coherent's Chair and CEO, Dr. Chuck Mattera.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Paul. It's a great day here in Silicon Valley, close to most of our largest customers. As I've said before, leadership development is among the CEO's most important responsibilities. Given the shareholder letters extensive disclosures, I have asked the following senior leaders who participate in the Q&A fireside on today's call: Rich Martucci, Interim Chief Financial Officer; Bob Bashaw, President; Dr. Giovanni Barbarossa, Chief Strategy Officer and President Materials segment; Sohail Khan, Executive Vice President Silicon Carbide LLC, our newly created subsidiary for our silicon carbide business; Dr. Chris Dorman, Executive Vice President, Lasers, who came to us through the Coherent acquisition; Magnus Bengtsson, Chief Commercial Officer who leads our global sales and service organization and who also came to us through the Coherent acquisition; Dr. Sanjai Parthasarathi, Chief Marketing Officer; and Dr. Julie Eng, Chief Technology Officer. As being among the industry's best, they will provide investors a rich source of information about the depth and breadth of our markets, technologies, operations and overall business. We emerged from the second quarter with greater confidence and excitement regarding a return to stronger growth and meaningfully enhanced profitability. For the quarter, we delivered solid sequential improvement in revenue and margins. The highlights of our second quarter include: healthy sequential increases in both gross and operating margin, ongoing AI driven strength in the datacom vertical of our communications market, signs of improving demand in all four verticals within our industrial market, and the telecom vertical of our communications market for the confirmation of the previously announced transactions with Mitsubishi Electric and DENSO Corporation, in which they invested in aggregate of $1 billion in our silicon carbide business and entered into long-term supply agreements supporting demand for silicon carbide substrates and epitaxial wafers; and five, an increase in our planned debt repayment in fiscal 2024, resulting from the Silicon Carbide LLC being able to fund its own operating and capital expenditures. While we expect that the higher revenue and the mix in our forecast will contribute to a rebound in margin structure, we are not waiting for improved end market demand to carry us. We've already implemented actions across virtually all of our businesses in a drive for enhanced operating efficiency. These actions, along with rigorous cost and expense control across the company, helped drive our sequential improvement in gross and operating margin in the second quarter. We are on a roll, but we're far from done. As we continue to transform the company to improve operating performance, we will optimize our production footprint and enhance operating resiliency while completing the integration of legacy Coherent. We also are exploring other strategic opportunities, not including material acquisitions to unlock shareholder value. Now for some numbers. While the macroeconomic environment continues to present challenges, we are pleased with our operating results for the quarter. We posted revenue of $1.131 billion, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.36, which was above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $67 million. We invested $91 million in capital equipment and we retired $89 million of debt. In addition to continuing to invest in our core assets, we are taking substantive actions to ensure we improve our resiliency and operating performance, especially to drive improvement in our margin structure, including through global integration and transformation and the realization of our synergy plan from the legacy Coherent acquisition, as well as our previously announced restructuring and consolidation plan. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 is as follows: revenue of approximately $1.12 billion to $1.20 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.32 to $0.52. And our updated guidance for fiscal 2024 is revenue of $4.55 billion to $4.70 billion, which represents a $50 million increase at the low end of our previous guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.70, which is up from $1 to $1.50 previously. Before we take your questions, I would like to say how appreciative and how proud I am of the senior leaders on this call and all of our other employees who started with dedication for setting the stage for what's now, next and beyond. Coherent is well-positioned with differentiated technology, exceptional talent and high-quality efficient manufacturing platforms capable of delivering products to markets that are rapidly growing. And I believe we are better positioned than others to take full advantage of our existing market positions and to penetrate deeper into these markets, largely because of the intimacy, trust and partnerships we have cultivated with market leaders and our increased scale, creating stability in our core business and creating a flywheel effect of other growth opportunities that many of our competitors simply don't have. In the upcoming years, we have tremendous upside potential and platform cost optimization attributable to the ongoing legacy Coherent integration, special restructuring and transformation projects that we've announced. We expect success given our proven track record and have a strong plan and road map in place, which will allow us to capitalize on the recovery and growth in our markets and of the broader market opportunities. We are endowed with a team of world-class technologists, industry pioneers and executives with a demonstrated capability for identifying and capitalizing on market mega trends. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul. Paul?\nPaul Silverstein: Thank you, Chuck. We will now open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question. This call is scheduled for an hour. With that, Carmen?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our first question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Congrats to the entire team there on the strong execution. Maybe just because it's one question, if I keep to datacom. In the shareholder letter, you referred to a number of new significant AI related customers that you have engagements with. If you can give us a bit more insight about the nature of those customers, the magnitude potentially of those engagements can turn into if you were to win those awards relative to the existing orders that you have. And then just a quick clarification. You did have 100% sequential growth in datacom, 800 gig revenue on capacity ramp, is that roughly where we should expect sort of capacity to linearly expand from here on? Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Yeah. Good morning, Samik. Thanks for your question. Sanjai?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Sure. Thanks for your question, Samik. So with any large scale deployment of new technology, there are a few hyperscalers drive it, and now we are seeing that to extend more broadly. We're also engaged with new MEMs as well as up and down the entire ecosystem. So we have a very broad group of customers that's continuing to grow in terms of engagements. Did that answer your question?\nSamik Chatterjee: Yeah. Anything on the capacity ramp, Sanjai?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: So in the capacity ramp, we did say in the shareholder letter that we grew 100%. That's basically our 800G shipments, 100% quarter-over-quarter. In our ramp up plans, we hit the quarterly -- we crossed the quarterly run rate of $100 million. And we also said that in fiscal '24, Samik, that over 50% of our datacom transceiver revenues will be from AI related applications. So we are really excited with the ramp and the growth of the market.\nChuck Mattera: And I'm expecting the third quarter will be greater than the second quarter and the fourth greater than the third, Samik. If that gives you any indication.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yeah. Sure. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel. Please proceed.\nRuben Roy: Thanks very much and I’ll echo my congrats to the team. A follow-up for my one question on networking as well. Chuck, just trying to understand the commentary around the supply constraints. It sounds like they improved, lead times are shortening. Would you say your -- the majority of the supply chain constraints are behind now and it's a question of shipping to demand or are there still some components that are out there that are in short supply? Is that kind of a limiting factor to the rest of the year on your AI transceiver shipments?\nChuck Mattera: Okay. Thanks a lot, Ruben. Ruben, as you know, anytime you go through such a steep ramp, what's lying in front of you with regard to constraints is what you're trying to get out in front of. So if you look in the rearview mirror, the constraints have surely eased and moderated. But when you see the size of the ramp that we're going up, we have to manage a number of constraints. The first constraint, then the second and third, we have to anticipate them. We have to get our agreements with suppliers in place. And we’re looking beyond FY ‘24. This is a super, super exciting and super-hot market. So we’re in the process of looking out well into FY ‘25 to be sure that our supply chain can keep up with us. I hope that answers your question, Ruben.\nRuben Roy: It does. Thank you for that detail chart.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions. Just one, just what are you seeing on inventory of under kind of this 800 gig or AI transceivers, just kind of when you expect some of the demand for that business to come back? And then just kind of on top of that, a couple of quarters ago, you had noted that you had a couple of hundred million of orders that if you ramp capacity, you expected to be able to fulfill during this fiscal year. Obviously, you guys are kind of ramping a little bit faster than expected just in terms of that kind of couple of hundred million that you outlined earlier in the year. Just how do you feel like you're going to be able to meet or exceed kind of those excess demand?\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Meta. Thanks for your interest. Sanjai?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Yeah. Thanks for your question, Meta. So our -- so we just said in our shareholder letter that we shipped over 100 million in 800G transceivers last quarter. It was much smaller the previous quarter, it grew almost 100% quarter-over-quarter. And then we also said, Meta, that in fiscal '24, 50% of our datacom transceiver revenues will be from AI related applications. So we are projecting a very strong growth in our 800G shipments. We are on a ramp-up, as Chuck referred to earlier. Hopefully, that answered your question.\nMeta Marshall: I guess -- but just in terms of what are you seeing in terms of inventory clearing on the kind of sub-800 gig versus -- I mean, I understand the 800-gig commentary, but what are we seeing just in terms of any other demand on the remainder of the business?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Okay. So we haven't factored in any huge rebound in the non-AI business in datacom. And that's one of the -- but most of the growth is in 800G. Pretty much all of the growth is in 800G. And that's why we said over 50% of our fiscal '24, our revenues will be from AI and related 800G products.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you.\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to as well talk about what's happening in 800-gig data center transceivers. And I'm looking for your thoughts on how you can compete in this market. And I'm struggling candidly because it seems like demand is great, which should be margin favorable, but some of your competitors probably are willing to take lower margins and so that might pressure profitability. Could you help us understand how you're thinking about that? Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Simon. Giovanni, would you like to give....\nGiovanni Barbarossa: Simon, good morning. Thanks for the question. Well, as a reminder, we are the most vertically integrated player in the space. So we heard, for example, people talking about shortage of pixels. Well, guess what, we have the largest bit supply in the world by far, so including obviously our competitors. So we have a very good kind of control of the supply line for the [indiscernible] components other than ICs. And we have our own manufacturing. We have pretty much the most complete offering in the space, both 100 and 200G as we announced in the past. So we think that will be very, very powerful, not only to remain competitive standpoint and a road map standpoint, which are very strategic to our hyperscale customers and the like, but also from a cost structure standpoint. We think that we will have always the best margin profile versus those that have to pretty much buy everything on the merchant market. So we are very active in many of these technologies that will be an advantage from a profitability standpoint.\nChuck Mattera: I would add, Simon -- thank you, Giovanni. I would add, Simon, that we have a full portfolio of products that we're making for today and developing for tomorrow. Those are going to be even more exciting than the ones we're making today. And for us, having full control, as Giovanni just described, our focus is on time to market, time to volume and time to profitability and that’s where it needs to stay. We have a track record. It is a competitive market, that’s for sure. We’re intending to compete.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Comes from the line of Jed Dorsheimer with William Blair. Please proceed.\nJed Dorsheimer: Hi. Thanks. Most questions seem to be on datacom so I'll be different in just, I guess, two part question. Maybe just an update on the -- I saw -- I think it's maybe the first time that I've seen you kind of highlight or call out. But on the MicroLED, could you just talk about the products of Coherent there that you're offering? And then on silicon carbide, there's been some cross currents of data points in the market. I'm just wondering if you might be able to update on -- so what you're seeing from the customer base there? Thanks.\nChuck Mattera: All right. Good morning, Jed. Thanks for your two questions. Chris will go first and then Sohail. Chris?\nChristopher Dorman: Yeah. Thanks, Chuck. Yeah. So we spoke about the MicroLED developments that we have in previous quarters and about the multiple orders we received from China, Taiwan and Korea for the tools for a process called laser-induced forward transfer, which is where you take the currently 10 micron moving towards 5 micron MicroLEDs from the wafer to the display. So we're seeing increasing customer engagement and are very excited about the impact of MicroLEDs on the television market. And this is a very high level of engagement now and a market that will be growing over the next three to five years.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Chris. Sohail?\nSohail Khan: Hello. Can you hear me?\nChuck Mattera: Yeah.\nSohail Khan: Thanks for your question. We are quite bullish about the silicon carbide market and the growth prospects over the next five to 10 years. And based upon that, we are sticking with our plan, which is driven from the customer engagement as well as long-term supply agreement which we had in place. The announcement with Mitsubishi and DENSO have strengthened our position, and we are seeing more engagements and especially a lot of interest from both existing and new customers for 200 millimeter. So we are going to stick to our plan of the investment and expansion, and we will continue to see the growth of our business quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nJed Dorsheimer: Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Sohail. Thanks, Jed.\nOperator: One moment for our next question, please. It comes from the line of Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nRichard Shannon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I'll ask a financial one here. It seems like after a couple of quarters of OpEx being flat to down, or I guess, a little bit more down on a pro forma basis, it seems like you're implying it growing here at a fairly steady rate here, which seems to be antithetical to the synergy and restructuring plan, I think, you announced one or two quarters ago. Can you help us understand why that is, why it might seem to be growing at a decent rate after bottoming out here?\nChuck Mattera: Thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. Rich will take it.\nRichard Martucci: So yeah, as you pointed out, our synergy plans and cost reduction has kept our expenses down in the OpEx. The big thing that you see in the ramp up as we go forward in the guidance really is around R&D around our AI product, as well as other initiatives that we have in place. So that's really the increase is coming from the R&D. We've done a really good job in our SG&A expenses.\nChuck Mattera: Look, those R&D investments in the second half of the year, Richard, are aimed for FY '25 and beyond on the basis of new information that we've received in the last one or two quarters from our customers with great clarity.\nRichard Shannon: Chuck, any way you'd want to characterize where those investments might sit, like by your segments or end markets or anything like that?\nChuck Mattera: In those markets that are growing extremely quickly, starting with AI, Richard. Everything starts with that.\nRichard Shannon: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks for the detail.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Richard. Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. It comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please proceed.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. As you indicated earlier on this call, VCSEL supply is critical right now on the ramp of both 800-gig and 1.6T transceivers. How has your internal capacity supported or helped your design wins for 1.6T, which you indicated will be ramping later on this year? And I guess if you could address that, perhaps could also discuss the ramp of 1.6T over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Karl, thanks for your question. Giovanni will take it. And if there's anything to add, that Julie would like to add to clarify, she will. Please, Giovanni.\nGiovanni Barbarossa: Thanks for the question. I mean, as we said earlier, we have our own facility. Actually, we have two facilities, two, three fabs that are capable of producing datacom. But at this point in time, we're relying on only one fab and it's ramping like needed by our internal customers and external customers too, which are our competitors. So as we said earlier, we have -- the advantage of being basically integrated to have a very a good understanding of the needs of the supply required by our -- both internal and external customers. So we have a full control of that. And we have had similar ramps in the past this is a challenging ramp in terms of the data rate. But nevertheless, I think we are doing a great job in keeping up with the demand both internal and external supplies. So at least we're shipping based on demand. We are not behind even if we still need to go as requested by the forecast. So we are following up with the demand as we see it right now. So we don't see that being a challenge at least for our VCSEL supply.\nChuck Mattera: Julie, would like to add regarding Karl's question on 1.6T.\nJulie Sheridan Eng: Right. Just to add to what Giovanni said is we also were one of the few in the industry actually that can make these very high speed. It's a unique capability.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks. Thank you for your question, Kar.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it's from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed.\nBlake Friedman: Hi. This is Blake Friedman on for Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. On gross margin, you provided a useful outline on actions to return to 40%. But can you maybe quantify all the different takes ranging from improving utilization, operational efficiencies and new products? And this goes back to a previous question, but on mix, just given the momentum in AI transceivers, are these products at or above the corporate average gross margin today?\nChuck Mattera: Okay. Good morning, Blake. Thanks. Rich?\nRichard Martucci: Yeah. So a two-part question. The first question is the AI. And I think in the last earnings call, we did mention that it is at the average of the -- corporate average in terms of margin. In terms of our ability to drive margin in the future, obviously, the first thing is volume, that's one. The second is utilization within our fabs, which really two of our six fabs have really improved in terms of the utilization and also the reliance of our synergy plan, the reliance of our restructuring plan is really going to be utmost of importance in terms of increasing our gross margin going forward.\nBlake Friedman: Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. One moment for our next question, please. It comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks for the question. Yeah. Can you hear me?\nChuck Mattera: Yes. Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Rolland: Hi. Great. Thanks for the question and congrats on the results. I just have one clarification and one question. First, the clarification, the primary gating issue on AI is 800 gig VCSELs. I just want to make sure whether I got that right or not. And then secondly, I wanted to talk about telco. So we're seeing more and more kind of weak data points coming out for telco, but it kind of feels like maybe you're going to tell us that could be in the rearview mirror for you guys. So is December the clear bottom there? Are you expecting to kind of grow through the year here? And what -- where can we kind of normalize out on a quarterly run rate for telecom looking forward? Thanks.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, Chris. So Giovanni will clarify your question regarding VCSELs Magnus will take the telecom question. Giovanni?\nGiovanni Barbarossa: Yes. So the -- let me clarify, try to be clear. No, it's not, okay? So we don't have a challenge from a supply standpoint from the VCSEL standpoint. Of course, when you ramp a production of transceiver modules, there's a number of other things that need to happen, including tests, automation of assembly lines, new processes. And of course, there is also external supply chain, particularly around ICs, that will impact our ability to ramp. So everything is coming together. And based on the demand -- the demand is definitely stronger than what we could supply. We are capacity-limited but not necessarily from a device standpoint, but just as an overall ability to ramp to the volumes that we have been held by supplies by the -- by our customers in terms of the most recent forecast versus previous forecast. We are realigned with road maps. We know exactly what the customers are looking for, for next-generation products. And so we will adapt our internal supply chain to keep up with the demand. Currently, we don't have experience -- going back to your first question, we don't experience a challenge from a VCSEL production standpoint. And I want also to recall that we have capacity -- superior capacity for both internal and external suppliers. So we don't -- we can manage that as we need to support our own transceiver business, obviously, as a priority (ph).\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Giovanni. Magnus, would you take the telecom question?\nMagnus Bengtsson: Sure. Good morning, Chris. So in telecom, we saw growth in the December quarter over the October quarter by about 20%. And if we look out for the balance of the fiscal year, we expect double-digit growth second half over first half. And beyond that, in '25, as the market improves we expect additional growth, both from the market coming back but also a lot of the engagement we have with customers on design wins for new products.\nChuck Mattera: Great. Thanks, Magnus. Thanks for your question, Chris.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thanks. One moment for our next question. It comes from the line of Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed.\nMark Miller: Thank you for the question and congrats on your progress. Just was wondering in terms of new applications for VCSELs in terms of automotive and other applications. What are you looking at over the next 12 months or so?\nChuck Mattera: Great. Good morning, Mark. Julie, will you take that one?\nJulie Sheridan Eng: Sure. Yes. So VCSELs in addition to the datacom market, it can be used in the sensing market. Obviously, we’re in the sensing world and mobile phone application. And then in addition to that, you can use VCSELs for all kind of other sensing, including in a vehicle, potentially in health applications, so many potential future applications of VCSELs in sensing.\nMark Miller: Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Julie. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Comes from the line of Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nTim Savageaux: Hi. Good morning. Again, sorry if I might have missed this earlier. But you talked about 800 gig transceiver shipments at about 100 million in the quarter kind of doubling sequentially. Do you have an outlook for where you expect that number to go either in fiscal Q3 or by year end? And I'll follow up from there. Thanks.\nChuck Mattera: Yeah. Okay, Tim. Thanks for your question. Tim, what we said that you have missed is what I said is I expect our shipments in Q3 to be greater than Q2 and in Q4 greater than Q3. We're on a ramp. It's going up and to the right.\nTim Savageaux: Okay. Well, if I might maybe follow up on that a little bit. I mean, you're talking about fairly modest sequential growth here for Q3 and growth in telecom. So I guess, are you looking for -- and even if you look at your Q2 results, it seems like the lower speed stuff might have come down pretty good. So you're seeing some offsets there. Is sort of that the dynamic for overall datacom revenue or what are the puts and takes as -- or is that ramp slowing a bit, I guess, from the [Multiple Speakers]\nChuck Mattera: It really is an insightful question. Meta Marshall had the same question and Sanjai tried to address it. Let's let him take another pass at it.\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Okay. So thanks for the question, Tim. Good morning. So in terms of the market, the market -- the fastest growing segment of the market is 800G and above, which is really AI. We just redid our forecast, it's growing at a 65% CAGR in the next five years, Tim. So it's a very sharply growing market and we expect -- we aim to grow faster than that market. Now the traditional networking market is certainly not growing at that clip, and we are not really factoring a significant rebound in our non-AI, if you will, market growth or our revenue growth. So a lot of our revenue growth is coming from AI-related applications. Hopefully, that's clear.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Sanjai.\nTim Savageaux: Thanks, appreciate it.\nChuck Mattera: Yeah. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And it's from Ananda Baruah, Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please proceed.\nAnanda Baruah: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong execution. Yeah, actually, just a follow-up there, Sanjai, clarification. Is that the -- I guess, what is 65% growth over the next five years specifically?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Hi, Ananda. Good morning. It is the growth of 800G and above transceivers, datacom trounces from calendar '23 to calendar '28. It's at a 65% cap.\nAnanda Baruah: I got it. Super helpful. And I guess my question is, any way to think about yet the transceiver opportunity for genAI outside of the hyperscale complex? And so specifically, I'm thinking at telcos and on-premise, say, like Fortune 1000 sites. And that's it for me\nChuck Mattera: Okay. Good morning, Ananda. Julie will take the next one.\nJulie Sheridan Eng: All right. Good morning, Ananda. Yeah. So the -- obviously, the biggest deployments are the biggest web scale. And as time goes on that spreads out, as you point out, to other smaller entities that could either host services or people may choose to have their services on-premise to that diversified customer base, similar actually to the Ethernet market. And then -- so the genAI -- I forgot the second part of the question.\nPaul Silverstein: With regard to -- will it spill over to telecom.\nJulie Sheridan Eng: Thank you. Yes, eventually, it all spills over to telecom because all that data that's getting generated inside has to go somewhere. So we do believe that, that will impact our telecom revenue in a positive way over time should impact eventually also non-AI datacom revenue. And then finally, something that might not be so direct of a comparison, but these genAI chips require the most advanced process nodes, and that's beneficial to our industrial segment for our semi-cap inspection lasers.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Julie. Ananda, I would add that besides datacom and telecom verticals, we have a semi-cap equipment business, and it’s also underpinning the growth in AI by providing new tools, including laser-based tools and engineered material tools to OEMs that have to build the equipment to make the devices. I mean, we have it surrounded.\nAnanda Baruah: Yeah. That’s anomaly. Great. Job.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Ananda.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it's from the line of Dave Kang with B. Riley. Please proceed.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning, Dave.\nDave Kang: Thank you. Good morning. A question is on ARM lasers. Chuck, I think you talked about it in the past that as ARM lasers has an 8-figure opportunity and could reach 9 figures if you successfully penetrate the Chinese market. Just wondering if you can give us an update there.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Dave. Thanks for asking about one of our other super exciting opportunities. Giovanni?\nGiovanni Barbarossa: Yeah, Dave. Thanks for the question. Yeah. We're making a progress. Actually just recently, we learned that major battery maker in China kind of displaced our competitor laser to replace it with ours on the production line. So we think it's going to be a huge opportunity for gold, since it's one of the largest battery makers in the world. So we think in addition to the existing customers they keep ramping production, you see the major advantage of the spot-free, no-porosity kind of well quality provided by our ARM laser people, we believe that to grow in the market space. And it's not going to be limited just to batteries for EVs. I think we're seeing application beyond that, not only in the automotive market, but for example, in the semi cap equipment market, we have been engaged recently on working on some advanced lithography tools to provide laser welding for some special alloys parts that are needed by those tools.\nChuck Mattera: Dave, we’re aiming to drive a paradigm shift when it comes to laser building.\nDave Kang: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please proceed.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning, Jim.\nJames Ricchiuti: Hi, Chuck. I wonder if you could elaborate on the comment early on in the shareholder letter that you would consider other strategic opportunities to unlock shareholder value. I'm wondering what that means. Are you suggesting that you might pursue some smaller M&A to maybe expand in some areas that you may not necessarily have the presence you want to have?\nChuck Mattera: Jim, that's a great question. We're from time to time, asked about it. We are prudent stewards of our capital. And let me ask Bob Bashaw, our President, if he'd like to remark.\nBob Bashaw: Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I'm happy to, Chuck. Yes, as you know, we have been open to all kinds of transactions in the history of the company. And we are with great partners, and as Chuck said, shareholder value is always our driver. So we are actively, like we have been for 51 years, considering lots of alternatives to grow shareholder value. As we indicated in the shareholder letter, these are probably going to be smaller transactions, not material, but that is our focus across all range of potential transactions.\nJames Ricchiuti: Is it a case of expanding in some areas that you're underserved? Is that the focus?\nBob Bashaw: Well, for sure. There's -- if you look at all the technologies and the opportunities we have, there are a lot of corners that we can look in for areas to grow. There's also tremendous opportunities to partner. So we have -- we are considering all of those options and have active engagements in those areas.\nJames Ricchiuti: Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our last question, please. And it comes from the line of Mike Genovese with Rosenblatt Securities.\nMichael Genovese: All right. Good morning. And I guess, I'll go to beating the dead horse here. When I parse your comments on 800G as a percentage of datacom transceivers this year, I end up somewhere in the range of revenue should be 70% to 150% higher than the $300 million you talked about entering the year. And so with that as the preamble, my two-part question is, are we still looking at 20% of the revenues being in the first half of the year and 80% in the second half of the year like you guys said last quarter or is that sort of -- has that changed a little bit? And then secondly, just as we look at fiscal '25, should we put Sanjai's CAGR, which I think he said was 55%, if I heard that right? Is that roughly the right way to think about where we start for fiscal '25 growth in that business? Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Okay, Sanjai?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Yeah. Thanks, Chuck. Good morning, Mike. So, I think our revenue pattern is pretty much in line with what you stated in terms of our growth rate. Obviously, we are going to -- we are aiming to do even better than that in terms of the second half of the fiscal year.\nChuck Mattera: And I remind you, it is 65% is a five year CAGR. So maybe just keep that in mind, Mike.\nMichael Genovese: Sorry, but I'm just -- I guess, 20-80 though, is that we're still targeting 20-80, that hasn't flattened out a little bit because of the good performance in 2Q? It's still 20-80?\nChuck Mattera: It’s close to that, maybe a little bit higher than 20 and a little lower than 80, but that’s roughly right.\nMichael Genovese: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. You got a great job. Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A session. I will turn it back to Paul Silverstein for any final comments.\nPaul Silverstein: Thank you, Carmen. I want to thank all the analysts on the call for their thoughtful questions. And I want to thank all of you on the line for having joined us this morning. We look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Coherent Corp. FY ‘24 First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Paul Silverstein. Please go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today on the call, we have Chairman and CEO, Dr. Chuck Mattera; and a number of executives who Chuck will introduce in a moment. Yesterday after the market closed, Coherent issued a news release and posted a shareholder letter along with an updated investor presentation in the investor relations section of our website. Both of these documents were furnished on a Form 8-K. This morning we filed their 10-Q. Today's conference call will be available for webcast replay in the investor relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Chuck for his opening remarks, please note that following our September overview webinar on our communications market, we plan on hosting our second market overview webinar focused on our industrial market to be held on December 14th. I want to call everyone's attention to our shareholder's letter, which contains our traditional financial statements that were previously set forth in our earnings press release, along with detailed information around our operating performance, key trends, and outlook. We plan to do both of this morning's call to answering questions from analysts in the investment community. I also want to remind everyone on this call we will refer to forward-looking statements, including all statements the company will make about its future performance and market outlook and actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in the first quarter 2024 shareholder letter and in our SEC reports. Coherent assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their respective dates. Also during this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the shareholder letter. With respect to historical non-GAAP financial measures, we will limit our discussion to those that are reconciled in the shareholder letter. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Coherent Chair and CEO, Dr. Chuck Mattera. Chuck, please go ahead.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Paul. Leadership development is among the most important jobs of the CEO. Given how extensive our disclosures are in the shareholder letter, I have the following senior leaders with me on the call today. They are Interim Chief Financial Officer, Rich Martucci; Chief Strategy Officer and President of the Materials Segment, Dr. Giovanni Barbarossa; EVP of Lasers, Dr. Chris Dorman, who came to us through the Coherent acquisition; Sohail Khan, EVP of our Wide-Bandgap Technologies Silicon Carbide business; our Chief Commercial Officer, Magnus Bengtsson, who leads our global sales and service org and who also came to us through the Coherent acquisition; Chief Marketing Officer, Dr. Sanjai Parthasarathi, and EVP of our Telecommunications Business Dr. Beck Mason, a recent market hire and one of the industry's top leaders, who chose to come to Coherent as a place to grow. They will participate in the Q&A fireside today to provide investors a rich source of information about the depth and breadth of our markets, technologies, operations, and overall business, and especially our leadership talent. And I'm sure you'll enjoy interacting with them today. In the first quarter, the Coherent team did a good job executing in the midst of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We posted revenue of $1.053 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $199 million, which marked sequential and year-over-year improvement. We invested $62 million in capital equipment and we retired $19 million of debt. Macroeconomic headwinds and uncertainty continue to affect many of our end markets and will continue to constrain our near-term growth and visibility. Our first quarter results, however, demonstrate the success of our diversification strategy. While some of our markets remain challenged, our silicon carbide business, in which we recently announced $1 billion of investments by Mitsubishi Electric and DENSO, enjoyed another quarter of strong demand. We also enjoyed a second straight quarter of extremely strong demand for our AI-related datacom transceivers and components. Both of these are indicative of the breadth and differentiation we offer the market leaders for disrupting the status quo and underpinning the irreversible market megatrends that we enable. In addition to continuing to invest in our core assets, we are taking substantive actions to ensure that we improve our operating performance, especially to drive recovering in our margin structure, including through global integration and transformation and the realization of our synergy plan from the coherent acquisition, as well as our previously announced restructuring activities. Turning now to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal ‘24, revenue of approximately $1.05 billion to $1.175 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.14 to $0.32. Our guidance for fiscal year ‘24 is revenue of approximately $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion, which is unchanged from our previous guidance, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1 to $1.50, which is also unchanged from our previous guidance. And while our annual guidance remains unchanged, this simply reflects the confidence we have in that guidance and we continue to believe that we still have very real opportunities to exceed those results by several hundred million dollars as we discussed last quarter. We will not hesitate to increase our outlook as we gain improved visibility regarding our ability to capitalize on these opportunities within fiscal year ‘24. Now before we turn to your questions, I would like to say how appreciative and proud I am of our employees whose tireless dedication for setting the stage for now, next, and beyond. Coherent is well positioned with differentiated technology, exceptional talent, and high quality, efficient manufacturing platforms capable of delivering products to the market that are growing at high-single-digits to double-digits. And I believe that we are better positioned than others to take full advantage of our existing market positions and to grow deeper into these markets, because of our growing scale and customer intimacy and trust. We are a trusted and valued partner with the industry leaders and that trust and intimacy creates stability in our core business and it also creates a flywheel effect of growth opportunities that many other companies simply don't have. We have tremendous upside and platform cost optimization from the ongoing integration, special restructuring, and transformation projects over the next few years. And we have a track record to prove our likelihood of success. We have a good plan and roadmap to take advantage of all of these assets and the opportunity the markets are offering today and to take advantage of the recovery and anticipated growth in our markets. We have a team of world-class technologists, industry pioneers, and executives with a demonstrated capability for identifying and capitalizing on market megatrends. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul. Paul?\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks, Chuck. We will now open the call to analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] Please direct your questions to Chuck who will decide who is best to respond. Kevin, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChuck Mattera: Hey, good morning, Samik.\nOperator: If your phone line is muted, could you please unmute the line?\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Can you hear me now, Chuck? Yes, I can hear you.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning, Samik.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes, good morning, Chuck. Thank you for the comments. And if I can just start, I mean, last quarter you did talk about, and you referenced this in the shareholder letter as well, the capacity increase or the capacity ramp that you're planning and the incremental orders that you can get from the customers, if your capacity ramp goes full plan or exceeds your current base case. If you can share your thoughts around the ability to sort of exceed that capacity ramp. What are you seeing as bottlenecks and the ability to go to customers and get incremental orders for the AI -- from the AI use cases and the 800G Transceivers in relation to sort of executing on that capacity ramp, and I have a follow-up after that. Thanks.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, thank you, Samik. Samik, I'm going to ask Giovanni to take that because he's got a view all the way from the laser through the transceiver. Giovanni?\nGiovanni Barbarossa: So, hey Samik, thanks for the question. So, I would say, generally speaking, we're doing better than our expectations, but it's very much a moving target in terms of the opportunity here, in the sense that the target's getting higher and higher, as particular as we said in the shareholders' letter, as the engagement with new, significant AI players are increasing, particularly those players that we have not been historically strong at. So we think that the overall opportunity is getting larger and our ability to meet this larger and larger opportunity obviously gets more complex, more challenging, but I think we have the all hands on deck and the entire team is focused on several of the needs to ramp, which are not only related to the supply chain, because as new products, and this is a, as you know, 800G is a very much new product, there are all these MPI-related challenges to bring up to speed, you know, the manufacturing lines, the test equipment, the, you know, of course, supply chain, as we said, but most important to make sure that we deliver high quality products to our customers the volumes that are replacing us to ramp.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. And so for my follow-up, if I can just ask about the long-term guidance that you gave in the shareholder letter about 40% gross margin and 20% operating margin that you're looking at. Can you share some thoughts about, how you're thinking about getting -- make progress to that in relation to cost versus what you need in terms of top line recovery to get to those margin levels? Any thoughts around how much of that we get from cost saves that you're outlining versus any level of volume recovery that you need? Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Samik. Rich?\nRich Martucci: Thank you. We will benefit from ongoing class reductions, which include our restructuring and synergy plans, higher volume as noted in our guidance, better mix of product on higher margin products, and long-term continued leverage -- to leverage our NPI, as well as vertical integration where we can drive margin improvement.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking the call.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Samik.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel. Your line is open.\nRuben Roy: Yes, thank you for letting me ask some questions. I wanted to follow-up on Samik’s question, Chuck, and talk about just sort of the AI transceiver, NPI launches, the delta between sort of your full-year guidance and sort of what you're holding back? Love to hear some details outside of the supply constraints. Sounds like there's some qualification milestones needed. Is that product specific, customer specific? If you could give us some details on, how you expect those qualifications to ramp near-term and what's left to be done before you actually start, kind of, seeing some revenues?\nChuck Mattera: Yes. Thank you, Ruben. Giovanni?\nGiovanni Barbarossa: Thanks for the question. I mean, the -- as we said earlier, new products generally require an incubation period in the manufacturing line to reach the quality, the yields, the performance that we promised. So those are generally true for any product. This 800G is significantly more challenging than any other product we had before that came to the, kind of, this same type of market. So I think the complexity comes from the fact that while we are ramping for the orders that we already have, we're also engaging, as I said, new players in a meaningful way to further extend our opportunity in the near future. And therefore, eventually CEO as Chuck mentioned in his remarks, to see an upside for the overall market that we can address. So it's a combination of serving needs that we have short-term versus the needs to continue to increase the pipeline, the funnel of new opportunities for 800G with additional customers beyond those that we're already engaged with.\nRuben Roy: Thanks, Giovanni, for the detail. For my follow-up, on telecom, data points remain pretty negative. And nice to hear you guys talk about bottom here coming out of September quarter. Can you give us some details on what you're thinking in terms of, it sounds like inventory's driving some of your view for the rest of the year, but starting in the December quarter, if you can give us any detail on how you're thinking about that business, whether it's market share or what's driving your view on a recovery, starting here near-term, however gradual that might be?\nChuck Mattera: Beck?\nBeck Mason: Yes, sure. I think in the telecom softness, it's a combination of end market softness and inventory digestion at our customers. And we've been staying very, very close to our customer base on this. And we see progress modestly coming through FY ‘24 and the rest of the quarters on their inventory digestion. And then we see gradual improvement in the end market demand really progressing through the FY ‘25.\nRuben Roy: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe just on growth margins, was the weakness versus expectations on a mix of categories or just, you know, are there any higher costs that are needing to be paid to kind of clear some of the 800 gig transceiver bottlenecks to be mindful of? And then maybe just as a second question, just any more clarity on how you guys are thinking about debt repayment in fiscal ‘24? Thanks.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, Meta. Rich?\nRich Martucci: Yes. So the margin of weakness is a result of separate factors. One was the -- is the lower volume that we incurred in the quarter. Unfavorable mix are the main key drivers. However, as well, we did experience prior period underutilization that hit the P&L as well. For debt reduction, right now we're anticipating $200 million of pay down for the year.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSimon Leopold: Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to get a bit of a clarification type question here in that, unlike last quarter's shareholder letter, and by the way, we like the way you're doing this, it's helpful. This one did not mention explicitly several hundred million of AI-related datacom sales in the outlook. And I'm just wondering how you'd like us to interpret that exclusion versus the prior quarter's letter? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nChuck Mattera: All right. Simon, thanks for your question. I'd like to get us back to basics. We have the guidance. The guidance is the guidance. I made some additional comments this morning to give a sense that we're still aiming to do more. But I don't want to get us into a mode where we're going to have guidance and then guidance on top of the guidance. So we just want to get us back to the basics. That's what we're doing. And as I indicated today, we might have some upside to it that we can achieve. For sure, we have upside as an opportunity. Okay?\nSimon Leopold: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of this AI pipeline of business, I'm just wondering if you could help us bracket how much of this is hyperscale exposure? And how much of it is non-hyperscale? And what I'm getting at is trying to understand a little bit about the customer mix and concentration of the pipeline. Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: It's a -- Sanjay will take that, Simon. I can tell you, it grows every day. Sanjay?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Yes, thanks Chuck. So last quarter, Simon, we did 60% of our business came from hyperscalers, and this is both direct, as well as indirect sales into hyperscalers. Does that help?\nSimon Leopold: Thank you. Yes it does. I guess I'm wondering about the pipeline is more so than the most recent quarter.\nSanjai Parthasarathi: So our pipeline is still pretty strong. We expect to -- in fiscal ‘25, for example, we believe that 80% of our datacom transceiver revenues will be from hyperscalers. A lot of it, majority of it is -- vast majority of it driven by AI/ML.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much. Appreciate that.\nChuck Mattera: Simon, thank you for your feedback too on the letter.\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Thanks, Simon.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jed Dorsheimer with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJed Dorsheimer: Hi. Thanks for taking my question here, guys. I guess, first question, just want to shift from, you know, most of the others around the 800G and just on some of your comments around the consolidation in compound semis, you mentioned this, one if you could give a little bit more color on maybe metric fab. And then two, on the new product introduction, you talked about reducing or improving cycle times. Could you talk about where they're at now and where you hope to get those to. Thanks.\nGiovanni Barbarossa: Okay, thanks. This is Giovanni here, so thanks for the question. So we -- when we acquired Finisar, we acquired a number of wafer fabs, which at that time were pretty much fully utilized and as we were able to transfer products and manufacturing lines between sites and so forth, we were able to identify ultimately what the best footprint for the compound semiconductor manufacturing for the company was going to be. So that's what we are basically doing now because we couldn't do it that fast. So now what we're doing, we are -- we have announced several shutdowns of smaller fabs, and we intend to move and integrate those manufacturing lines into our largest fab, which is in Sherman, Texas. So there was a footprint. We still have some other fabs between Europe and North America there will still stay with the standalone, because the cost of moving those product lines will be too high. And also, we'll require a lot of e-qualifications that we cannot, we don't see it advantage in moving those product lines. But at least for the gallium arsenide particularly the gallium arsenide, VCSEL-based type of powders, in some of the indium phosphide-based products, we ultimately decided that Sherman, Texas would be our center of excellence. Our consolidated [Technical Difficulty].\nChuck Mattera: I'll take the second part, Jed. Thanks for your question with regard to MPI cycle times. I would say one thing I think you know that we're built for speed. This place is organized for a great sense of urgency about everything we do. One of the benefits we have with our global footprint is we can do things 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That's not so easy for everybody else to say. I would tell you that I can't give you a baseline generically, because we have so many platforms and so many products in the company, but I will point out that using AI in this last year, our teams have demonstrated a factor of two reduction in the cycle time for launching new products from our fiber laser business. And that is going to be a contagious example that goes around the company. I think that AI is going to be a great driver, but it's not the only thing that we need to do. And so a factor of two everywhere is a starting point for the mindset of the management team. Okay?\nJed Dorsheimer: Got it. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, on the silicon carbide business, we are seeing greater restrictions on raw materials from China. And I'm just wondering, graphite is an important component to both the furnaces, as well as the input material. Could you just update on supply chain exposure and if any in terms of how you see specific to graphite? Thanks.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Jed. Hey, Sohail, are you out there?\nSohail Khan: Yes, yes. Jed, thanks for your question. First answer is no, we don't have the exposure. We have multi-sourced for both this material and the other components. And we have put in place long-term agreements. And none of our graphite suppliers have the basics coming from China.\nJed Dorsheimer: That's helpful. Thank you, Sohail.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Jed.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nRichard Shannon: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. I'll also echo my happiness with the shareholder. Keep it up, please. I'm going to follow-up on the topic of telecom. I guess one of the questions I had, looking at some reports here in earning season so far, including last night, we were seeing some inventory burns still taking place at the equipment level here. I'm wondering why you're seeing some start of a pickup here. And to the degree to which you can describe it, how much of this recovery is coming from transceiver type products like ZR that you point out to shareholder with the letter versus things like WSSs and ROADMs?\nChuck Mattera: So thanks for the question. So right now I think what we're seeing is a little bit more strength on the WSS and the ROADM, the amplifier and that portion of the business. And it's really as our customers are burning down inventory right now, we're starting to see different product lines there have a small pickup this quarter and we think that's going to continue to double-digits for the second-half of FY ‘24. Our transceiver-based products, we see a lot of design and activity happening right now. There's a lot of RFQs and RFPs, especially for new technology products like our 100 gig Coherent ZR and there's an increase in RFP activity around 800 gig, which is coming next year. And so we think that's very positive for that segment, but we think that's going to be more delayed towards the latter half of FY ‘24 and early FY ‘25 from a ramp perspective. Does that help provide a little more color?\nRichard Shannon: Yes, that does. Thanks for that. My follow-on question will be in the display market. I think you talked about service utilization that have increased here sequentially, I think even a nice 20% number if I remember correctly, but still below your year ago levels here. Wonder if you have any visibility into those utilizations continuing to improve and perhaps even get back to year ago levels and then does this imply or just give you better visibility on further CapEx orders within the display unit?\nChuck Mattera: Good morning Richard, thank you very much. Chris Dorman?\nChris Dorman: Yes, in display the utilization of the OLED tools drives the service revenue. And it's worth remembering that there are two factors in terms of the utilization. It's the number of phone screens that are produced. But there's a multiplying factor in terms of the percentage of phones, which are using OLED screens and that is led to an uptick in the service revenue, the utilization of the Excimer lasers and that will continue through the year.\nRichard Shannon: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSidney Ho: Great, thank you. Good morning. I want to switch gears over to the industrials market. You seem quite confident that the business will improve in the second-half of fiscal ‘24. Can you talk about which subsegments do you think will lead to recovery between semi-cap display, precision, manufacturing, and aerospace? Particularly interested in your comments in Precision Manufacturing, you're seeing second conservative order of growth, and some customers are requesting shipments on short notice, but that's quite different than what we are hearing from other broad-based semiconductor companies?\nChuck Mattera: Okay, Sidney, good morning. This is Chuck. Sidney, we may have two or three people that have an angle on this, but we'll start with Sanjay.\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Yes, thanks, Chuck. So in terms of our industrial market group is broken up into verticals, so we have our precision manufacturing vertical, our semi-cap vertical, our display vertical, and aerospace and defense. We are really excited about semi-cap. That market for us has been growing very steadily, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So there is -- we continue to see a lot of demand both from existing customers and new customers and the envelope of applications seem to continue to improve. On precision manufacturing in particular, that is a market that is a lot more sensitive to macro. However, we do have certain areas of very strong growth, such as electric vehicles, so our stock market's growing at a 15% CAGR, the medical device market is turning around, that's growing also fairly well. So we've got some really big bright spots within precision manufacturing. And I think Chris covered the display question earlier.\nChuck Mattera: Do you want to add anything to that, Chris?\nChris Dorman: Yes, I would say that semiconductor, capital equipment inspection is also showing growth. It remains strong. Our customers continue to pull on a strong backlog there.\nChuck Mattera: Great. Okay, Sidney.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great. That's helpful. My follow-up question, though, I just want to follow-up on the silicon carbide. You called the near-term demand for the silicon carbide business remains pretty robust, but recent data points from the industry seems to be more mixed in the past few weeks with demand for EVs maybe slowing down a little bit. Can you give us a sense what you are seeing in terms of demand? Is that you are doing better than others, because you're gaining share? And also interested to see how the pricing side of things are? Are you seeing more competition in terms of prices? Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you Sidney. Hi Sohail.\nSohail Khan: Okay. Sidney, that we have to look at the market not by one quarter basis, because this is a market which is on a growth trajectory. And it is going to continue to grow at close to 30% compounded growth rate over next five to 10 years. So one announcement of one vendor pushing in and out does not define the market. Overall market strength is there and the market adoption is there. And yes, when you have the growth and many players are coming in, that there will be price pressure. It is normal, natural in any growth market. But we see a strong growth and a very good traction with very large customers with the long-term agreements in place.\nSidney Ho: Okay, thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Sidney.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBlake Freeman: Hi, this is Blake Freeman on Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to go back to your AI opportunity, I know one of your competitors recently made an acquisition to enter the AI data cloud transceiver space. First, was hoping you can provide any clarity on the margin generator from higher speed AI-related transceiver products? And if you think this growing competition also creates any pricing risk in the market?\nChuck Mattera: Thanks for the question. First of all the -- clearly this validates the investment thesis we had for the acquisition of Finisar years ago, so we had that vision, which is now you can see was a pretty good one. And then it enforces, right, the -- it's an endorsement, it reinforces the strength of the market that we are witnessing today and the upside potential that we all see. I think the generally speaking, from vertical integration, scale, and technology differentiation, we are still the market leaders and that's explained why we see the funnel, the pipeline for new engagement around 800G increasing daily in the sense that we believe that we have an opportunity, that maybe we have not considered in the recent past to penetrate hyperscalers where we have been historically not as strong as we would have liked to be. And so generally speaking, the competitiveness of the landscape is there. I think we welcome competition and I think we are very well positioned with the three attributes, which I mentioned to compete and continue to grow and take advantage of the, again, as I said, of the strategy which we deployed years ago when we identified AI on demand as being a key driver for the growth of our business.\nBlake Freeman: Got it, and then just as a follow-up on the silicon carbide side, I know there's certainly a supply demand imbalance in the market. Just trying to get your thoughts around as there's more device vendors in the market, who are kind of bringing materials production in-house. How we should think about the growth opportunities for Coherent and I guess, your thoughts on the relative growth in the materials market versus the device market longer term?\nChuck Mattera: Okay, thanks for your question. So, Sohail?\nSohail Khan: Yes. We see a demand on both ends that even you say there are lots of suppliers in the Dubai site, people are still looking for a good MOSFET, a MOSFET which will be rugged, MOSFET which will have high reliability and MOSFET, which can address the future needs, which are getting more and more integration and the amount of current and power you can handle. So we see a very strong demand on the device side from our customer engagements. And then on the material side that we see a very strong demand for 200 millimeter and in 200 millimeter there are very few limited choices and as you know we were the first one to introduce the 200 product to the marketplace. So, we feel pretty good about it. Yes, there is competition, but competition reaffirms that there is a strong demand for it.\nBlake Freeman: Great, thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey guys, congrats on the results and guidance and thanks for the question. I guess my question is around backlogs. So that's now increased two quarters in a row. Is this a sign, you guys think of the bottoms, does this mean we can grow revenue each quarter as we move through next year? Or are there some decent timing and fulfillment issues here in this backlog that would disturb that kind of linear pattern?\nChuck Mattera: Okay, thanks a lot Chris. Good morning. Chris, I'm going to ask Magnus just to make a general comment about the overall pulse from the marketplace as he sees it from the point of view of the demand. And we'll see if there's a follow-up.\nMagnus Bengtsson: Good morning, Chris. Appreciate the question. So let me just talk a little bit about the customer engagement perhaps. I would say that customer engagement is really robust and we see orders continuing to grow across the end market. Customers today, there's certainly the inventory digestion issues we mentioned with some of our end markets, but customers are really focused on innovation. And so the design wind funnel, the outlook that we have looks very robust across most of our markets. So we would expect that trend to continue.\nChristopher Rolland: Great. Thank you. Perhaps as a follow-up to someone else's question, did you guys get to take a look at the Cloud Light deal, or did you guys get to look at the Intel Cifo sale to [Indiscernible], and were any of these deals interesting or perhaps in your opinion threatening in any way either? Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, Chris. Giovanni do you want to take that?\nGiovanni Barbarossa: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. No, we were not engaged. You know, we don't need pretty much a contract manufacturer to be added to our existing manufacturing lines. So we believe that, as I said earlier, we welcome the competition. We think it's the combination will definitely be a stronger competitor. So we endorse that, but as I said earlier, it's also an endorsement to our strategy, which we deployed years ago to be in this market at this time, be leader with a larger scale and the largest -- broadest portfolio of differentiated components and sub-assemblies for -- to serve this market.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Giovanni.\nChristopher Rolland: Looks like a nice [Technical Difficulty]. Thanks, Giovanni.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Chris. Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Tom O’Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTom O’Malley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one on the segments. So in your $4.6 billion guide for the year, could you give us a little more color on what you expect a comm business to do and then more specifically within the comm business, what you're expecting the telecom business to do and what the data comm business will do? I ask because there's obviously some big movements inside of the telecom and data comm business, and I'm just trying to get a little better feel for what you guys expect for growth last year . Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, Tom, good morning. We're not going to give business unit guidance, and I think Rich can just make a general overall comment. I think at the midpoint, we're up 11% in the second-half, compared to the first-half. There's some puts and takes across the segments. You want to say anything else, Rich about it?\nRich Martucci: No, that's right on.\nChuck Mattera: Okay. If you have any specific question about the telecom market, Beck can take it, but he's not going to give you guidance in the second-half of the year.\nTom O’Malley: Sure, I guess just the trend looks as though the high-speed data comm business looks as though it's the big driver of growth. Could you talk about, historically, you guys have said that within your comm business, the transceiver business is below corporate gross margins. In these new products, particularly in 800G, are you seeing a creative gross margins with those new higher speed products or are those still below corporate gross margins? Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, this is a good question. Well, Rich will take it, but I would say at the launch point with all the things that we have going on, what we were at today, we're driving to improve is just a general comment for the company. We have lots of flywheels turning inside the company all the way from the front end fabs where we're still adding capacity to be able to keep pace not with FY ‘24 demand although that's a challenge because it keeps going up, but especially because we believe FY ‘25 is going to be that much more exciting. Rich, make a general comment about the margins, if you would.\nRich Martucci: Sure. So on the margins, the average is about where we are at as a company, but we fully expect as we go through the learning curve that the margins will increase going forward.\nChuck Mattera: Yes.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nMark Miller: Thank you for the question.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Miller: I'm doing fine. Good morning. I just wanted to pursue a little more from your guidance, it looks like you're projecting improvements in margins going forward. You listed several things in your letter to shareholders. Is that being driven by higher revenues? I guess I have a similar concern about transceivers in terms of the, they being accreted to overall margins, especially when you're seeing strong growth there? So I'm just wondering what's driving the expectations for higher margins? Is it just higher sales or mix?\nRich Martucci: I'll take that. This is Rich. Thank you. So as I mentioned before, our ongoing cost reduction, including our synergy and restructuring plans and higher volume, as noted in our guidance, better mix of product on higher margin product as we move forward throughout ‘24, and our long-term continued leverage of our NPI. Anything that we can also get from our vertical integration where it drives margin improvement, we'll be implementing that as well.\nMark Miller: Last question is the data centers. A couple of firms like Cigar and Western Digital are finally saying they're seeing light at the end of the tunnel with their data center customers. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of data center business?\nChuck Mattera: Sanjay, do you want to just make [Multiple Speakers] talk about it?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Yes, sure. So within our data comm business, there are two drivers. The biggest one today is AI, which is growing at a 47% CAGR. Our traditional non-AI business, if you will, is growing at a slower clip. But together it still -- the market is still continuing to grow at a 20% CAGR long-term. So we are pretty excited about that market.\nMark Miller: Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, yes, good morning guys. Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Really appreciate it. Chuck, I guess just sticking on transceivers and the higher speed. Do you have any sense if your position, I guess, how your position from a share perspective going forward? Would you expect to, I guess any view on expectations to maintain share going forward, gain share going forward, any context there would be helpful. And I have a quick follow-up, thanks.\nChuck Mattera: I believe that we're in a great position. I believe that if you look even beyond 800G, given the portfolio that we have, the products coming through the funnel, that we're going to be able to continue to not only maintain that position, but we're counting on growing it.\nAnanda Baruah: And are you guys seeing, just given all the activity in AI, are you seeing any greater urgency from your engagements around 1.6T? You know, you've given a lot of great context, actually, this calendar year, with regards to sort of timelines, industry 1.6T adoption. You made reference, I think, in the slide deck today to 3.2T. Any greater urgency there given what's going on in AI and any context around your, kind of, market positioning with regards to that. And that's it for me, thanks.\nChuck Mattera: Okay. Thanks, Ananda. Sanjay?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Yes, sure. Thanks, Ananda, for the question. So one thing is very clear. With AI, we need to go higher and higher speeds, and it needs to happen, you know, earlier. We're making great progress towards our 1.6T. We believe that we'll be one of the first ones out there. And in terms of timing, we're looking at -- we think the market will be trying to inflect in 1.60T around fiscal ‘25. And I just want to say we've got all the key enabling blocks, especially the DFB-Mach-Zehnder laser, which is a 200G laser that we demonstrated at ECOC. So we're making good progress there. Hopefully, that helps.\nAnanda Baruah: That's great. Appreciate it, guys. Yes, no, that's super helpful. Appreciate it.\nChuck Mattera: Thanks, Ananda.\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you.\nOperator: 1 moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning Dave.\nDave Kang: Good morning. Yes, good morning. Thank you. Just regarding your data comics, I was wondering if you can provide by what the mix was between 100 gig, 400 gig, 800 gig?\nChuck Mattera: Yes. Please, Sanjai.\nSanjai Parthasarathi: So the high speed which we define as 200G and above was 70% of their avenues last quarter.\nDave Kang: So I assume the remaining 30% is 100 gig [Indiscernible]. How should we think about, I mean, first of all, are they growing? And what do you think their runway is, and how should we think about pending decay eventually?\nSanjai Parthasarathi: Yes, I mean, the slower speeds are typically today non-AI related, so they're not growing as fast as 800G and even some parts of 400G. But long-term, we still believe those speeds are still going to continue to grow. Especially the AI kind of moves towards the edge of the networks.\nDave Kang: Got it. And my follow-up is regarding your CapEx. How should we think about CapEx for this fiscal year? And then fiscal ‘25 after you get that $1 billion investment from two Japanese companies? How will that drop off in ‘25 after silicon carbide investments?\nChuck Mattera: Okay, two great questions, Dave. Rich, will you take those?\nRich Martucci: Yes. So as of right now, we're still holding to the full-year guidance that we previously gave of $350 million to $400 million for FY ‘24. On the silicon carbide for FY ‘25, obviously the investment will offset or what we thought we were going to invest in ‘25.\nChuck Mattera: Dave, when we close, we will run through in that next quarter revisions to our guidance. And in the reporting quarter after the close, we'll update and give a strong sense for what we see both for ‘24 and give at least a glimpse of ‘25. Okay?\nDave Kang: Got it. Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Yes. Thank you, Dave.\nPaul Silverstein: Kevin, can we go on to the next speaker?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning, Tim.\nOperator: Tim, your line is on mute.\nChuck Mattera: Good morning, Tim.\nTim Savageaux: Sorry about that. Good morning, a couple of math questions here. I think with some significant implications maybe. First one is on results and guide telecom versus datacom. And I think the anecdotal commentary is about inventory digestion on the cloud side, but if you look at how that's proceeding, it seems like most of the weakness sequentially was in telecom, going from 40% to 29% on a declining number. So, we talk in order book versus revenues and we're talking about those comments. Am I looking at that right? As you look at the guide, is most of that sequential growth, about $75 million bucks, is that in comms and is that some AI starting to shift or telecom bouncing back or how will we characterize that? And I have a follow up.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, well I think there's really two questions. Beck will take the one that's market related and Rich will take the finance.\nBeck Mason: Sure, I mean on the telecom side, we see that growing, you know, modestly this quarter and then we see double-digit growth recovery in the second-half of this fiscal year for our telecom revenues, right? And I can comment on the ratio that was relative to the revenue last quarter.\nChuck Mattera: Exactly. Okay. Tim, would you repeat the second part of your question for Rich?\nTim Savageaux: Let me go on to the third part. And of course, there's a Rich history of multi-part questions here with numbers of this call. But and that is the overall question I'm saying I'm going to ask is what is the absolute size of your AI backlog, but I'm going to try and get there in a couple of parts which is you talked about an order increase last quarter that was entirely networking driven, 30%. That seems like it's $300 million. There's some commentary here in the call about, despite orders coming down, the AI backlog going up 200%. So I'm going to give you a chance here just to give us a number for what you got in backlog that you would consider AI, whether that's all 800 gig or not?\nChuck Mattera: Yes, I don't think we can give you that. What I can tell you is it's a substantial and meaningfully material one-off. But I'm not going to give you the number.\nTim Savageaux: Okay, thanks.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, thank you, Tim.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, Thanks. Good morning. So you seem to be suggesting some recovery in the second-half on both the OLED side and the WFE side of the business? The OLED side, I think we understand what's happening with service utilization going up. What's your line of sight in terms of deployment of new Excimer laser tools in the second-half of fiscal ‘24, as well as your line of sight on the WFE improvement in the second-half?\nChuck Mattera: Yes, as you mentioned, service utilization, uptick in the Excimer business for display in the near-term. In the long-term, the principal movements in the display market will be around the adoption of OLED technology in laptops, in tablets, in IT panels. And we are engaging with customers on Gen 8 investments. The timing of those Gen 8 investments should be clear early calendar year ‘25 and we'll be well positioned to work with our customers on the expansion of OLED capacity for tablets and for laptops, which would be incremental to our current business. We've developed solid state technology in line with the challenges of maintaining a sensible cost level for those larger OLED panels. And in the long-term, we see migration with TVs into the micro LED markets, which we're investing heavily in developing new tools for. Jim, did you have a second one?\nJim Ricchiuti: Yes, the other question was just, and maybe I'll just group this into one last question on the balance of that laser and industrial business. It sounds like you're feeling relatively positive about the WFE portion of the business. Back-end semi, is that going to continue to be relatively weak? And are you assuming looking at precision manufacturing beyond the current quarter that the recovery there is still fairly uncertain? Is that a good way to characterize the outlook for this part of the business?\nChris Dorman: Yes, front end semi remains strong. The reasons for that are that, you know, the customer relationship in the front end semi market is a long-term roadmap. We engage, we partner with our customers in terms of developing that long-term roadmap. We develop lasers specifically for our partners in that area. And it's more than a sale. The relationship lasts for 20-years in terms of one particular laser technology. The service component of the semi-cap business is very significant. And so we go on this long-term journey which gives us more certainty in the service business of the emergence of the semi-cap inspection market. So we get a great deal of visibility through our customers on that. In terms of back end, it is softer. The recovery is taking longer, potentially the end of the fiscal year to see any change there. And in precision manufacturing, PMI, as Magnus mentioned before, the recovery is around the end of the year. But all of that, the precision manufacturing, the back end semi is offset by the strength in display and the strength in semiconductor coupled equipment way for inspection.\nChuck Mattera: Thank you, Chris.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, Jim, thanks for your question.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you, yes.\nChuck Mattera: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further requests at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nChuck Mattera: Kevin, thank you. And I want to thank all the analysts on the call for your thoughtful questions. As always, if we could be of any help throughout the quarter, please feel free to reach out. And I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."
