[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rachel White, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRachel White: Good afternoon, and welcome to Paycor earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, which ended on December 31. On the call with me today are Raul Villar, Jr., Paycor’s Chief Executive Officer; and Adam Ante, Paycor’s Chief Financial Officer. Our financial results can be found in our press release issued today, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today’s call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our website following the conclusion of the call. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our financial results, products, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are based on management’s current expectations as of today and may not be updated in the future. Therefore, these statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We also will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and key business metrics to provide additional information to investors. Definitions of non-GAAP measures and key business metrics and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are provided in our press release on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Raul.\nRaul Villar : Thank you, Rachel, and thank you all for joining us to discuss Paycor’s fiscal second quarter results. We had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 20% year-over-year. Margins expanded 130 basis points over the prior year, while we continue to invest in sales expansion and in our innovative HCM suite. HCM demand is healthy. Our deal pipeline is up significantly year-over-year, and our win rates remain strong. We continue to excel up market, especially among the higher end of SMB and enterprise customers with thousands of employees, who tend to purchase a more holistic solution and are driving higher attach rates and higher average deal sizes. Our results demonstrate our consistent execution against our two primary growth drivers, increasing the number of employees on our platform and expanding the amount we charge per employee per month for PEPM. First, we are expanding employees on the platform through a combination of direct and indirect sales efforts. We remain on-track to grow our direct sales force approximately 20% this fiscal year to strategically increase our sales coverage in the largest U.S. metropolitan areas. As we expand our sales coverage, we are also increasing our broker coverage. We increased the number of active referring brokers by over 25% from the prior year and 50% of our field bookings in the quarter were broker influenced. We are also experiencing great traction with our embedded HCM solution, the indirect go-to-market channel we announced in August. Leveraging our industry-leading interoperability engine, we enable software partners to embed our HCM solution within their platform for a seamless client experience. In Q2, we had robust new sales among existing partners and expanded our pipeline of interested partners. Second, we continue to enhance our award-winning HCM suite with new capabilities that increase the value to our customers and our future PEPM opportunity. In the second quarter our list PEPM was $51, which equates to 16% growth year-over-year. This month we introduced two powerful data-driven analytical tools that empower frontline leaders to unlock the potential of their people and business performance. Pay benchmarking enables leaders to optimize compensation strategies and pay decisions based on industry standards and market data. We also launched labor forecasting within workforce management to help customers plan optimal staffing schedules for their businesses based on key demand drivers such as revenue, sales volume or customer foot traffic. These innovative modules will contribute to future PEPM expansion. Paycor recently received 5 Brandon Hall Technology Awards, which honor HR technology trailblazers. While we were acknowledged across our HCM suite, the core leadership framework that we launched a year ago won gold for the best advance in online coaching tools. The framework enables customers to evaluate the efficacy of their leaders, reinforce leadership best practices and to trigger development paths based on areas of growth identified. These tools are already making an impact in helping educate customers on how to transform their managers into effective leaders. Since joining Paycorp in 2018, Ryan Bergstrom has been vital in driving the company's growth and shaping our HCM suite into the market leader it is today. Under his leadership, list PEPM increased more than 75% since fiscal 2019, and I am thrilled we will now oversee our product and technology groups. Combining these functions will enable greater synergies and strengthen our capabilities to seamlessly power people and performance for our clients. I would also like to acknowledge our product and engineering teams for their unwavering dedication to building our award-winning platform and enabling its rapid expansion. We continue to strategically incorporate AI to add value to customers within our HCM suite, elevate our customer experience and improve our efficiency. And our customer experience organization, we deployed AI agent assist technology, which empowers advocates to resolve customer inquiries faster and ensure consistent, high-quality experiences as we scale. I would like to thank all Paycorp associates, especially our implementation, service and success teams for their contributions during our busiest time of year. Year-over-year, we improved execution, truly making it the most efficient and best year-end experience for our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam to discuss our financial results and guidance.\nAdam Ante : Thanks, Raul. I'll discuss our second quarter results then share our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year. Paycor delivered another strong quarter with total revenues of $160 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Recurring revenue grew 18% year-over-year, an acceleration of 2 percentage points sequentially driven by continued success of market and strong year in form filings. As Raul mentioned, our growth is fueled by expanding the number of employees on our platform and the amount we charge per employee per month. Employees grew 10% over the prior year primarily from new logos and to a lesser extent, organic labor market growth, which has continued to slow. We now have approximately 2.6 million employees across more than 30,000 customers. As we continue to expand our product capabilities and move up market, we are experiencing outsized growth among customers with 100 to multiple thousands of employees. In the quarter, we grew customers with more than 1,000 employees by 18%, highlighting the success of our product and service investments. We gained momentum with our embedded HCM solution, which contributed 2 points of employee growth this quarter, up 1 point sequentially. The average size of customers within our embedded channel is more than double our average customer size today. While we're encouraged by the early momentum, these larger embedded deals will begin to contribute more meaningfully to our revenue growth in fiscal '25 and be accretive to margins as the partnerships ramp over time. Effective PEPM increased 7% year-over-year to more than $19 for the quarter. Excluding embedded HCM deals, effective PEPM increased 9%, driven by expansion of our product suite, effective PEPM growth has been powered by a combination of cross-sales, pricing initiatives and higher bundle adoption. We expect more moderate PEPM growth contributions moving forward as we onboard larger enterprise customers and embedded HCM partners with volume discounts, which will be offset by their higher average deal sizes and stronger margins. In addition to driving steady top line growth, we've consistently expanded margins as we scale the business. Adjusted gross profit margin, excluding depreciation and amortization improved to 79%, a 110 basis points higher than the prior year, while elevating our client experience. Sales and marketing expense was $50 million or 31% of revenue, similar to levels a year ago to achieve our sales force expansion targets. Comparable to prior years, we invested 16% of revenue or $25 million in R&D on a gross basis to differentiate our HCM suite with valuable capabilities for our customers. We are gaining economies of scale in G&A as we grow. G&A expense was $22 million or 13.5% of revenue, an improvement of 100 basis points from last year. Adjusted operating income increased more than 30% to $23 million with margins of 14.6%, up 130 basis points from last year, while we continue to make strategic investments to expand our sales force and deliver product innovation. We generated $15 million of adjusted free cash flow or 9% mark in this quarter. We ended the quarter with $62 million of cash and no debt. As we look ahead, demand continues to be healthy for modern HCM solutions. The labor market remains tight and our guidance assumes flat organic employee growth among existing customers for the rest of the fiscal year. The combination of steady labor market growth and our backlog of enterprise and embedded HCM deals provides confidence in our second half. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues of between $185 million and $187 million or 16% growth at the high end of the range and adjusted operating income of between $45 million and $46 million. For the full year, we expect revenues of $650 million to $656 million or 19% growth at the top end of the range, and we anticipate adjusted operating income of $104 million to $108 million. This quarter, we generated $12 million of interest income on average client funds of approximately $1.1 billion, an effective rate of just under 450 basis points. Based on current rates, we expect interest income in the range of $45 million to $46 million for the full year. We remain optimistic about our opportunity in HCM. There's plenty of runway for sustainable growth as the vast majority of U.S. employees are still being paid by legacy systems. It's an essential capability for any business, and we're delivering compelling ROI for clients to switch. Adding to our opportunity is the continual expansion of our HCM suite, which has increased over 75% since fiscal 2019. We are demonstrating margin expansion as we scale the business and believe there is significant opportunity to drive further leverage. We believe we are well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth and improve profitability over the long-term. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy : Congrats on a nice consistent performance. I wanted to try to double-click on the embedded HCM solution. You mentioned it once or twice, I recall the announcement last summer, I think you've been refining the product in the go-to-market. Do you have any line of sight into maybe some larger partners that might take it live and start generating bookings for you maybe later this year or as you get into the early part of next year?\nAdam Ante : Yes. Mark, Absolutely. I mean, we have a pretty strong pipeline right now for new deals as well as with the existing partners, just the number of deals that they're booking has been really strong and beat our expectations early. Of course, it's still relatively small, but relative to the rest of the business. But we've seen some really success. We're really excited about how the pipeline is building on both the existing clients and future partnerships already.\nRaul Villar : Yes. Mark, what I would -- what I would add is that the signing the partnerships is lumpy, right? It just takes a lot of time to get those through. And so, we've built up a really nice pipeline that we're hoping that will start to go from pipeline to deals closed over the next 60 days.\nMark Murphy : I see. Okay. And just to double check on this we think that it's going to be kind of margin neutral or slightly margin accretive? Once that gets going at the gross margin level?\nAdam Ante : Yes. I mean, we are really excited about the margin opportunity here. Between the gross margin and the adjusted operating income, I mean, I think you're going to see a little bit more favorability on overall adjusted operating income. Over just the gross margin side of the house, but that's primarily driven by the really low sales and marketing costs. I mean it's like multiples lower in terms of the sales cost to bring the clients on. And depending on the size of the client, if they're bringing the portfolio on, you still might see some more implementation costs associated with that. And that's what we've actually experienced thus far. So when we talk about margin expansion really into '25, it's because there's a little bit more upfront costs associated with bringing those portfolios over, but the ongoing sales cost is significantly lower for the new business.\nMark Murphy : Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And one final one. I noticed you mentioned that you're strategically incorporating AI into the business, which is great to hear. Are you seeing efficiencies from those products or initiatives that are significant enough to allow you to cover more ground or write more code per developer, provide more support per person or that type of thing? I'm just wondering, if the -- I'm wondering if you are sensing any kind of noticeable uplift that might either be helping to drive some of the margin expansion or alter hiring plans or even just kind of change your growth algorithm in the next several years.\nRaul Villar : Yes. I think it's -- we're still in the very early innings, and I think we're leveraging the technology in all those areas. And I think as we move forward, we'll start to model that into our future guidance from that perspective. But ultimately, it's helping us -- our #1 priority, is to deliver a better user experience. The #2 priority is to become more efficient. And we think both are in line of sight, but we want to make sure the user experience is great. And then ultimately, we think as we continue to grow, we'll be able to do it more efficiently.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges : I want to stay on this topic of growth algorithm and specifically, the delta between how you're thinking about hiring, I think you mentioned that 20% benchmark pretty consistently versus the 18% recurring revenue growth this quarter and where that can go longer term. Maybe you could comment a little bit on how you're seeing tenured sales reps ramp within the sales force? How you're thinking about improving churn? And any other data plans that we should have as we think about your overall sales force productivity over the next couple of years?\nRaul Villar : Yes. Gabriel, it's Raul. We just see such a big opportunity in the marketplace in Tier 1 and also in Tier 2 and Tier 3 that we believe 20% is an optimal number for us to hire. And as we've talked about previously, reps, their productivity increases with their tenure. And so, we're excited that we're seeing our average tenure grow year-over-year. And we believe that's what we're focused on is to continue to grow our average tenure, which will drive more productivity, which will drive long-term sales and marketing efficiency.\nGabriela Borges : Great. That makes sense. And then as a follow-up, I know in the past Raul, you made some interesting observations on hiring and labor trends within the SMB ecosystem versus maybe slightly above in the mid-market and enterprise. I know you mentioned broadly the commentary of the demand environment is healthy. Would love to share a little bit more within that? Any vertical specific color and any comparing contrast between the lower end of the market and the mid-market.\nRaul Villar : Yes. I think we've seen demand in all three of our segments. The low end of SMB, the mid-market and the enterprise market, we've seen really strong top of the funnel demand. So that's exciting. Nothing has changed there. I think when you break it down from an industry perspective, we've seen some unique trends in new bookings like we're seeing real strength in food and beverage and professional services. We've seen, what I would say, year-over-year modest performance in manufacturing. So from that perspective, it kind of mirrors some of what you would read in the newspapers. But overall, demand has been strong across all three segments that we serve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank.\nBhavin Shah: Starting with that I’m just looking at kind of guidance for the back half of the year. Can you maybe just dive into the assumptions that are embedded in terms of the numbers? It seems like there's a little bit of a deceleration in 3Q that might be just a tougher comp with forms. But more broadly, as we think about embedded payroll kind of continue to take off, looking at how you performed in the quarter relative to the raise in the guide. It seems like there's a little bit more conservative here. Can you just provide more insight?\nAdam Ante: Yes, we try to keep a consistent level of conservatism and so not really changing any philosophy here. We do see that and expect that in Q3. The forms filing generally is going to drive a slightly lower growth rate, right, because form filings are going to grow more at the rate of employee growth, plus or minus sort of any pricing changes that may be happening and we're seeing less related to ERC. Of course, so that dynamic is going to slow down slightly in Q3. And then we also just had a little bit of overperformance of form filings that came into Q2, which is part of the guide as you look at the total beat from Q2 into the full year, a portion of that is related to the form filings. And so we just -- we aren't going to see upside to the full year for that which we think makes sense just given some of the performance. So, just a slightly slower growth rate in Q3 with the form filings, which are outsized in Q3.\nBhavin Shah: Super helpful here. Just one quick follow-up. It's great to hear the additional broker traction. Can you just dive into a little bit of your efforts here? And what's driving the increased kind of adoption within the active brokers that are kind of referring clients to yourselves?\nRaul Villar : Yes. I think, we've just really focused our direct sales team on the best targets. And so we have 4 national partnerships that we're really focusing on to drive opportunities. As we expand our sales headcount, obviously, it gives us an opportunity to expand how many people are reaching into the broker network. And so I think the value proposition works. They love the platform, and it's just about us continuing to focus on the benefit brokers that have the most clients in our target market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terrell Tillman with Truist Securities.\nTerrell Tillman : Solid execution here in the quarter. I did have a question and a follow-up. I would say the first question almost might be a 2-parter, but hopefully, it counts as just one question. Raul, in terms of like do you need a little bit of an evolving or different go-to-market and kind of product requirements for 1,000-plus employee deals? And then the second part of that first question is, I mean, if we're looking at 3Q and even early part of 4Q in terms of signing business. I mean, will you actually not maybe even see that much recurring revenue this year for those kinds of bigger transactions? And then I had a follow-up for Adam.\nRaul Villar : Yes. On the enterprise side, the product -- the clients are pulling us into the enterprise. So the platform hunts in the enterprise space, lots of feature functionality on the talent side, which is really attractive to those customers. And so that's what's taking us there. We also have reps, our most experienced reps are really focused on the enterprise accounts. So, we've slightly segmented the sales force from that perspective to make sure that we have the right skill level that are calling on those accounts.\nTerrell Tillman : And I guess maybe just a follow-up, Adam. It kind of relates to the prior question, looking at the full year guide and then the over performance in 2Q. Has anything notably changed for the full year form filing assumptions or any kind of delta in terms of your internal recurring revenue assumption?\nAdam Ante : No, nothing's changed. I mean, we see it's really there's a bit of operational performance that goes into getting the W-2s prepped and shipped. And we just -- we had some overperformance there towards the end of December, where we were able to be a little bit more effective at getting those out the door. And that helped the overperformance here in Q2. So nothing on the full year that we would expect to be any different. And in fact, that's why we see the continued -- feel good about the continued guide and raise for the full year on both the recurring and overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham & Company.\nScott Berg : Really nice results this quarter. Congrats. A couple of questions for me. Let's start on the broker channel. I think you said 50% of your bookings in the quarter were a contribution from the broker channel there. How should we think about those contributions going forward? Because 50 seems like a very high number. Do you expect that pace to continue? Or does it moderate from there?\nRaul Villar : I think we've continued to think it would slightly moderate, Scott, but it's remained really strong. I think as we think about our 3-year outlook, we think high 30s, mid-40s is probably where we'll be as we continue to scale bookings. But that being said, we're still in the early innings, where there's tons of white space in the broker opportunity. So we're kind of just getting started. And our execution has gotten significantly better this year. And so the team that we have driving these programs for us has done a phenomenal job, and we're really proud of the results.\nScott Berg : Got it. Helpful. And then from a follow-up perspective, staying on the sales kind of route. Can you give some commentary on progress around back to the base selling, selling to your existing installed base? You mentioned your PEPM is up 75% over the last several years, gives you certainly a lot more to sell. But any changes with the way that existing customers or maybe what their appetites look like for buying additional modules?\nRaul Villar : No. We -- I mean, it's been consistent. We're continuing to suddenly improve modules sold. Obviously, talent has a significant attach rate workforce management, also significant attach rate. And so we feel good, both at point of sale that we're delivering a bigger bundle but also our cross-selling team continues to really hit the ball out of the park. And so continuing to work with our clients to make sure they're optimizing the latest technology that we offer. So, it's been really successful and we still have a lot of opportunity in that channel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Well, obviously, in fiscal '23, you increased or we'll say, entering fiscal 2040, your sales headcount was up about 22%. And you're going to grow high teens this year all up, so there's about a 5-point delta. How should we think about those converging on a go-forward basis? What needs to happen to get those two to me?\nRaul Villar : Yes. It's really about us continuing to grow the tenure in our sales organization. And as we continue to focus on driving that tenure, which is really growing the person months’ work, which has grown year-over-year and it's moving in the right direction. That tender drives productivity. So as we anniversary these large, what we would call headcount classes, year-over-year, we're going to see improved productivity. And so, it's really about us driving them from year 1 to year 2 to year 3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson : So just one for me on the embedded channel. So I'd love to understand as you think about the 2% [indiscernible] platform already. Is that fairly concentrated within a couple of customers? Or is it maybe a little bit more diverse and then there's kind of an opportunity to expand with some of those partners over time?\nAdam Ante : Yes. Brian, yes, I mean it's just with a couple of partners right now. It's still really early with us in terms of the number of active partners that we have on our platform. And so yes, there's only a few partners that are really generating that sort of growth for us. And of course, as we continue to sign new partners, we're going to see a lot more expansion. There's not really a concentration from an end customer perspective. They do look a lot like the customers that we have today, they're strong middle market and enterprise customers. But the partners themselves are there's still just a few.\nBrian Peterson : And Adam, maybe a follow-up. So how do we think about the land and expand in that channel. So when you kind of get launched with one of those customers did it get fully implemented across the customer base? Or is that something that gradually folds in over time?\nRaul Villar : Yes. Every agreement is unique. The ones that we have today were -- had existing customer bases that they're converting over. And then they sell on a go-forward basis to new and so we've been really pleased with the cross-selling ability of our partners to sell new on a go-forward basis outside of the existing base. And so that's kind of exceeded our expectations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jared Levine with TD Cowen.\nZack Ajzenman : This is Zack Ajzenman on for Jared. First question on demand. Any change in the pace of prospective client decision-making relative to prior quarters? And further, any change in attach rates on new client sales? If so, what modules and functionality or what you think a change in attach rate?\nRaul Villar : Yes. As far as deal cycle time frame, on the entire base, there's no change. However, if you break it down by size, I mean there's a subtle elongation in the enterprise space year-over-year, but we're on a smaller sample size. So -- but ultimately, our core overall base the same, no changes in the mid-market or SMB space. And as far as modules go, we continue to slightly tick up. So they're not ticking down. They're actually -- we're seeing slightly better attachment across the board.\nZack Ajzenman: Got it. And a follow-up on retention. How do the Januarys gross revenue retention compare year-on-year? And if it was consistent, where there any underlying changes based on employer size segment or based on controllable versus uncontrollable churn?\nAdam Ante : Yes. I mean, we haven't shared like month -- specific month retention results, but gross retention has been consistent in January, of course, is a big month for us, both on the starts and losses. And I'd say that it's been in line with our expectations broadly, especially is how we're thinking about guidance for the full year as well. So no significant changes one way or the other on retention broadly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair.\nMatt Pfau : Just wanted to ask one on embedded HCM. It would be helpful if you could just help us understand the cadence of when a partners signed, how long it takes for them to build pipeline and then how long it takes for them to convert that pipeline. So the partners that are currently converting when did they originally start using the embedded HCM functionality? And then how long before we start to see a material contribution to growth from the partners that are in the pipeline and the ones that you currently signed?\nRaul Villar : Yes. Every deal is slightly different. In the sense that some have existing client bases that need to be converted. And so that may take a little longer upfront work on the implementation side. And then others are looking to sell new and that's a quicker go-to-market motion. So it really depends on the type of partner. And so, I think from our perspective, we're looking to continue to expand the partner base and then continue to expand the penetration of existing partners and new partners, once they're up and running, they have contributions on a monthly basis. So it's -- the speed to success is relatively short. It's no different than the sales cycle of a normal mid-market rep in the industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet: I guess one more on the embedded channel. Just curious, I know it's early, but what kind of attach rate of multiple products are you seeing? Is it drastically different than sort of the overall average? And then maybe how do you see that trending? Is there something that is maybe more specifically needed in that embedded channel that maybe is less common or more common? So, I'm just curious on how the number of products per customer?\nRaul Villar : Yes. When we entered it was really, Matt, was primarily payroll and which is what we were focused on. And what we found is that people also want workforce management and some of the other services. So it's actually a broader suite than we anticipated, when we started the venture. So payroll definitely is the driver of the conversation, but many are focused on workforce management, reporting, analytics, a lot of the other ancillary services that our clients talent, that our clients are purchasing they're wanting as well. Because the end client doesn't really -- isn't any different than the end client we sell. It's just a different way to go after the end client.\nMatt VanVliet: Okay. Very helpful. And then when you're looking at the roughly 20% headcount growth that you're looking for on the go-to-market team, any particular focus around whether it's the top 50 markets that you're targeting? Is it a little more top heavy -- are you trying to kind of reach out and further the breadth there? Just curious where you have a need for more capacity across those key markets?\nRaul Villar : Yes. I mean we can add sales reps in almost every market in the U.S. still. There's so much opportunity available. The way we think about it and the way we've allocated our resources over the past few years is that about 70% to 75% of the hires go into a Tier 1 market, which we define as the 15 largest cities in America. And then the balance go into Tier 2 and Tier 3, which are the next 35 largest cities in America. And that combination is kind of the formula that we're executing against today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Enders with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is George on for Steve. I think, first, there's been some noise with some of your peers in the payroll space. I'm just wondering, if that's caused any incremental shifts in the competitive landscape and where you're sourcing bookings from?\nRaul Villar : I didn't know there was any noise going on in the category. But that -- we compete against everyone in the category. And we take share from everyone in the category. And we'll continue to do that. In a quarter, you don't really see any material changes that bounce around. Most of these decisions take a quarter or 2 to happen. And so we'll see as we go forward if that changes. At the end of the day, what we're really focused on is our value propositions on delivering a perfect payroll every time. That's not that complicated and really delivering tools for leaders so they can power their people and performance. And that's what we go-to-market with. We have a modern tech stack. We deliver the most PEPM in the category. And so, we're going after all competitors. We're not focused on any one.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That makes sense. And then just a follow-up on embedded. I think you've talked about how each of these deals tend to be somewhat bespoke and there's a bit of an onboarding process, but I'm just wondering if you can talk about the learnings you've had from the partners that are ramping so far, if there's any kind of commonalities that you can leverage to kind of smooth the onboarding process for future partners and kind of speed up the flywheel of the product?\nRaul Villar : Yes, for sure. I mean I think we're starting to understand the framework while every partner is different, they do get bucketed into what type of partners. And a lot of that is what type of partners. Is it a workforce management solution? Is it a vertical software solution? Is it an ERP? Those kind of things, they all have slightly different needs and we're building playbooks by partner type to help make the implementation more efficient and to make the cross-selling more effective over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets.\nKyle Aberasturi : This is Kyle Aberasturi on for Dan Jester. On the two new launches, benchmarking and forecasting, I was wondering if you could provide any further color here. Are these two new modules? Are you charging for them? And then how you're thinking about the growth opportunity relative to other modules? And then my second question, just if you could dig a bit deeper into the booking conditions you saw during the quarter, maybe a shift as 4Q progress.\nRaul Villar : Yes. So the two new products will each add incremental PEPM. I believe it's a $1 PEPM for each of the new products. And they're really a combination of taking our data analytics capabilities and providing insights for frontline leaders so they can be more effective with compensation strategies and scheduling strategies with their employees. And so it fits right in line with our strategy and where we're trying to help our customers. Our second quarter or calendar fourth quarter bookings were consistent across all of our segments and we didn't have anything that jumped off the page from that perspective. And so it's kind of what we expected.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon : Wondering with regards to the enterprise accounts, you talked about them a little bit more. And I'm wondering how far upmarket could you be pulled? And to what extent are you managing the sales force in terms of making sure that they stay within the target market? Or how are you thinking about that?\nRaul Villar : Yes. I mean, as you know, as a savvy long-time HCM analyst, while we define ourselves by size, like clients don't define themselves out with their needs to find what kind of platform they can use. So it's really a needs analysis that we look at. And we sell into the thousands. We have clients with over 10,000 employees and so it really depends on what the client -- what needs the client is looking for and we presented it that way. Obviously, our most tenured reps are the ones that are focused on the enterprise accounts. So they understand the power, the Paycorp platform, and they help the customers make sure that we can meet all their needs. So, it's obviously we're in the early innings here. But over the last 4 or 5 quarters, we continue to get pulled up market based on the power of the platform. And we've continued to educate our reps and segment our reps to be able to meet the opportunity.\nMark Marcon : That's great. And you mentioned the tenure of the sales force. Can you talk a little bit more about the sales force just in terms of your increasing effectiveness with regards to selecting training and keeping them?\nRaul Villar : Yes. I mean so that's the #1 priority. And what I would say is we've increased our person months' worth by over 15% year-over-year. And so that's really positive for us. And we're really focused on onboarding and activating the reps and making them successful. And so that's an ongoing process. We could clearly do better there. We want to do better. And -- but I think we're making good progress. And if we continue to see this kind of progress, it will continue to drive productivity year-over-year.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Raul Villar for closing comments.\nRaul Villar: Thank you again for joining us this evening. Demand remains healthy with plenty of runway for sustainable growth, and we remain focused on executing our strategy to capture market share. We look forward to connecting with you at several upcoming events, including the JMP Securities Technology Conference in San Francisco. Have a great night, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rachel White, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRachel White: Good afternoon and welcome to Paycor’s earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, which ended on September 30. On the call with me today are Raul Villar, Jr., Paycor’s Chief Executive Officer; and Adam Ante, Paycor’s Chief Financial Officer. Our financial results can be found in our press release issued today, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today’s call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website following the conclusion of the call. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our financial results, products, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are based on management’s current expectations as of today and may not be updated in the future. Therefore, these statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We also will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and key business metrics to provide additional information to investors. Definitions of non-GAAP measures and key business metrics and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are provided in our press release on our website. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Raul.\nRaul Villar: Thank you, Rachel and thank you all for joining us to discuss Paycor’s fiscal first quarter results. We had a strong start to the year with revenue growth of 21% this quarter. We drove margin expansion of nearly 200 basis points year-over-year while continuing to invest in differentiating our platform, which increases the value of our HCM suite to our customers and expand our future PEPM opportunity. The demand environment remains solid for our innovative HCM suite that empowers leaders to unlock the potential of their people and business performance. As we shift upmarket, clients tend to purchase a more complete solution and average deal size and attach rates continues to expand nicely. Our deal pipeline is up year-over-year and win rates remain strong. Our team is making significant progress on our two strategic growth initiatives: expanding sales coverage and increasing the amount we charge per employee per month or PEPM. We are on track to deliver on our full year sales headcount growth target of approximately 20% and sales productivity is progressing in line with our expectations. This quarter, we announced a new go-to-market channel, leveraging our industry-leading interoperability engine. Paycor has a substantial opportunity to partner with technology firms such as vertical-focused SaaS solutions. Our existing software partners offer our embedded HCM solutions nested within their platform for a seamless client experience. Legacy in-house solutions are right for disruption as the HCM requirements continue to increase in complexity and demand for more than just the payroll solution. We are the only HCM provider with an embedded mid-market offering, and we have a growing pipeline of interested partners. The larger embedded HCM partnerships we mentioned last call will increasingly contribute to our revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 and be accretive to margins in fiscal ‘25. This quarter we enhanced our modern award-winning HCM suite with valuable new functionality that powers people and performance. Our list PEPM of $51 increased $9 or 21% year-on-year, which equates to a PEPM of $612. Further strengthening our suite of artificial intelligence solutions, we recently released a new generative AI analytics, digital assistance powered by Visier. The new offering empowers leaders to quickly and easily consume people-focused analytics and a conversational chat interface. We are helping leaders save time and resources by seamlessly providing them with the answers they need to effectively power their teams. We continue to see excellent adoption of the talent solution we launched in fiscal 2021, with revenues up 40% year-over-year. We are also proud that nucleus research recently recognized our talent acquisition suite as a market leader. I am also incredibly pleased with the promotion of Brett Meager, to Chief Customer Experience Officer, where she will lead our next generation of service, leveraging data and technology to best serve our customers. In this new role, Brett will unify Paycor’s implementation and service and loyalty organization further enhancing the company’s relentless focus on creating an irresistible customer experience. Lastly, I am proud Paycor received several culture excellence awards by Top Workplaces. This is the third consecutive year we have been recognized for promoting DE&I practices. And the first time we were acknowledged for employee appreciation, employee well-being and professional development. As a human capital management company, we know firsthand how important leaders and culture are in driving employee engagement and business performance. With that, I will turn the call over to Adam to discuss our financial results and guidance.\nAdam Ante: Thanks, Raul. I’ll discuss our first quarter results and share our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. This quarter, Paycor generated total revenues of $144 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Recurring revenue grew 16% year-over-year, slightly above our guidance as labor market growth of 2% marginally outperformed our 0 to 1% assumption. Recurring revenue growth is largely driven by increasing the number of employees on our platform and the amount we charge per employee per month. We have more than 2.5 million employees on our platform, up 9% over the prior year across more than 30,800 customers. As we shift our portfolio upmarket, our average customer size continues to increase and now stands at 83 employees per customer, up from 78 a year ago, supported by even stronger growth in enterprise customers. In line with this shift, the number of employees in the mid-market and enterprise grew 11% year-over-year, while growth in the micro segment remained flat. Additionally, about 1 point of our employee growth this quarter is from our embedded HCM solutions. In conjunction with our transition years ago to being a modern cloud HCM platform, we price our solutions on a PEPM model. This pricing model has enabled us to simplify our pricing, employing a bundled offering approach and reduce friction in the adoption of our broader set of HCM solutions. We believe our cloud platform and pricing model provides much better value and predictability for our customers and for Paycor. As our HCM suite has expanded, more than half of our revenue is generated from non-payroll HCM solutions, such as talent and workforce management. All of which is on a PEPM pricing model. Effective PEPM increased 6% year-over-year to more than $17 for the quarter, driven by continued expansion of our product suite, PEPM growth has been fueled by a combination of cross-sales, pricing initiatives and higher bundle adoption. We are seeing steady PEPM contribution from cross-sales and higher bundle adoption. However, we expect more moderate contributions from pricing initiatives as inflation flows and new business as we onboard larger enterprise and embedded HCM technology partners with greater pricing power, which will be offset by higher average deal sizes and stronger margins. While our primary objective remains sustainable 20% plus recurring revenue growth, we’ve consistently expanded margins as we scale the business. Adjusted gross profit margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, improved to 78.3%, more than 140 basis points higher than the prior year while continuing to invest in differentiating our client experience. Sales and marketing expense was $47 million or 33% of revenue, similar to levels a year ago as we increased sales coverage nationwide to capital market share. On a gross basis, we invested $25 million in R&D or 17% of revenue to enhance our HCM platform and expand our PEPM opportunity. On an annual basis, we expect to invest 15% to 16% of revenue, similar to levels last year. We are driving leverage in G&A as we scale the business. G&A expense was $20 million or 13.7% of revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points from last year. Adjusted operating income increased more than 50% to $16 million, with margins of 11.1%, up over 200 basis points from 8.8% last year, while we continue to make strategic investments to accelerate sales, elevate service and differentiate our products. As typical in the first quarter due to the timing of our bonus payments, adjusted free cash flow was negative $40 million. We expect to generate greater adjusted free cash flow for the full year and for free cash flow margins to expand faster than adjusted operating income as we scale the business. We ended the quarter with $54 million of cash and no debt. For fiscal 2024, we remain focused on execution, scaling the business and driving margin expansion. The demand environment remains resilient with higher top-of-funnel demand than we had a year ago. Our leader value proposition continues to resonate and we’re delivering compelling value for clients to transition from legacy solutions. The labor market remains tight and our guidance assumes flat organic employee growth among existing customers for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter, we expect total revenues of between $154.5 million and $156.5 million or 18% growth at the high end of the range and adjusted operating income of between $19.5 million and $20.5 million. For the full year, we expect revenues of between $648 million to $654 million or 18% growth at the top end of the range, and we anticipate adjusted operating income of $102 million to $106 million. This quarter, we generated $11 million of interest income on average client funds of just over $1 billion at an effective rate of about 425 basis points. Based on current rates, we expect interest income in the range of $44 million to $45 million for the full year. The combination of labor market growth comps moderating year-over-year and larger enterprise customers and embedded a team partner starting provides confidence in our second half revenue growth acceleration. Overall, demand remains healthy and our innovative HCM solution that powers people and performance is winning in the market. We are demonstrating margin expansion as we scale the business and believe there is significant opportunity to drive further leverage. As the mission-critical applications is still early in transition to the cloud, we believe there is significant runway for sustainable growth in the $38 billion HCM market. With that, we’ll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kumar: Hi, this is Kevin Kumar on for Gabriela. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask if there is any changes in how you are thinking about linearity of recurring revenue for the year, particularly any color on enterprise pipeline and overall timing of go lives would be very helpful? Thank you.\nAdam Ante: We talked through a little bit of those enterprise and large partnerships that we are really going to come live and start to contribute more in the back half of the year and things are looking really consistent. So no real change from how we were thinking about it just a couple of months ago, so.\nKevin Kumar: That’s helpful. And then maybe just on cross-selling, how should we maybe think about the cadence of cross-selling for the year? What segments of the market are there opportunities to drive further penetration in modules, particularly talent management?\nRaul Villar: Yes. We’ve had – Kevin, we’ve had really strong, consistent cross-selling across all sizes of the enterprise. Obviously, talent continues to outperform the rest of the portfolio as people are still looking to attract and retain quality associates. And so we feel really good about our cross-selling motion that we have in process there.\nKevin Kumar: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBhavin Shah: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys just speak about what you are seeing in terms of the broker channel and how that’s helping from a repo basis? Have you seen any kind of change there and any kind of sort of the investments you are making into that opportunity?\nRaul Villar: Yes. We are really bullish on the broker channel. The percent contribution to our overall bookings is still around 50% in the field bookings. We continue to focus on our large national partners and we are getting an outsized performance in those cohorts. So, we are excited. We think we have a winning formula with brokers. We grew the number of brokers that we partnered with year-over-year, and we continue to see really solid participation in the channel.\nBhavin Shah: That’s helpful. And I know during the quarter you guys kind of unveiled your embedded HCM solution. Can you just talk a little bit more about the longer term opportunity here and how your go-to-market for this product differs from competitors offering kind of embedded payroll?\nAdam Ante: Yes. So first, we think that there is a huge opportunity. I mean there is thousands of software players who could leverage o service like ours, HCM and payroll capabilities, many of them are trying to offer their own services today and find that when they work through our offering that it just makes more sense to partner with us. And we think that it’s a great go-to-market from that perspective to be able to create – for them to be able to create more compelling a differentiated service really helps us to be able to expand more quickly across services – across markets where we usually have coverage, but we will be able to provide a deeper coverage across more of the market at a faster pace. And in terms of the go-to-market strategy for us, I mean it’s really around finding those winning partnerships and making the right bets on great partners early. And we have had a really strong pipeline, a lot of really great interest and some key partners that are winning already today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Terrell Tillman with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTerrell Tillman: Yes. Hi, Raul, Adam and Rachel. Nice job in the quarter. So, actually I want to build on the embedded HCM question. That’s my first question. It might be a multi-parter, sorry about that, Rachel. But if I heard Adam, I think you said that actually may have contributed 1 point of growth. So, I wanted to confirm that. And then on embedded HCM, it does seem like a pretty big opportunity. Is this something that would support kind of the sustained 20%, or could this actually help even maybe potentially accelerate or have growth drift a little higher? And then I had a follow-up.\nAdam Ante: I think longer term it has an opportunity to really continue to expand our ability to grow at a higher level. I mean I think it’s early, of course, and we want to hit that 20% sustainable in the near-term, but we think that has an opportunity to really continue to accelerate. Again, there is a lot of market opportunity. And like we talk about, half of the entire market is really serviced by these in-house and regional providers. A lot of those are the software providers that we are working with and that we think that are really a great opportunity to partner with. In terms of the contribution, yes, it was about a point of employee growth, that’s going to come on at a slightly lower PEPM, but it did already add about a point of PEPM or employee growth in the quarter.\nTerrell Tillman: That’s great to hear. And then just a follow-up question relates to sales and marketing. It was actually a little lower than what we were forecasting and just kind of the trends year-over-year and sequentially, it’s definitely slower. So, I am curious like – I think Raul, you did say something about productivity of the sales team. Any more color you could share there? And also just – what about seller retention, how is that trending, or was there something else with maybe just certain kind of discretionary marketing that we just didn’t see? Thank you.\nRaul Villar: So, as far as the overall seller cohorts and productivity, they are operating consistently with our expectations and retention has been consistent year-over-year. So, we haven’t seen any changes there. Obviously, our objective always is to continue to increase productivity per rep. While you are adding a big cohort of new people, it’s always favorable to make sure that you can at least maintain the productivity you had in the prior year while adding less productive people into the ecosystem. So, we feel good about that. Obviously, we have to ramp, trained and grow the productivity of that cohort year-over-year, and that’s what we are focused on execution from that perspective.\nAdam Ante: Yes. I think, Terrell, on the full year, we are still going to – we are planning to be in that 32% to 34% of revenue range, which will continue to grow at a good rate. I mean I think there are some dynamics inside of the quarter as well. We moved some of our – a couple of larger programs between Q4 and Q1. So, there might have been a couple of points just back and forth between that. No real difference in the trends, especially as we think about overall sales personnel and marketing programs that we have continued to invest fairly similarly although we do expect to continue to get more scale out of the organization as we are really focused on hiring reps and our sales leaders.\nTerrell Tillman: Alright. Thank you.\nRaul Villar: Thank you.\nAdam Ante: Thanks Terrell.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually Jared on for Bryan tonight. In terms of the demand environment, we heard your commentary about it being solid, but would you say there has been any change relative to last quarter? And then how would you characterize the current demand environment relative to pre-pandemic?\nRaul Villar: Yes. We haven’t seen any changes. It’s been really consistent – what I would tell you is that, we are seeing really strong top-of-the-funnel performance, strong impression, visitors to paycor.com, first-time appointments and win rates are consistent. So, we feel really good about where we are at the top of the funnel. And so the demand environment is strong and holding up.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And then in terms of generative AI, can you discuss the level of client interest in your Gen AI functionality? And how we should think about the potential revenue opportunity there?\nAdam Ante: Yes. I think that it’s still a little early to call the revenue opportunities on generative AI. I think there is a couple of areas that we are using it in the system like job description generator, for example, we were able to roll out pretty quickly. And we have seen a lot of interest, rapid usage, but it’s not something that we are necessarily thinking about charging explicitly for. I mean we are using those underlying GPT models and Azure, and we are seeing a lot of success. We can roll out really quickly. I think there is other areas, though like with our recent analytics capabilities that we are going to launch where we are seeing pretty strong request from a customer perspective, and there will be some opportunity to potentially charge an increased PEPM for that. So, I think it’s going to be a blend. And I think it’s still a little early to call, but I think that, that should take shape maybe over the next couple of quarters, and we will have a little bit better view going into the back half of the year. Thanks Jared.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nScott Berg: Hi everyone. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Raul, I have kind of maybe – or maybe it’s a better question for Adam, but I have kind of an unusual question is, as I look at your income statement, your recurring revenue line item, the growth rate tends to bounce around more than other public vendors in the space and more that I have seen historically. Any reason why that is in a particular quarter over time? I didn’t know if there are some different dynamics going on in the business that would be helpful to understand. But the question I have received from investors more than a few times recently.\nAdam Ante: Yes. Hi Scott, I mean I think over the last, say 4 years, we have really migrated to a PEPM model, the majority of our business on a PEPM model, and we have really driven more consistency in the ongoing growth rates and the recurring growth rates. And it’s really been about addition of new business for us. Also as we have rolled out new services, there may have been some lumpiness and whatnot and then ERC over the last couple of years coming in. But nothing like particular, and I can’t speak to everybody else’s business model per se, but we have been really consistent in our approach over the last 4 years building to the model that we have now, and we have been able to be fairly consistent with that.\nScott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then from a follow-up question perspective, your effective PEPM charge kind of trended down from 15% a couple of quarters ago, almost 6% in the current quarter. How is the cross-sell cadence today maybe versus earlier last year? Is it similar than what you have seen from expansion opportunities or maybe its new customers buying the same amount. How should we think about that metric and how it’s trending over the last couple of months?\nAdam Ante: Yes. The cross-sell contribution to the PEPM growth rate has been really consistent, actually. It tends in that sort of 2 points to 3 points of additional growth from cross-sell. And this year as we have gone from – really what I would say is a more normal rate is in that sort of 8% to 9% range. This quarter, we are in that 6% to – just over 6% growth range and really driven by the two dynamics of the embedded channel, growing a point and then also our enterprise channel grew or Enterprise segment grew a little bit faster. That’s customers over 1,000. And so both of those really accounted for the difference really between that 8 points to 9 points of growth and 6 points, 6.5 points of growth that we are seeing this quarter. But the cross-sell motion has been really consistent. If anything, there is I think, continued opportunity, especially as we have added a lot of great products and expanded the suite over the last couple of years, there continues to be a lot of whitespace there.\nScott Berg: Understood. Thank you. Very helpful.\nAdam Ante: Thanks Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. So, I wanted to follow-up on the embedded opportunity. I just want to understand how quickly can those relationships ramp, both from a technology perspective and working with a potential partner? And then is there a go-to-market motion? I am just curious how to think about that and when we should start to see that ramp up?\nAdam Ante: Yes. Those relationships take a while. I mean from the time you initiate the first conversation until you sign a new business or you are building over – or migrating a portfolio, I mean it can take well over a year. And that cycle is quite a bit longer, and you are navigating a more bespoke service with the partner itself, right? We want to create great technology and integrations that enable a better experience for their customers. And it’s all about setting that up. It’s about setting up the go-to-market capability where we support them, especially early on so that they can get up and running. And then once they board, whether that’s through their portfolio or just signing new business, then it has the chance and the ability to ramp rather quickly. But it’s a long upfront motion from sale to close.\nRaul Villar: Yes. Brian, there are two different types of partners, right. There is partners with an existing portfolio. And they tend to take longer because they may already have a solution, and we have to integrate and ensure that we meet all the feature functionality and needs of the existing platform in the formats that they are accustomed to. Other software partners that don’t currently have an HCM solution or a limited HCM solution are easier to onboard and you start selling new. So, you have to – it’s more of a go-to-market motion every week versus converting a large base. So, there is two different opportunities. We started with the latter with two larger installed bases. And we are – our go-to-market motion has resources targeting both today.\nBrian Peterson: Understood, we get color there. And maybe just on the PEPM expansion, we are seeing more this quarter. How do we think about kind of the annual pace of PEPM expansion over a long-term basis? Thanks guys.\nAdam Ante: Yes. I think that we are probably in a more normal range, so in the sort of mid to upper-single digits from that 6% or so. And it’s going to depended on how pricing trends over the next couple of years. We are continuing to see opportunity to expand our pricing through additional services and expanding the suite. So, we are wrapping all of that together. And then again, you are going to see a little bit more of this pressure from – versus where we have been recently with the addition of some of the embedded channel and a little bit more in the upper market of the Enterprise segment. But I think that sort of 6%-plus to 6%, 8% range probably makes sense for us.\nBrian Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMark Marcon: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I also have questions on the embedded solution. Can you just give us some more examples of the types of software partners that you are partnering with? And how does it work in terms of the relationship with the client? The platform is going to be with their brand. And so I am wondering how does customer service work? How does pricing work? How does the revenue share work? And how should we think about the margin implications?\nRaul Villar: Mark, it’s Raul. Thanks for the 16 questions. I appreciate it. I will try to remember them all. So, I think when you think about it from a targeting prospecting perspective, think about vertical software stacks across many different types of industries that are going to market and delivering either a ERP or a workforce management tool are two good examples. And what they are really looking for is something sticky and predictable inside the stack. And so that’s what we are offering. And so a lot of great targets for us are in that, call it, $10 million to $250 million in revenue that are looking to expand PEPM inside their base, looking to increase their stickiness. And so there is a whole bunch of tech companies that fit that model. Many of them are PE-backed that we think are really attractive and excited about this type of opportunity. As far as the combination of who does what, that’s configurable by partner. Obviously, the payroll and HCM product is ours and we’re going to integrate it into their application. But ultimately, who does the implementation and who does the service, that really has an impact on the economics, right? And so we’re flexible based on the partner needs. And that’s how you should think about it. Adam, anything you would add?\nAdam Ante: Yes. I mean on the revenue model, it’s going to be pretty straightforward in terms of – we will build the partner and the partner will go to market with whatever their own pricing strategy is. So whether they want to build it into their own pricing or bundle it out separately, there is no revenue share.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then as we’re moving up market in terms of size of clients, how should we think about the fee gross profit margin exclusive of the float, how should that trend?\nAdam Ante: I mean the gross profit margin across many of our segments is fairly consistent, actually. So what we see is that once you get out of the sort of sub-10 employee, sub-15 employee range, the gross margin tends to be fairly consistent. And then it’s really about the sort of services and the amount of products that our customers are buying really will ultimately determine the overall margin of that client because payroll ends up being the majority of where the operating cost goes into supporting the client between tax service and operations and general support management.\nRaul Villar: Yes, Mark, I think what’s exciting for us is, from the beginning, and you were with us at the IPO, our objective was to continue to shift up market. And our new bookings this quarter the average size is double our current employee base. So we’re significantly outpacing on average. Our pay sizes moving up market. And so we’re really excited about the progress that the sales team has made, the product team has made and the operations team has made to be able to support that ecosystem.\nMark Marcon: Thanks, Raul\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Phil on for Siti. When you guys look at the workforce levels across your customer base, are there any particular verticals that you’re seeing weaker or stronger levels? Any kind of color would be helpful.\nRaul Villar: Yes, Phil, obviously, we’re a broad solution that serves all industries. However, that being said, in the four industries that we are focused on, I would say, we’ve seen strength in food and beverage in professional services over the quarter and slight moderation in manufacturing and healthcare. But on the average, it’s delivered our expected outcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArti Vula: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. This is Arti on for Mark Murphy. First question is, if you guys have seen any kind of divergences. I know you guys said the demand overall has been steady and solid, but any divergence in terms of segment geography and market or kind of any other dimension? Thanks.\nAdam Ante: Hye, Arti. Yes, I mean, not really. It’s been fairly consistent, right? As we’ve looked at the macro market and you look at broader non-farm payroll growth, trending down, but still very steady, a little sequential decline. And I think we’re seeing similar – I mean we’re seeing – it’s really similar to that. And so consistency over the last couple of quarters haven’t seen any big divergence really in any of the markets or definitely not inside of the portfolio.\nArti Vula: And then just as a quick follow-up. As you guys are kind of moving into the Tier 1 cities and being pulled up market, any changes in who you’re seeing in competition or win rates or anything along those lines?\nRaul Villar: No, win rates are consistent. And from who we see, we still see ADP, Paylocity, Paycom, would be the three competitors we see the most in the market. ADP either as an incumbent or a competitor. But ultimately, those are the three we see that hasn’t changed. When we started our journey, they were all national providers in every market. And so there is no real market differentiation within HCM from that perspective.\nArti Vula: Got it. And the win rates across those three have been relatively stable as well?\nRaul Villar: Yes.\nArti Vula: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess I’ll ask another question on the embedded HCM. But I guess I just want to understand a little bit more on, it seems like really good strength of the back here. But how are you feeling about what’s embedded in the outlook for the rest of the year? And then as we think about the margin profile of embedded HCM, how is that maybe different versus the core payroll solution?\nAdam Ante: Hi, Steve. We feel good about the guidance that we’ve shared that it includes the future growth of these – of the channel and performance thus far. So we still feel good, and that’s really consistent with how we came into the year. In terms of the margin and the margin profile will be a little bit stronger because you don’t have quite as much on the cost of acquisition side, right? So we don’t have to maintain sales distribution, you don’t have quite the same level of implementation cost and you’re supporting the partner versus the front-end customers. So a little bit different model and a little bit better margin. I’d say earlier on, like through this year, you’re not going to see any material benefits necessarily in the margin profile as we’ve invested in the channel. But that will come really ‘25, ‘26 will continue to be additive to the margin as we grow the channel over time.\nSteve Enders: Okay. That’s helpful context there. And then as you think about the Tier 1 investments that you’ve been making, and I guess, kind of the geographic footprint today. I guess where are you going to call out the – kind of any change in the pockets of strength there or any areas that maybe were a little bit softer out there? And just in general, how are you feeling about this Tier 1 investments in the ramp up there?\nRaul Villar: Yes. Tier 1 continues to be the bulk of our investment. It’s also the lion share of our performance and growth. So we feel really good about that. We’re seeing really good results from an average deal size, number of employees, above the line average. So we feel like it’s really good. As far as like individual markets, when we’re performing well or poorly, it’s all about the execution of the team on the field. It’s really not – at this point, we’ve seen no macro impact in any market that we have. It’s more about – do we have a great leader, are we fully staffed and are they running the playbook. And if they are doing that, we performed really well. When we are missing one of those things, we won’t perform as well as we are in the other markets.\nSteve Enders: Yes. Prefect. Thanks for taking the questions here. \nRaul Villar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Jester: Hey, great. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe we can spend a minute talking about your partnership with Azure and the [indiscernible] analytics solution. I guess maybe can we generalize this, is this a type of partnership that you might see more from you in terms of going to sort of best-of-breed solutions and seeing if you can use it to accelerate your own product opportunity or is this maybe more of a one-off given the need around the [indiscernible] analytics today?\nAdam Ante: Yes, I mean, we look at partnership opportunities just like we look at acquisition opportunities and/or developing the solutions themselves. I mean I think in this case, we really like the partnership with Azure. And we didn’t think we were going to be able to get to what they have built. They have been a great partner. They knew what they were doing. And we’ve been able to build something together. I mean they work with us very well and directly with our product organization to create this solution to be able to take it to market through this channel rapidly. And so we really appreciate that partnership with them. I think we would consider other partnerships, but it’s not like a change in the strategy necessarily. I don’t think that you’re going to see one direction, one way or the other, more or less.\nRaul Villar: Yes. I think it’s – we identified them as best of breed. It wasn’t something we could do right away. Ryan is a great partner. We really enjoy the relationship and we’re developing stuff together, which is creating more power for both of our platform. So we’re excited about it, and we want to continue to grow our relationship with them.\nDaniel Jester: Great. That’s really helpful. Thank you. And then I think you touched on this earlier, but maybe we can just circle back to it. In terms of the percent of your revenue base today, that’s still being paid on a per-check basis as opposed to PEPM, kind of where does that roughly sit today? Thank you very much.\nAdam Ante: Yes. We have about quarter of our portfolio that has some form of a per-check model, although half of that revenue – they are also buying other HCM solutions that are on PEPM model. And this is really over the last 5 years, migrated from 20% or less than 20% to nearly 80% of the portfolio is now on a – on some PEPM strategy. And also 100% of the new business that we sell comes on, on a PEPM strategy.\nRaul Villar: Yes. And I would just like to interject that 99% plus – 99% of our payrolls are already perfect. And so we have – we don’t really have an issue with trying to generate revenue from client mistakes.\nDaniel Jester: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Yes. Great. Just wanted to ask on the customer list acquisition that you made a few quarters ago. Just an update on how that’s progressing relative to your expectations in terms of converting those customers.\nAdam Ante: Yes, Matt, things are progressing really well. We had a really great success with that portfolio and bringing it over pretty quickly. It’s all really coming together here in the first quarter. So really nothing to add necessarily in the quarter, but on track for the expectations that we have sort of going into the year on that portfolio.\nMatt Pfau: Great. And then just a follow-up on the employee retention credit. I think you had a small amount of revenue from that previously, it’s program has been paused now. Is there anything in guidance going forward included from that?\nAdam Ante: Yes. I mean the program hasn’t been paused in that – it’s not still processing and the IRS still is processing. I mean, we had expectations to receive a little bit of ERC-related revenues. And I think it’s going to come in close to our expectations. I mean, we’re anticipating something around 1 point of our revenue for the whole year related to ERC, and I think it’s going to be relatively consistent to that.\nRaul Villar: And Q1 was on track.\nAdam Ante: Q1 was on track, yes.\nMatt Pfau: Perfect. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you so much. I wonder can you give us a sense of how much pricing overall contributed to 2023 revenue? And how should we think about that in terms of what’s embedded ‘24?\nAdam Ante: Yes. Kevin, you are little soft there. I think the question was around price, how much did pricing impact FY ‘23? Yes. I mean, normally – and the way that we sort of think about it is how much of our PEPM growth comes from pricing actions and about third of it tends to come from pricing. And so that could be 2 to 3 points or so depending on the overall growth. And then we have some specific programs and some new services that we released also in Q3 of last year that we talked about that added up to that 15% PEPM growth was a little bit more outsized there with some new services that were primarily around year-end fee services. So traditionally or typically we would see about third of that growth related to some sort of pricing.\nKevin McVeigh: And then if you think about, Adam, the realization versus kind of the book on the PEPM. You see that narrowing kind of, because I think you quoted $17 or something like that realization versus $51 at kind of book, if you would. Any thoughts as to the convergence there?\nAdam Ante: Yes, I think it’s going to take some time for it to converge all the way to the top end. I mean, I think the fact is, is we’re growing our product suite faster than our ability to drive 100% penetration and attach. And so it’s going to take some time. I mean you’re growing the suite out and expanding really the bundle pricing model, which helps us at the point of sale on new business, which is part of what’s helping drive up the continued PEPM growth. And then you had to go back and drive the cross-sell motion into the base. And that just takes a little bit longer. So – and then the team has been great at being able to add new solutions and products to the suite at an outsized rate relative to the rest of the competitive set and the other solutions in the market. So I don’t think it’s going to converge in any near-term. And I think it’s going to be steady over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Simmons with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Hey, thanks for taking the question. So your guidance looks like it implies recurring revenue accelerate something like 2 points in the second half of the year from first half. I guess, how much is that from those ramping partnerships in the embedded solution? And how much are other factors? Why would first half is slower than second half?\nAdam Ante: Yes. I mean it was really – as we were adding some of these partnerships last year and coming into the year we really talked about – and there was a couple of dynamics that led to a lower Q4, Q1 number and going into the back half of what is now FY ‘24. And yes, some of that’s going to be the enterprise. Some of that is going to be the partnerships. And then there is also a little bit of continued same-store sales that we’re not going to have the same headwind going into the back half of the year as well. So most of it is just the visibility to what we’re going to see here coming up in January and starting in our fiscal Q3, which is the January quarter and giving us the confidence to the full year, which has been consistent with how we thought about it the last couple of quarters now.\nRobert Simmons: Got it. And then last year, your seasonality was a little bit skewed 3Q, 4Q. Should we expect that to normalize this year, which would kind of suggest maybe a lower 3Q growth rate or higher 4Q growth rate or what should we think?\nAdam Ante: Yes. I think you’re going to see 3Q normalizes a little bit. There was a little bit of trade with ERC between 3Q and 4Q. And that’s really not going to be as much of a factor as – I think we will continue to see 3Q normalize over time just as the year-end fees become a smaller and smaller portion of our portfolio.\nRobert Simmons: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would now hand the conference over to Raul Villar Jr. for his closing comments.\nRaul Villar: Thank you again for joining us tonight. We are encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of the business and remain focused on executing our strategy. We look forward to connecting with you at several upcoming events, including the TD Cowen HCM Summit. Have a great night, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference of Paycor has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."
