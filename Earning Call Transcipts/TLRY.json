Also joining us for the question-and-answer segment are Denise Faltischek, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of International; Blair MacNeil, President of Tilray Canada; and Ty Gilmore, President of our U.S. Beer business. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tilray Brands' Chairman and CEO, Irwin Simon.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you, Berrin, and good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. We thank you for your continued support of Tilray Brands and for joining our call today. Over the last several quarters, we have been articulating what truly sets Tilray Brands apart, our diversified business model of cannabis CPG lifestyle brands all operating under our strategy innovation, which we believe will drive our continued growth and future success, as we demonstrated by our record revenue in Q2. With the dedication and efforts of our more than 2,300 employees worldwide, we have created a global portfolio of beloved brands and innovative high-quality products backed by best-in-class operations, facilities and robust distribution that supports our goal to become a multi-billion dollar company. Our four distinct and complementary business segments consist of: cannabis consisting of adult-use and medical cannabis across a broad portfolio of product formats, including whole flower, pre-rolls, vapes, concentrates, oils, edibles, topicals and THC-infused drinks; beverages, including craft beer, spirits, ready-to-drink flavored malt beverages, ciders and energy drinks and non-alcohol beverages; wellness, which consists of our Manitoba Harvest hemp-based food products, ingredients and snacks, as well as our hemp-based CBD infused beverages; and of course, our European medical distribution business, which distributes pharmaceuticals including medical cannabis. In Q2, we continued to focus on organic growth as well as strategic transactions. In Canada, we maintained our number one market share position with our recent HEXO and Truss acquisitions, which drove considerable cost savings and operational efficiencies. We continue to strengthen our market positions, operations, distribution network and innovation across both medical and adult-use markets. Internationally, we continue to grow our existing medical markets and strengthen our medical distribution and medical cannabis operations through a relentless focus on cost and efficiencies. And finally, we've expanded our beverage alcohol business with our recent acquisition of eight iconic brands from Anheuser-Busch, which tripled our beer business from 4 million in cases a year to 12 million cases on an annualized basis. We remain committed to our vision of changing people's lives for the better, one person at a time. Guided by this purpose, we are inspiring and empowering the worldwide community to live their very best life, enhanced by moments of connections and well-being. At the same time, we've earned the trust of our stakeholders, patients, consumers, communities and partners across the spectrum of our wellness and lifestyle products. In doing so, we're delivering on our mission to be the most responsible, trusted and market-leading cannabis and consumer products company across the globe. In fact, through our strategic execution and achievements, our business are comprised of: a leading global cannabis business operating best-in-class portfolio of brands with high-quality products that pass the most rigorous quality control regulations in the world with the number one market share in Canada and leading market share in Europe; the fifth largest craft brewer in the U.S. with highly sought-after brands dominating key regions across Northeast, Pacific Northwest and Southeast; and one of the most awarded bourbon brands with Breckenridge Distillery with recent awards, including Best American Blended Whiskey, Best Whiskey Under $50 and 2003 World's Best Blended Whiskey at the World Whiskey Awards. And we're also leader in hemp foods and snacks with our Manitoba Harvest brand. Diversifying our business beyond cannabis has put us in a very strong position today and has positioned us well for future growth opportunities. Today, we do not engage in any cannabis operations in the U.S., due to it being federally illegal. If that and when rescheduling of cannabis were to happen in the U.S., for Tilray Brands, we expect this would open the opportunity for certain institutional investors to invest in Tilray, and that were not previously able to invest in the cannabis industry and potentially provide a path for Tilray to sell pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis in the U.S., subject to doctor prescriptions. As you know, Tilray is a leading medical cannabis provider in the world. With our knowledge and expertise in medical cannabis and the regulatory compliance that apply, we're well positioned to participate in a federally legalized medical market in the U.S. Our underlining goal for Tilray Brands is to continue to deliver industry-leading profitable growth and sustainable long-term shareholder value through our focus on three fundamentals: number one, maximizing profitable revenue growth through organic growth and expansion initiatives as well as key strategic acquisitions with strong synergy opportunities; realizing the benefits of optimized asset utilization and cost management to ensure a lean, efficient cost structure across all our business segments; and continuing to strengthen our industry-leading balance sheet and our cash position. During Q2, we generated record net revenue for Tilray Brands of $194 million, which marked a 34% growth from the prior-year period, and generated gross profit of $47 million and adjusted gross profit of $52 million. We also significantly reduced our convertible debt by $127 million in the quarter, an additional $18 million after the quarter, and plan to further reduce our indebtedness, optimizing our capital structure and enhancing our financial flexibility. Now moving to our businesses. We grew our Canadian net revenue by 31% in the quarter compared to the previous year, driven by innovation across all product categories. This was achieved both organically and due to recent acquisition despite price compression of approximately $3.6 million from the prior-year quarter, which also negatively impacts offline revenue and profitability. Tilray continues to maintain the number one market share position in Canada, the largest federally legal cannabis market in the world, with approximately 12.5% market share in adult-use cannabis. This is 570 basis points ahead of the next LP. Tilray leads Canadian adult-use cannabis sales and is number one in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which represents approximately 60% of the Canadian population on a combined basis. We're also number one in cannabis flower, oils, concentrates and THC beverages, and number two in pre-rolls, number four in vape, and the top 10 on all other categories, all while operating under rigorous high-quality control standards. In Q2, Tilray sold approximately 17 million grams of cannabis flower, 19 million pre-rolls and over 1.5 million units of cannabis beverages, almost 500,000 vapes, and over 400,000 units of edibles in Canada. And we expect to sell 85 million pre-rolls by the end of fiscal 2024. Our August purchase of the remaining 57.5% equity ownership of Truss Beverage Company from Molson's Canada elevated our market share in THC beverages to approximately 40% and positions us at the forefront of adult-use beverage sector, where we trusted by patients, healthcare professionals and government officials in over 20 countries and achieved early-mover advantage in new countries as medical cannabis legalization advances. During Q2, we grew our international cannabis net revenue by 55%, and are the market leader in medical cannabis across Europe, with leading shares in Germany and Poland and other countries in which we participate. Similar to the U.S., the growth of our international cannabis business is not dependent on adult-use legalization. We continue to take an active government relations role internationally. And just recently, we met with various members of German parliament to discuss the proposed regulation and advancing adult-use medical cannabis initiatives, which we believe will increase the accessibility of medical cannabis to patients in Germany and further work to reduce any stigma of medical cannabis as therapeutical option. We're also optimistic about the potential abolishment of the tender procedure for in-country cultivation in favor of permit procedures, providing Tilray with the flexibility to meet the needs of patients. It is expected that these regulations will be passed in the first quarter of calendar 2024. We remain committed to advancing medical cannabis as evidenced by our investments made in Europe behind our high-quality medical cannabis products and best-in-class facilities in Portugal, Germany where we're currently one of the only three companies in Germany that can cultivate in country as well as our medical distribution network, led by our integrated medical distribution company with access to approximately 13,000 pharmacies. We also remain committed to medical cannabis education and research. In October, we announced our support of an independent clinical trial to research the efficacy of medical cannabis as a treatment for glioblastoma. Tilray Pharma, also known as CC Pharma, is an established medical distribution platform for traditional, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as medical cannabis across 13,000 pharmacies as well as wholesalers and distributors. From a revenue perspective, it is currently equal in size to our cannabis segment, comprising of 35% of total sales. In Q2, it grew 12% from the prior-year period, driven by improved procurement of pharmaceutical products and increased demand. From a bottom-line perspective, we are laser-focused on optimizing our medical distribution platform. In the quarter, we expect the cost optimization plan to reduce costs with the medical distribution segment by $1.5 million annually. The actions to achieve these savings were already executed in the quarter, and we continue to evaluate for further cost optimization and production efficiencies. Now turning to our beverage alcohol business. Beverage alcohol revenue in Q2 was $46.5 million, representing a 117% growth year-over-year, and we're only getting started in ramping up this segment. The craft beer industry today is still a large category in beverage alcohol, with approximately 21 billion at retail in 2022. With our recent acquisition of eight iconic craft beer and beverage brands, we have anchored Tilray's leadership position as the fifth largest craft brewer in the U.S. by sales volume. Working with the Boston Consulting Group, we have developed a beverage strategy, identifying new opportunities for pockets of growth across craft beverages, focusing on brand newness, being more connected to drinkers, and by playing the leading role in driving excitement around craft beer to a broader consumer audience through product innovation, marketing sponsorships and events that connect with consumers across demographics. Tilray Brands is now uniquely positioned to become a Top 12 beer and alcohol beverage company by leveraging our portfolio to win more occasions through core products such as craft beer and beyond through innovation into categories, like flavored malt beverages, ready-to-drink cocktails and spirits. This will be accomplished through a three-pronged approach. We will deploy a regional approach to scale our brands in key markets across the U.S. and maximize potential of the portfolio to gain share from competitors. We will execute a very focused national brand strategy, revitalizing Shock Top to win as national craft brands by targeting share and connection occasion to reach mainstream male and female beer drinkers. Through one national brand and many regional brands, we will provide robust coverage across the U.S. and other countries. We will expand our innovation strategy to increase brand appeal to new consumers and occasions beyond craft beer in secondary targets. We can also leverage our regional footholds to further grow our brands in new markets by using test and learn tactics, which may include multi-brand, best-of-variety packs or installing multi-brand taps and taprooms before entering the market with full distribution. We can similarly capture new consumers and increase off-premise consumption through breakneck innovations. We will build on our demonstrated success growing brands such as SweetWater and Montauk to grow our newly acquired consumer-loved brands, including Shock Top, Blue Point, Breckenridge Brewery, 10 Barrel, Redhook Brewery, Widmer Brothers, Square Mile Cider and HiBall Energy. Our strategic playbook is already in play to expand our beverage alcohol business across the U.S. and Canada, and getting our cost structure right, transforming the productivity and profitability of the breweries we acquire, we expect our beer gross margins to increase once we fully realize the cost savings achieved in connection with our fully integrated beverage alcohol platform. We are aggressively working to launch new innovation across our beer and non-alcoholic craft brands and expect to roll out new products in Q3. Retailer and distribution enthusiasm has already provided confidence in our ability to execute on our growth strategy and to achieve our ambitions to grow our beverage segment into a Top 12 business. Finally, our wellness segment is an important element of our U.S. strategy, due to strong consumer interest in better-for-you snacks and end products. Since the Tilray and Aphria business combination, we turned around the Manitoba Harvest business onto a path of growth and greater potential. Again, product innovation is a core focus, meeting the needs of Gen Z and millennial consumers through new hemp forward snack foods and supplement offering in CBD beverages that fuel your day. While Q2 revenue was consistent of $12.9 million, Manitoba Harvest branded hemp business continues to expand its U.S. and Canadian leading market share with consumption up in both natural and conventional channels with the brand's top five customers all seeing growth. To conclude, we've set the stage for continued growth in the near and long term, and consider opportunities across our diversified business both numerous and exciting, as we continue to disrupt the global CPG industry with products that fuel consumers' needs and change people's lives for the better, one person at a time. In everything that we do, we intentionally do to maximize profitability, sustainable revenue and ensure optimal efficiencies, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength as we invest in our industry-leading brands. With that, I will now turn the call over to Carl to discuss our financials in greater detail. Carl?\nCarl Merton: Thank you, Irwin. As a reminder, our financial results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. We are also referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results throughout our discussion today, and our earnings press release contains a reconciliation of our reported results under GAAP to the non-GAAP measures identified during our remarks. Let's now review our quarterly performance for the three months ended November 30, 2023. Q2 total revenue rose to a record $194 million compared to the prior-year quarter at $144 million, representing 34% growth. And our legacy businesses grew 10% organically, when excluding acquisitions and the HEXO advisory fee. By segment, cannabis net revenue rose 35% in total, with international cannabis up 55% and Canadian cannabis up 31%, despite $3.6 million of price compression in Canada. Price compression not only negatively impacts top-line revenue, but also profitability, as it would have dropped to the bottom-line. Cannabis excise taxes, which are a reduction to revenue, totaled $27.4 million compared to $16.8 million last year. This reflected a sharp increase in cannabis revenue generated in Canada versus the year-ago period, due in part to the HEXO and Truss acquisitions and a change in our revenue mix to higher excise tax products. Note that excise tax is predominantly computed as a fixed price on grams sold rather than as a percentage of the selling price, and therefore continues to become a larger component of net revenue, particularly as current growth categories like infused pre-rolls and concentrates become the biggest part of our sales mix. While an excise tax force has been established to present these challenges to the Minister of Finance in Canada, we do not believe some level of reform is likely in the near term. Still, about two-thirds of LPs have excise taxes owed, and this could lead to additional insolvencies and even more industry consolidation, which is needed to stabilize the industry. Distribution revenue from our Tilray Pharma, also known as CC Pharma, European medical distribution business rose 12%, net beverage alcohol revenue rose 117%, and wellness revenue rose 2%. The inherent benefits of our diversified business model are reflected in this segment contributions to our overall revenue mix. We are not overly dependent on any business line from a top-line or gross profit standpoint, and believe each segment, including cannabis, wellness, distribution and beverage alcohol, are on a trajectory for sustainable growth. In Q2, our cannabis segment represented about 35% of our total revenue mix comparable to last year; distribution segment represented 35%, down from 42% last year; beverage alcohol represented 24%, up from 15% last year; and wellness represented about 7%, down from 9% last year, respectively. These percentage changes from Q2 last year are due primarily to contributions from HEXO, Truss and the new craft beverage brands acquired in early October. Next quarter, we believe the mix will balance to approximately 30% cannabis, 30% distribution, 30% beverage alcohol and 10% wellness. Diversification is also reflected in our geographic footprint, with about 60% of our net revenue from North America and slightly less than 40% from EMEA, with the remainder from other parts of the world. Turning to profitability. Gross profit increased 11% to $47.4 million compared to $42.9 million in the prior-year quarter, while gross margin decreased to 24% from 30% in the prior-year quarter. While gross margin for U.S. GAAP purposes declined from the prior year, adjusted gross margin, exclusive of the impacts of the HEXO advisory fee which ceased after we purchased HEXO, rose to 27% compared to 26%. I will discuss adjusted gross margin by individual segment in a moment. Net loss improved to $46.2 million compared to net loss of $61.6 million in the prior-year quarter. On a per share basis, this amounted to net loss of $0.07 versus $0.11 in the prior-year quarter. During Q2, we renegotiated a supply agreement between Aphria Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, and Aphria Diamond, a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, that is expected to result in $33 million annually in additional income being allocated to Tilray shareholders as opposed to the non-controlling interests. Further, as part of this renegotiation, we believe we will save more than $22 million annually in cash income taxes. The renegotiated supply agreement was effective September 1, 2023. If this amended agreement had been implemented at the onset of the fiscal year, it would have improved our loss per share attributable to Tilray shareholders by $0.02 for Q1, which would have increased the value attributable to Tilray stockholders by $15 million. Despite all of this, we still expect to pay over $140 million in Canadian excise tax this year. Beginning this quarter, we are introducing two new reporting metrics to our discussions: adjusted net income loss and adjusted earnings per share. The definitions of both are identified in the press release, along with the relevant reconciliations and calculations. For the quarter, we are reporting an adjusted net loss of $2.7 million, which when calculated on a per share basis resulted in EPS of $0 for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.1 million, down from $11 million in the prior-year quarter. This was consistent with the termination of the HEXO advisory services contract upon our acquisition of HEXO, which represented $7.8 million of the $11 million in adjusted EBITDA in the prior-year period. During the quarter, we continued to make great progress against the HEXO synergy plan, increasing the amount of the synergy from $27 million to between $30 million and $35 million. As of the end of the quarter, we achieved $22 million in annualized savings on an annualized run rate basis, of which $14 million represented actual cost savings during the period. These synergies are being achieved via consolidating packaging, procurement, freight and logistics. Operating cash flow was negative $30.4 million compared to positive $29.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in cash used during Q2 this year was primarily related to the settlement of pre-acquisition liabilities assumed in connection with the HEXO acquisition and an increase in accounts receivable in the current period. Also, the prior period included a working capital reduction and the cash collection of $18.3 million from HTI related to the HEXO convertible note, which did not recur in the current year. Turning now to our business segments. Gross cannabis revenue of $94.6 million was comprised of $72 million in Canadian adult-use revenue, $11.9 million in international cannabis revenue, $6.3 million in Canadian medical revenue, and $4.3 million in wholesale cannabis revenue. Net cannabis revenue was $67.1 million, representing a 35% increase from the year-ago period. The positive variance related to increased organic growth of over 11% and the acquisitions of HEXO and Truss. Offsetting the increase in net cannabis revenue was the elimination of the advisory services revenue from the prior-year quarter due to the HEXO acquisition, which terminated the previous strategic arrangement that was in place. International cannabis grew 55%, largely because of the expansion into emerging international medical markets. Additionally, in the prior period, the company recognized a one-time return adjustment of $3.1 million related to a former customer in Israel. Cannabis gross profit was $20.6 million and cannabis gross margin was 31% compared to $21.3 million and 43% in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the HEXO advisory fee and return adjustment in the prior-year quarter and the wholesale sale in the current quarter, adjusted cannabis gross margin increased to 37% from 33%. As I just referenced, a portion of the decrease in gross profit was a result of the termination of the HEXO services agreement. This agreement contributed nil of gross profit in the current year compared to $7.8 million in the prior year. Additionally, we made a significant wholesale transaction that resulted in negative gross profit of $0.2 million. We entered into this agreement to optimize our inventory levels and prioritize the generation of positive operating cash flow. European distribution revenue, derived predominantly through CC Pharma, increased 12% to $67.2 million from $60.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by the strengthening of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, increased capacity through outsourcing the third-party production facilities, as well as leveraging internal production and improved procurement processes. This has allowed Tilray Pharma to improve its product mix. We also continue to be focused on optimizing portfolio and production capacity to prevent constraints on continued revenue growth. Tilray Pharma gross profit decreased to $7.1 million compared to $7.7 million in the prior year. Tilray Pharma gross margin decreased to 11% from 13% in the prior-year quarter, which was due to product mix. Beverage alcohol revenue was $46.5 million, up 117% from $21.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The positive delta was due to contributions from increased organic growth of over 10% and our Montauk Brewery acquisition last November and the newly acquired brands acquired in early October this year. Beverage alcohol gross profit increased to $16 million compared to $10 million, while average -- beverage alcohol gross margin decreased to 34% from 47% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted gross margin from beverage alcohol from our legacy business was 54.8%, up from the prior-year quarter of 47%. Adjusted gross margin from our newly acquired craft brands was 21%. Irwin has previously addressed the efforts we are extending to improve the newly acquired craft brands adjusted gross margins to levels consistent with our legacy beer adjusted gross margins. Wellness revenue was relatively consistent at $12.9 million compared to $12.7 million in the prior-year quarter, with the increase being driven by a promotional sale at a large bulk retailer. Wellness gross profit was $3.7 million, down from $3.9 million in the prior-year quarter and gross margin fell to 29% from 31% as we experienced a change in sales mix towards more bulk retail sales, which have a lower margin that is specific for this quarter. Our cash and marketable securities balance as of November 30th was $261.4 million, down from $433.5 million in the year-ago period. The majority of the decrease related to the redemption of the Tilray '23 convertible notes upon maturity in the amount of $107.3 million combined with litigation settlements inherited from acquired businesses and HEXO costs. Having now completed half of our fiscal year, we are reiterating our fiscal '24 guidance of adjusted EBITDA between $68 million and $78 million. Note that when we first issued this guidance, we projected a significant step-up in EBITDA contributions during the second half of the year, most particularly in Q4, which we continue to anticipate. This step-up is a function of our beer business, leading up to the summer, a historically busy season, the new innovation scheduled to be launched as part of the spring reset, certain volume guarantees associated with our spirits business and in our distribution business as pharmacies buy in bulk [indiscernible] customers ahead of them going on vacation. Recall that we also project positive adjusted free cash flow from operations, excluding our integration costs from HEXO, Truss, the newly acquired brands, and the cash income taxes related to Aphria Diamond. We are also managing CapEx and working to strengthen our industry-leading balance sheet. Let me now conclude our prepared remarks and open the lines for questions from our covering analysts. Operator, what's the first question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Andrew Carter from Stifel. Please proceed with your question, sir.\nAndrew Carter: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So, looking at back half guidance, I appreciate kind of what you just said. But if I've got my math right, then you need $16 million to $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the second half of the year. And then you've got $25 million second half last year from HEXO fees. So, $35 million to $45 million of incremental EBITDA to meet the guidance in the second half. Could you talk about kind of stepped up seasonality, how much that's going to contribute, incremental synergy capture year-over-year or making progress on kind of the ABI -- the ABI craft brands, gross margin, how much would be in second half? And then kind of one more within this quarter, how much was kind of one-time costs associated with the ABI, obviously not things you excluded, that could swing to profit second half and help that number? Thank you.\nCarl Merton: Thanks, Andrew. So, just in terms of a number of the items, first off, when we look at the HEXO and Truss acquisitions, we've increased our synergy target to $30 million to $35 million. We already have $22 million of that and got $14 million of it in the most recent quarter. So, you're going to see that flow through the historic HEXO numbers through the end of the year. We're seeing increased seasonality in the cannabis -- the Canadian cannabis business in Q4. We see increased seasonality every year in the distribution business in Q4, every year except for the two years of COVID. And that's really driven by pharmacy stocking up on medicines in advance of the summer months when a lot of Germans disappear from Germany for their holidays over the summer and they buy in advance. As you go through and we look at the ABI transaction -- sorry, the newly acquired brands, what we're seeing is even more seasonality than SweetWater, and we all know what happened last year with SweetWater and Montauk in the fourth quarter. And so, we see profitability increases there as well. We have a couple of internal cost savings plans that are going to net us about $5 million over the back half of the year. And we have invested immensely in new innovation for both ABI and for SweetWater for that spring reset in the back half of the year.\nIrwin Simon: And Andrew, I think the big thing is this here, you got to remember, we closed on the ABI deal only two months ago. So, we really didn't get any benefits from it. But you got to step back. Our beer business was up 10% in this quarter, where traditional beer businesses have been down or flat. So, we're seeing some good organic growth from our beer business. We're seeing good organic growth from our cannabis business. You saw what happened in Europe. You saw what happened in our Canadian market, and that's even with price compression. So, let's step back, you heard what we said. We increased our synergies that we're going to get now from the HEXO deal, $30 million to $35 million. We are only operating that for about three months. We closed on Truss. We're consolidating that business into our London facility. And we have a major market share on that. So, we're well positioned. I think the big thing is how do we take and get organic growth is key, number one. Number two is cost savings. And we put in place very early on or just at a corporate tier, we've taken about $5 million, $6 million and then focusing on the integration of the HEXO business, the Truss business and the ABI deal. And then last but not least, we got a lot of innovation coming out in our product line, both in beer and cannabis. So, we feel there's a good path to achieve the back half.\nAndrew Carter: Second question, just from Canada, you mentioned the price compression ongoing obviously at a much lower rate, but it's still a headwind to the profit. You also mentioned mix going kind of where the consumer is, that's degradation. I mean, at a certain point looking at Canada, do you see the profit pool increasing? And I guess, risk -- you mentioned two-thirds of LPs aren't paying kind of regressive tax -- taxes owed. Do you see any risks there that number one, enforcement obviously isn't happening? But number two, there could be settlements or whatever that could make basically the whole kind of Canada adult-use market just a very difficult value proposition overall to where you would kind of reconsider investment in that? Thanks.\nIrwin Simon: So, we'll step back for a second. Listen, Canada is the only market in the world where recreational cannabis is legal. We have one of the largest share. We're number one in Ontario, number one in Quebec and number one in British Columbia, which is over 60% of the population. What we're seeing in Canada, yes, we don't like price compression and we got a 12.5%, 13% share with our next competitor out there, about 4.5% share points lower. What we have to focus on is a couple of things. More and more sales, number one. Number two, taking more and more cost out. You heard Carl talk about renegotiating our agreement and taking costs out of our agreement with our grower. As we bring HEXO in there, we're looking to take $35 million of total cost out of there. But as we grow sales, we will now grow -- we will now sell 18 million, 19 million pre-rolls a year. We'll sell more and more flower. The big thing is organic growth and taking out more and more cost ultimately. Listen, the industry is only five years old. I come back and I say this year, more LPs will go away, more consumers will get educated about cannabis and the cannabis market will grow. I see a big opportunity in the beverage category for us in the Canadian market and the edibles. And listen, with our infrastructure in Canada and now having a facility in Belleville and London, it doesn't stop us from going into the beverage business, the beer business, the craft beer businesses or other businesses in Canada to offset some of our costs of our infrastructure to diversify like we've done in the U.S. So, we're committed to the Canadian market, and we think there's a lot of opportunities there.\nAndrew Carter: Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nAaron Grey: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for the question. So, for me, I just want to touch on some of the comments you made in terms of potential we're scheduling in the U.S. and opportunities on the medical side. So, assuming if it might be Schedule III, as many people predict it might be, can you speak to how you think you'd be able to leverage your Canadian and European expertise? You spoke to prescriptions. Do you think there need to be additional steps in terms of the current existing framework of the U.S. to participate in terms of selling into pharmacies, or do you think you'd be able to utilize that in terms of the existing dispensaries where most cannabis medical sales are being done? Just if you could expand upon how you might be able to participate in the U.S. in the event of rescheduling on the medical side? Thank you.\nIrwin Simon: Listen, I think as I've said, and I said in my comments, what rescheduling does and medical cannabis legalized, a couple things. I think, it brings in some additional shareholders in regards to institutional shareholders. It changes the way in regards to some of the banking reform, I think, possibly. But more important, medical cannabis now, which is legal in about 10 states, medical cannabis is, I think the opportunity to sell medical cannabis in the U.S. nationally, where today, we are the largest in Europe and we have a big business in Canada. So, taking our infrastructure and hopefully we could import products from the Canadian market or ultimately would we buy something in in the U.S. that would allow us to get into the medical business. But again, we have the expertise, we have the research, we work with the doctors, we work with the doctors on writing prescriptions today, we work with multiple hospitals, as you heard us talk about doing research on brain cancers and some other sleep apnea and some other diseases out there, anxiety. I mean, we've been doing this now for the last five, six years. So, taking that knowledge, taking that research and taking the expertise and we may have to move some of our people here and set up the infrastructure to do it, but it would not be a big issue for us to do it to get into the medical business in a big way in the U.S.\nAaron Grey: Okay, great. Thanks so much for the color. I'll jump back in the queue.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will be from the line of Tamy Chen with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTamy Chen: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask if you can talk a bit about how you view your current liquidity position. I think you're targeting for this fiscal year to be positive adjusted free cash flow. But that would suggest there's still be other cash outlays that you exclude from this, but it would be a burden on your cash balance. And you've highlighted a number of various innovation investments in, for example, your beverage alcohol segments. So, I'm just wondering how, at this point, you view your liquidity position. Thanks.\nIrwin Simon: I view we're in a pretty good shape. At the end of the quarter, we had close to $260 million of cash. Our debt, bank debt and our subordinate debt is basically little less than $500 million and we're working off the '24. So, I view us as generating cash, investing back in our businesses. And you got to remember this here, Tamy, as we go into the back half and get more and more cost savings out of this business and generating more and more cash in our alcohol spirits business, our international business, it helps us to reinvest back in our business. So, I come back and see us being in a pretty good place.\nTamy Chen: Okay. Thank you.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nOwen Bennett: Good morning, gents. Hope all well. Just a quick one on the international business. So, you mentioned or spoke about certain drivers into the back half, and you didn't really talk about the international business. So, I was hoping you could just touch a bit more on the expansion into new international markets you call out in the quarter. And then, assuming the new legislation gets passed in Germany, when can we expect to see a meaningful pickup in terms of number of patients in that market and can we assume that will also support in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nIrwin Simon: Owen, thank you for that. I think it's important as we've talked about rescheduling in the U.S. and what our international business has done because it's all medical cannabis and our growth cannabis is -- was over 50% in internationally without, of course, any acquisitions. And the team has done a great job. I'm going to let Denise talk about that in one second. But we have spent some time in Germany meeting with the German government, and we expect some things from that. So, Denise?\nDenise Faltischek: Thanks, Irwin, and hi, Owen. To answer your first question in terms of the back half, so we have a strategy that looks at how do we grow our existing markets and major markets for us today, as we've talked about our Germany, Poland and Luxembourg, and then also how do we continue to grow the ones that were -- that are emerging and we're entering in. We consider those along the lines of the UK, Portugal, Italy, Czech Republic. We are monitoring, of course, all the new regulations that are being discussed, whether Ukraine legalizes and also looking at Switzerland in terms of the medical market. We continue to basically roll out what we consider our go-to-market strategy, which is try to be the first mover, get that early advantage. We find that doctors utilize the worldwide knowledge that we have on medical cannabis. And so, as we go into new countries, our reputation in medical cannabis where we've been looked at as an expert by both medical professionals as well as government and healthcare professionals, we go in, we provide education symposiums and really work to bring the reputation and knowledge of Tilray into each of those markets. Answering your second question in terms of the legislation that's coming on board, we note that in -- sometime in January, the legislation is going to be in front of the German parliament again. Early February, it will be in front of the state parliamentary system for their review. And we are hoping to see that legislation passed in Q1 of this year, 2024. And then, shortly after that, we expect to see the rollout of decriminalization and social clubs, as well as the scheduling of medical cannabis as narcotic. We'll see doctors come on board. We are obviously increasing our educational efforts to bring more and more health professionals on board with medical cannabis as a therapeutic option. And we're really, really optimistic about the future in Germany.\nOwen Bennett: Great. Thanks, guys. Really helpful. Appreciate it.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Zamparo with CIBC. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Zamparo: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to get to the change in the agreement with Aphria Diamond. This sounds like a material win. So, just confirming the amounts, you now expect to save $30 million to $35 million typically paid to your JV partner and also $20-plus-million in cash taxes a year. So, $55 million a year annually, the increased value to Tilray. Just confirming that that's the change. And then, the question is how did this come about? And why did the JV partner agree to it? Did Tilray have to give up something to receive such a benefit? Thank you.\nCarl Merton: So, thanks, John. Good question. So, just -- I just want to be clear that because of the way the accounting works for the -- for Aphria Diamond, the number that you raised in terms of the $33 million to $35 million, that's going to change the allocation of net income or net loss in an individual quarter. It doesn't flow through the income statement. It won't create additional net income for the consolidated entity. It changes the allocation of that income between the JV partner and us. As it relates to the cash taxes, that obviously impacts our cash balance. And it also -- that part only will flow through our income statement. In terms of the negotiation, I think, when we looked at the agreement and when our partner looked at the agreement, they realized that the Canadian market had changed and we needed to modify the agreement. Obviously, there were give and takes associated with that agreement. But at the end of the day, we've been able to modify that and deliver that value to our shareholders.\nIrwin Simon: I think the most important thing is, we have a good partner in the [indiscernible] that have worked with us I think as we look at the long term of the industry. But the most important thing is when we went in there, price compression has hit this company close to $200 million over the last couple of years, and they were not sharing within the price compression. I think there is some important here that there was even though there was a time limit on this here but walking in there win-win for both and hopefully we can sell more cannabis. We've consolidated some additional cannabis into his -- into their facilities with the Tilray and some of the HEXO acquisitions and some of the other stuff we're doing. So, there was multiple parts of it that made sense. And I think part of that too was in doing that was benefit of some tax opportunities for us that was very, very helpful. So, it was a win-win situation.\nJohn Zamparo: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Bottomley: Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up with some of Irwin's comments with respect to when you're asked about further value proposition out of Canada, and specifically with respect to ultimate market share, at least in the medium term. I know on the back of the sort of Tilray Aphria combination, there was a hope of maybe getting as high as 30%. So, given the fact that you're 500 basis points ahead in terms of market share, who's number two? How much of sort of increased market share is things that are in your control, whether it's through innovative products versus just continuing to wait for this market shakeout, which seems to be taking longer than everyone had anticipated?\nIrwin Simon: Listen, great question. As I look at it and say, we have a 12.5%, 13% market share and I look at everybody else, there is about another 10% market share. And then I look at the other 800 LPs with 1%, 0.5%, there's a lot -- there's just a lot of growers out there. I think what we're seeing is either a lot of consolidation or a lot of small LPs going away. Originally, I'd come out there and said I wanted high double digits or in the 20%s or 25% market share. You got to remember, we're number one in Canada -- number one in Ontario, number one in Quebec, and number one in British Columbia, which represents 60% -- over 60% of the population. So, I think there's good opportunities to grow market share. But on the other hand, where I look at big opportunities is in the beverage category, the edibles category. I think there are some big opportunities in vaping going forward. And you heard what I said before, more and more consumers -- the market is growing in Canada. The problem is there's still way too many LPs, there's still high costs with exercise tax. And from a standpoint here, I think as we can got to grow in other categories and that's the big thing and how do we become that low-cost producer. The other big thing in the Canadian market which we have to focus on is building brands. And it's hard to build brands when the government doesn't allow you to advertise. So, how do we advertise within the marketplace and ultimately be within the guidelines of what Health Canada does. You heard what I said before, I think we have a great infrastructure and great leadership team in Canada. We now have a Belleville facility, which we acquired from Molson's that can do non-alcoholic drinks, that can do energy drinks, can do water drinks and can do other drinks. So with that, do we expand into other categories and other adjacencies to our cannabis business? But I'm looking for some conditional major growth coming from the beverage category, which I think, from a size standpoint, and I think there's still a big opportunity in vapes and edibles category in Canada.\nMatt Bottomley: Okay. Thanks for that.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the beverage alcohol segment and focus on the recently acquired brands. I know you gave some of the gross margin drivers of just how you've got line of sight on improvement there, but it sounds like you're really expecting to turn the top-line around as well. It looks like those are running down close to 10% or so. Can you just get us a little more confident that you've got some plans that can make that happen? And we've seen the U.S. consumer be pretty fickle sometimes in craft beer especially. So, what is it that would excite them and get these brands back to growth?\nIrwin Simon: Good question. I think, again, let's come back and look at our legacy brands of SweetWater, Montauk, Alpine, Nelson and Green Flash. You heard what I said, we grew 10% in our legacy beer businesses in the last quarter. So, we're growing our current legacy businesses, which is important. If you come back and look at the brands we acquired from ABI, there is some great brands in there. I mean, Shock Top, we talked to people about Shock Top, we talked to people some of the stuff in Blue Point here in the Northeast, Breckenridge Brewery, 10 Barrel. So, we really have some great brands that from a regional standpoint, that may be only sold in certain parts of the country and where do we expand. Our distributor base is excited about it. Our retail base is excited about it. Our convenience stores excited. So that's what makes me feel good as we've been out there making presentations and talking to our customer base right now. There's a lot of interest. The second thing is we have a pipeline of innovation that we have moved on very quickly. And these brands have not had innovation done with them in the last couple of years. So, I feel good about the innovation. I feel good about the distribution. I feel good about getting the distributors excited. And now as we bring this together and there's a real focus on it with a dedicated sales team, a dedicated national accounts team, we're putting pressures on our distributors. I feel we can really get the growth. The next thing is, as we bring these into our facilities and we look at some of the cost synergies, we can get our margins back to where our traditional margins are with our current brands. So, I'm real optimistic, and I come back and I say this here, yes, the beer industry has gone through some challenges in growth. I think -- and again, spending time with BCG and doing our studies here, I feel there is some great opportunities within the beer category. Now there has to be changes on alcohol. There has to be changes in regards to non-alcoholic. There's got to be some other changes in how do we get males and females in Gen Z drinking beer is a lot of the stuff that we're going to do. And we've talked about it. We're going to expand into some water business, energy drink business and some other categories. We're not going to be just the beer business. We will be the Tilray beverage business, I think which is important because we have manufacturing facilities, we have distribution out there and we have a sales and marketing infrastructure to drive this behind it. And I got to tell you, there's a tremendous amount of sporting venues. There's tremendous amount of universities that have reached out to us and want us a part of their sponsorship.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Frederico Gomes with ATB Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nFrederico Gomes: Hi, good morning. My question is...\nIrwin Simon: Good morning.\nFrederico Gomes: ...you mentioned key strategic acquisitions in your prepared remarks, something you look at. So, can you remind us how you look at acquisitions between your alcohol and your cannabis segments, and also geographically, whether you're focused on Canada, the West, or are you also looking at opportunities elsewhere? Thank you.\nIrwin Simon: So, I come back and look at strategic acquisitions, as I've said, we got a lot of growth, we got a lot of brands. We're into most categories in the Canadian market. And with that, if there was something strategic that could help our cost structure that would help us to take -- to be within our portfolio of brands, we would absolutely look at it. But you heard what I said before, one of the big things I'm looking at in Canada today, how do we diversify and be in other categories with adjacencies to the cannabis industry, and is that bev alcohol, is that drinks, et cetera. So that's what we're looking at in the Canadian market. In regards to the U.S. market, we're focused on bev alcohol here. We're focused on in regards to our Manitoba Harvest, is there food businesses with adjacencies that would make sense to be part of our Manitoba Harvest business, is something that we would look at. And then internationally, we like the bev alcohol business internationally. There is some stuff that we've looked at there. And how do we expand some of our medical business in our international market, and there's markets where we could do an acquisition or two. So, we're looking at strategic. They got to be accretive. They got to be good value there for us and how do we integrate it into our current infrastructure. If you come back and look with the Tilray-Aphria acquisition, we took out over $100 million of cost. With the HEXO business, we'll take out close to $35 million of cost. With Truss and our beverage business, we will take out additional costs there. If you come back and look at the ABI, SweetWater, Montauk, we will take a good amount of cost out of there. So, what got to be is businesses that fit within where we can take out costs. But the more important thing here is we need organic growth and ultimately use that infrastructure. And as a company today of our size, I mean, just being a public company cost out there today, it's higher costs for our insurance because we have cannabis within here. So again, how do we absorb some of those costs with putting more sales on, I think that's something that we look at here.\nFrederico Gomes: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobin Holby: Good morning. This is Robin Holby on for Vivien Azer, and thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the international question, specifically on Australia, where we've been seeing some strong patient growth. Any updates for your plans in that market? And do you see any of these international markets becoming saturated as more competitors achieve the necessary certifications? Thank you.\nDenise Faltischek: Yeah. No, thank you for the question. So, in terms of Australia, we see really great opportunity in Australia. We have a more of -- a leading business there in both Australia and New Zealand, both with our extracts as well as our flower. What we have done is we have expanded our portfolio of flower in order to take advantage of that market, including as of last quarter, we introduced Broken Coast into the market as the market really was looking for more of a proliferation around medical cannabis flower. And we will continue to evaluate that market for new form factors. In terms of your question about competition achieving more certifications, we have been in the market with GMP certification. Our GMP certification is actually above the standards that's actually required in Australia. And we find that healthcare professionals and government regulators enjoy the fact that we take the higher standard approach, considering that medical cannabis we think high standards as our key. And we will continue to grow that market and look for opportunities to partner with additional cannabis dispensaries, partnering with healthcare clinics, et cetera.\nRobin Holby: Got it. Thank you.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've come to the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll hand the floor to management for closing remarks.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you very much everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I sit here and proud of where we are. We are a global company. We are a diversified company. And if you look at public companies out there today, there's very few companies that emulate or resemble what we do in cannabis, alcohol, food and sell on a global basis. We're dealing in categories today that are new to the marketplace in regards to cannabis. We're dealing with categories today where there's a lot of regulatory requirements. And that's something that we do as a company to ensure when we produce cannabis, it goes through strict regulatory and quality control before we put any product out there. And that's the same with every single product. I come back and I remember joining Aphria when we were a $50 million business, today, on the run rate, to close to $1 billion. We had record net revenue of $194 million, and that is after excise tax comes off the top. We're a number one in the Canadian market. Like I said before, a tough market with a lot of LPs, still an illicit market there and still a market that's just five years old, where a lot more consumers are being educated and we're trying to build brands out there and not being able to advertise. So with that, we've accomplished a lot and we got a lot more to do. In Europe, again, we're the largest medical cannabis company in Europe with a 55% growth, which we see lots of opportunities in different countries. We see lots of change coming in Germany. And with that spending a lot of time over there and having a grow facility in Portugal and Germany gives us a leg up in a very good way. And I think the important thing is, there's a lot of sharing between the Canadian market medical business and the European market that we're doing that ultimately like I said before, if the scheduling never happened, what we could bring to the U.S. I'm really excited about our bev alcohol business. Our beer business being the fifth largest cannabis business. I remember when we first bought SweetWater, we were selling about 2 million cases plus beer a year. Now, we'll sell close to 12 million cases, have over 12 brands, six processing facilities, 12 brew houses, and brands that got tremendous opportunity. I see a big resurgence happening in the beer category in multiple ways. And I think that's something that we're going to help evolve and change with innovation, with distribution, with new products, with education about beer. And as I've said and try to coin this, how do you make beer cool again and not from just a drinking standpoint. From a standpoint of people, I really have to say I'm very lucky to get to work with a great organization, over 2,300 people around the world. We onboarded, over the last two months, over 700 new people with the acquisition of ABI. And with that, that went seamless and I very much want to welcome them as part of the Tilray family. I was asked a question about our balance sheet. That's something that Carl and I spend a lot of time on managing our balance sheet. Something that keeps me up at night is debt, so how do we deal with our debt, how do we generate cash? And again, we're five-year-old company that have done multiple acquisitions. We spent a lot of CapEx on growth CapEx. And how do we do that, and at the end of the day, manage our balance sheet? And last but not least, our shareholders. We're here for our shareholders. We're here to work for our shareholders. And we're here to deliver upon our shareholders who invest money in us. So, we've got lots to look forward to. The back half is a big back half for us. There's a lot of heavy lifting to do we know. But I'd tell you we have a good plan and a path to hopefully let us get there. So, thank you very much for listening to today's call and look forward to speaking to you in the near future. Happy New Year and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

Also joining us for the question-and-answer segment are Denise Faltischek, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of International; Blair MacNeil, President, Tilray Canada; and Ty Gilmore, President of U.S. Beer business. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tilray Brands' Chairman and CEO, Irwin Simon.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you, Berrin, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our quarterly call. At Tilray Brands, we strategically diversified our cannabis lifestyle and CPG company globally, and we've done so for several reasons, including the tremendous growth opportunities we see within the beverage category and across markets like craft beer, ready-to-drink cocktails, non-alcoholic beverages, energy, and nutritional drinks. These product categories and others in our portfolio further allow us to address the ever-changing cannabis market conditions, while driving market share in the industries in which we compete. This effort is backed by our portfolio of high-quality lifestyle brands and the strong and growing distribution networks that are behind them. Our goal is doing this is clear to accelerate our ability to deliver industry-leading profitable growth and sustainable long-term shareholder value. To this end, our achievements in fiscal 2024 to date and expectations for the balance of the year reflects the strides we're making by focusing on our core fundamentals: number one, maximizing profitable revenue growth through organic expansion initiatives and key strategic acquisition with strong synergy potential; number two, realizing the benefits of optimized asset utilization and cost management to ensure a lean efficient cost structure across all our business segments; and of course, number three, continuing to strengthen our industry-leading balance sheet and cash position. Our strategic execution and achievements affirm that we have emerged as the most diversified cannabis lifestyle and CPG company globally with four distinct and complimentary business segments. These consists of cannabis, broken out into medical and adult-use, along with beverages, including craft beer, spirits, ready-to-drink mixed cocktails, and non-alcoholic drinks and CBD beverages, wellness products, and a medical distribution business. As a result, we had a record Q1 with net revenue of $177 million, representing 15% growth year-over-year. We grew EBITDA in our cannabis business and our international businesses. We grew Canadian cannabis revenue by 16.5% in the quarter and remain the leading strongest and most profitable international cannabis LP with approximately a 13.4% share in Canada inclusive of HEXO and Truss, 631 basis points ahead of the next LP. From a product category perspective, we continue to lead cannabis sales in almost every market across Canada, the largest federally legal cannabis market in the world. Tilray is number one in cannabis flower, oils, concentrates, and THC beverages, and number two in pre-rolls, number four in vape, and the top 10 in all other categories. Aggregated all categories in either inhalables or ingestibles, Tilray is number one in both of these groups. We grew international cannabis revenue by 37%, and we are the market leader in medical cannabis across Europe with leading market shares in Germany, Poland, and Luxembourg. We are a leader in the hemp food industry with a 52% branded market share with Manitoba Harvest in the U.S. and Canadian market share of nearly 80%. With our recent acquisition of eight craft beer and beverage brands from Anheuser-Busch, we are growing fast in the craft beverage alcohol industry, solidifying our leadership position as the fifth largest U.S. craft beer brewer with 5% market share in a growing market. And since year-end, we paid down a $177 million of our debt. The balance we have brought to our business model by going beyond cannabis has given us a strong position today and is positioning us well for higher growth future opportunities, including when U.S. federal cannabis legalization and German legalization of adult-use cannabis happens. We believe we're in a great place going forward, well positioned with the resources, infrastructure, and operations, the distribution of brands, sales and marketing and know-how to lead the revolution of cannabis CPG into the American and European mainstream. Let us now discuss our individual segments with the context of our overall business. Cannabis was our largest segment by net revenue and comprised of approximately 40% of the total revenue. Gross revenue from Canadian adult-use cannabis increased 22%, driven by innovation and shared growth in dried flower, vapes and pre-roll. This was achieved both organically and as a result of our recent acquisitions, and despite price compression in the quarter of approximately $3 million from the prior year quarter. Notably in Q1, according to combine HyFire and Weed Crawler retail sales data, Tilray sold over double the units of the number two and number three LPs combined. In equivalent KGs, we sold double the amount of the number two LP. As pre-rolls continue to grow, we shipped over 18 million pre-rolls, 200,000 per day, that is a lot of pre-rolls. In terms of market share in our core business of Tilray, when we exclude HEXO and Truss, we finished Q1 with 8.76% market share, which is up versus Q4 2023 and year-over-year versus fiscal year 2023 Q1 by 57 basis points and 38 basis points, respectively. We maintained our number one market share position and expanded the gap by an additional 20 basis points to an overall gap of a 136 basis points versus the number two LP by market share. Our combined market share for Q1 when including Tilray, HEXO and Truss was 13.4%. Regionally, we grew our share at all four major markets in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, furthering our best-in-class market coverage to a highly-fragmented retail network. Finally, we continue to have a relentless focus on synergies. We reported planned synergies up $27 million with the HEXO transaction in just two months We have had already achieved $17.1 million of the target through elimination of duplicate costs, streamlining SG&A and renegotiating key contracts. In Q2, we will complete the integration of HEXO from an operational standpoint, which includes centralizing our packaging and logistics into our Aphria One facility, driving further efficiencies. With regard to our Masson facility in Quebec, we've invested in making the necessary changes to convert and optimize the facility to grow cannabis and fruits and vegetables for the Quebec marketplace. This work is on track and we will begin planting cucumbers this year. On a related acquisition note, in August, we purchased the remaining 57.5% equity ownership of Truss Beverage Company from Molson Canada. The transaction further strengthens our number one cannabis market share position in Canada with a combined market share of approximately 40% in the THC beverage and positions us at the forefront of the adult-use beverage sector. Our expanded cannabis portfolio now includes the fastest-growing beverage brands, including XMG, Mollo, House of Terpenes, and Little Victory. We believe that THC beverages present a significant opportunity. There are nearly 11 million customers in Canada for cannabis beverages and the category is already roughly C$100 million at retail. In addition to the category opportunity, transitioning THC beverage production to our London facility will generate further cost savings and synergies. Turning to international cannabis, which achieved revenue growth and approved profitability in Q1, our intentions are twofold: strengthening our leadership position and market share in the medical cannabis category, where we currently operate across 21 countries; and achieving early mover advantage in new countries as medical legalization advances. Based on these trends to date, we are building momentum in Poland, Italy, the UK and the Czech Republic. As we look to fiscal 2024 for international cannabis business, our focus is on: high-quality medical cannabis brands, which are trusted by patients, healthcare professionals, and government officials around the world; our best-in-class cultivation facilities in Portugal and Germany, where we are one of only three companies in Germany that can cultivate in-country, as well as leveraging our Canadian cannabis facilities and expertise; our medical distribution network, led by our integrated Tilray Pharma and medical cannabis teams, with relationships across 13,000 pharmacies. From a bottom-line perspective, we are laser focused on optimizing our European platform, working to remove approximately $8 million of costs from our businesses, of which we've already competed over $6.8 million. CC Pharma, which we are rebranding to Tilray Pharma, is our established medical distribution platform for traditional branded and generic pharmaceuticals as well as medical cannabis. This business segment from a revenue perspective is currently equal in size to our cannabis segment, comprising slightly less than 40% of the total sales mix. It grew 14% in Q1 from a year ago and expanded its gross profit margin due to a reduction in production costs and an improving product mix. Similar to the U.S., we are not planning our business around adult-use legalization in Germany. However, there is proposed legislation in Germany for medical cannabis to be declassified as a narcotic. And if the proposed German legislation comes to pass, it may be prescribed as a medicine rather than a narcotic, which is more difficult for healthcare providers to prescribe. This in turn would open accessibility to a larger patient population. Now turning to our beverage alcohol and CBG portfolio, a high-quality growing portfolio of lifestyle craft beverage alcohol and wellness brands that have enabled us to build a strong footprint in the U.S. market without engaging in business that touches a cannabis plant. Importantly, beverages are a fast-growing category with significant growth through innovation and M&A and high future growth and healthy margins. Within beverages, for example, the craft beer business is expected to grow to $282 billion globally by 2032, a CAGR of 10.5% between 2023 and 2032. With North America accounting for 40% of the revenue today of that $40 billion in 2023. Given that, it is a market we have been following closely in order to seize on the clear opportunity that exists today. Reflecting that earlier this week, we welcomed the newest additions to the Tilray Brands family as we closed on our acquisition of eight beer and beverage brands from Anheuser-Busch. These brands, Shock Top, Breckenridge Brewery, Blue Point Brewing Company, 10 Barrel Brewing Company, Redhook Brewery, Widmer Brothers Brewing, Square Mile Cider Company, and HiBall Energy, have enabled us to further diversify and expand our beverage alcohol segment while elevating our position within craft beer from number nine to projected number five. We are confident that as we layer on our team's deep experience and skills in product innovation and marketing, we will be able not only grow our brands, but also evolve the overall craft beer category, where there is clear and strong opportunity to grow the consumer demographics and expand into new products and formats, such as [RTD] (ph) and new channels. Taken together, over the last three years, we've added a total of 13 brands to our beverage alcohol portfolio. The eight that I just referred to, in addition to SweetWater Brewing Company in December of 2020, Alpine Beer and Green Flash Brewing Company in January of 2022, and Montauk Brewing Company in November of 2022, we also own Breckenridge Distillery, the award-winning spirits brand and the world's best blended whiskey, which was acquired in December 2021. In terms of overall segment performance, quarterly revenue for the beverage alcohol business was $24.2 million in Q1, representing a 17% growth from last year, and we're just getting started in making this segment a more meaningful component of our financials. We project pro forma revenue for our beverage alcohol segment, including these recently acquired brands, of about $300 million. Finally, our wellness segment is delivering higher gross profit on a stable of top-line as it's adjusted to higher ingredient costs through increased pricing from a year ago. It remains an important element of our U.S. strategy because of these factors. Strong consumer interest in hemp products, expanded distribution into Whole Foods and Walmart and product innovation to meet needs of the Gen Z/millennial consumer through new hemp [forward] (ph) foods and supplement offerings in CBD wellness beverage like our Happy Flower. It's also worth noting that Manitoba Harvest is the industry leader in terms of sustainability, having recertified as a B Corp for the 10th consecutive year and having launched the first Regenerative Organic Certified Hemp Hearts SKU this past spring. Across the board, we are delivering solid performance by optimizing our U.S. businesses and setting the stage for significant growth in the near- and longer-term future for existing and newly acquired brands. In summary, we think the opportunities afforded by our intentional business diversifications are numerous and exciting as we look ahead. Our go-forward plan is to execute on what matters most, maximizing revenue and growth, optimizing efficiency, and maintaining our balance sheet strength as we invest in our industry-leading brands. I will now turn the call over to Carl to discuss the financials in greater detail.\nCarl Merton: Thank you, Irwin. Before reviewing our quarterly performance, let me remind everyone that our financial results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars, and we will reference both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results throughout our discussion. In addition, our earnings press release contains a reconciliation of our reported results under GAAP to the non-GAAP measures identified during our remarks. Q1 total net revenue rose to $177 million compared to the prior-year quarter at $153 million, representing 15% growth. In constant currency, net revenue similarly grew 15% based upon constant currency revenue of $176 million in Q1 this year. By segment, cannabis net revenue rose 20% or 22% on a constant currency basis, inclusive of $3.1 million due to price compression in Canada, of which virtually all also represented a reduction in EBITDA. Distribution revenue rose 14% or 11% on a constant currency basis. Beverage alcohol revenue rose 17%, and wellness revenue declined 1%, but was flat on a constant currency basis. Cannabis excise taxes, which are a reduction from revenue, totaled $26.6 million compared to $17.1 million last year. This reflected a sharp increase in cannabis revenue generated in Canada versus the year-ago period due in part to the HEXO acquisition which closed during Q1 offset by continued price compression in the market. Recall that excise tax is predominantly computed as a fixed price on grams sold rather than as a percentage of the selling price. While there is an excise task force to present these challenges to the Minister of Finance in Canada, we do not believe some level of reform is likely in the near term. As Irwin already emphasized the inherent benefits of having a diversified business model, it is notable that in both Q1 this year and last year, our cannabis and distribution segment each represented about 40% of our total revenue mix, while beverage alcohol and wellness represented about 14% and 8%, respectively. These percentages will change with a full quarter of contributions from the HEXO and Truss acquisitions, along with the addition of the acquired brands from Anheuser-Busch. We believe we will achieve a balance of 30% cannabis, 30% distribution, 30% beverage alcohol, and the final 10% wellness. But the key takeaway here is that we have achieved great balance and are not overly dependent on any one segment from a top-line or even gross profit standpoint. In terms of our geographical footprint, we are also highly diversified with slightly more than half of our revenue from North America and about 45% from EMEA, with the remainder from other parts of the world. Gross profit was $44.2 compared to $48.6 million in the prior-year quarter, while gross margin decreased to 25% from 32% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted gross profit, inclusive of purchase price accounting step-up, was nearly flat at $49.3 million compared to $49.7 million in the prior-year quarter, while adjusted gross margin was 28% compared to 32%. I will discuss adjusted gross margin by individual segment in a moment, but it improved across three of our four segments with the exception being cannabis that was primarily due to the prior quarter having 100% gross margin on the HEXO advisory fee revenue. Net loss improved to $55.9 million compared to $65.8 million in the prior-year quarter. On a per share basis, this amounted to a net loss of $0.10 versus $0.13 in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.4 million, down from $13.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The primary variance relates to the HEXO advisory fee revenue in the prior-year quarter that was not duplicated this quarter as we owned HEXO for the majority of the quarter. Other contributing factors include the timing difference in recognizing synergies from operating results after completing acquisitions. Recall that when we reported Q4 2022 during the summer of 2022, we announced a $30 million cost optimization plan. Through August 31st of this year, we've achieved $22 million on an annualized run rate basis, of which $21 million represents actual cost savings through Q1. This is up from $18.5 million when we reported last quarter. Operating cash flow improved by $30.5 million to a loss of $15.8 million from a loss of $46.3 million in the prior-year quarter. This was the result of improved operating efficiencies realized through our synergy programs and management of our working capital requirements. Turning now to our business segments. Gross cannabis revenue of $96.9 million was comprised of $71.2 million in Canadian adult-use revenue, $14.3 million in international cannabis revenue, $6.1 million in Canadian medical cannabis revenue, and $5.3 million in wholesale cannabis revenue. Net cannabis revenue was $70.3 million, representing a 20% increase from the year-ago period, or 22% in constant currency. The positive variance was mostly related to increased organic growth and the acquisitions of HEXO and Truss. Canadian medical cannabis decreased slightly due to increased competition from the adult-use market and price compression in the medical cannabis market. Adult-use cannabis increased 22% due to organic growth from our existing brands launching new products as well as the increased revenue from the acquisition of HEXO and Truss. Offsetting the increase in the current period was a substantial reduction of advisory services revenue from the prior-year quarter to do the HEXO acquisition, which terminated the previous strategic arrangement that was in place. The substantial increase in wholesale cannabis revenue was an opportunistic sale, which helped increase our cash flow from operations, even though it had a negative impact on gross margin and EBITDA. International cannabis grew 37%, largely because of the expansion into emerging international medical markets. Cannabis gross profit was $19.8 million, and cannabis gross margin was 28%, compared to $29.7 million and 51% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted cannabis gross profit, which removes the purchase price accounting step-up decreased to $24.3 million from $29.7 million in the prior-year quarter, while adjusted gross cannabis margin decreased to 35% from 51% in the prior-year quarter. However, if we are to exclude advisory services revenue from HEXO of $1.5 million in Q1 2024 and $7.8 million in Q1 2023 and the wholesale transaction with a negative growth profit of $2.7 million in the quarter, our adjusted cannabis gross margin would have been 39% compared to 43%. The remaining decrease is a result of price compression. Distribution revenue, derived predominantly through CC Pharma, increased 14% to $69.2 million from $60.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by increased capacity and a revamped sales approach to expand our distribution network of procured products and was aided partially by the strengthening of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Distribution gross profit increased to $7.7 million compared to $5.6 million, while distribution gross margin increased to 11% from 9% in the prior-year quarter. Similar to the last three fiscal quarters, the year-over-year increase was a result of a positive change in product mix focused on higher margin sales, including the decision to exit the medical device reprocessing line. Beverage alcohol revenue was $24.2 million, up 17% from $20.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The positive delta was due to contributions from our Montauk brewery acquisition last November. Beverage alcohol gross profit increased to $12.9 million compared to $9.8 million, while beverage alcohol gross margin increased to 53% from 47% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted beverage alcohol gross profit, which removes the purchase price accounting step-up, was $13.5 million compared to $10.9 million in the prior-year quarter, while adjusted gross margin rose to 56% from 53% in the prior-year quarter. This increase was related to a favorable sales mix change between beer and spirits, partially offset by the impact of the Montauk acquisition that was not completed in the prior-year period. Wellness segment revenue held at $13.3 million compared to $13.4 million in the prior-year quarter, despite increasing pricing to combat ingredient cost inflation. Wellness gross profit was $3.8 million up from $3.5 million in the prior-year quarter and gross margin rose to 29% from 26%, as we countered the impacts of higher input costs of seed ingredients with higher pricing. Our cash and marketable securities balance as of August 31st was $464.9 million, down from $490.6 million in the year-ago period, but increased from the balance at year-end of $448.5 million. During Q1, we entered into a new $120 million credit agreement led by Bank of America and included syndicate members, City National Bank, TD Bank, and Pinnacle Financial, for our beverage alcohol division, which is comprised of domestic-owned subsidiaries and provides for, among other things, a $70 million term loan facility, a $20 million delayed draw term loan facility, which we drew in full as part of the payment of the purchase price on the acquisition of the Anheuser-Busch brands, and a $30 million line of credit, of which we have only drawn $7 million. The new credit agreement extended the maturity date on the loan from December 2023 out to June 2028 with reduced repayment requirements, improved financial covenants, all while maintaining the interest rate spread on the loans. On August 31, we settled our obligations under a $50 million convertible promissory note, which had a maturity date of September 1. And finally, subsequent to quarter-end, we settled and paid in full our Tilray '23 Convertible Note. Let's now reiterate our guidance for fiscal 2024, which ends on May 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is still projected at $68 million to $78 million. Note that we are not increasing this range after having acquired the beverage brands. They will be accretive to EBITDA as we said when we first announced the transaction, but will not have a material impact on EBITDA in the first year post closing. We also project positive adjusted free cash flow from operations, excluding our cost to integrate HEXO, Truss and the brands from Anheuser-Busch and the cash income taxes we pay at Aphria Diamond. We will also work to minimize CapEx and improve our industry-leading balance sheet. With that, I will conclude our prepared remarks and open the lines for questions from our covering analysts. Operator, what's the first question?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobin Holby: Good morning. This is Robin Holby on for Vivien Azer, and thank you for taking the question. First off, congratulations on closing...\nIrwin Simon: Good morning.\nRobin Holby: Yeah, good morning. Congratulations on closing the acquisition of the ABI beverage brands. Today, you called out the margin accretion from the Montauk acquisition to your overall beverage margins. Could you please speak to how you see margins for that segment evolving over time, in particular that you're not only acquiring craft beer brands but also on-premise infrastructure? Thank you.\nCarl Merton: So, the increase in gross margin in beverage alcohol this quarter was a combination of 2 things. One, it was a minor shift in sales mix or in product mix between beer and spirits, and also as a result of the acquisition of Montauk. Going forward, we are very confident that the beer brands themselves will be able to maintain a margin above 50%, but our spirits business traditionally has been closer to 50%. So, as that blend gets mixed in with the new brands we've acquired, we'll start to see it move a little closer to the beer margin.\nIrwin Simon: And I know one of Vivien's favorite questions is -- regards our brew houses. We sell more beer in our brew houses than food. And I think that's what the important thing is of how food does not dilute our margins in our brew houses. And that's what our brew houses are about, is to go out there in market and sell more and more beer. And that's very much what our plans are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes in line of Andrew Carter with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Carter: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Okay. So, I want to just go back to the [short] (ph) report that was out last month and just use this opportunity to clear the air. First off, regarding Double Diamond, could you help us fully understand the liability? What is the required annual payment to your partners? Is it variable based on performance? Do you have the ability to throttle their production, therefore adjust to market demands? And then, the second question, do you pay some proportion of your minor shareholder in stock? And if so, are these stocks added back to EBITDA? Thanks.\nCarl Merton: Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate the opportunity to just make sure that everyone is crystal clear on this transaction. What I want to start off with first is that we have never paid for an actual operating expense at Aphria Diamond out of the dividends that we've issued. The dividends that we have issued to our partners in Aphria Diamond has always been a payment of profit distribution at the -- there's a couple -- sorry, there's a quarterly payment that happens and then there's a [true-up] (ph) at the end of the year. And that is the only amount that we have ever paid through those dividends. At one point during the year last year, we did provide some downside protection. And when that payment was triggered, that payment went through the income statement and that was added back to EBITDA. That is the only piece of those dividend parts that has ever flown through the income statement and it was an extremely small amount and it was fully disclosed in our financial statements.\nIrwin Simon: I think, Andrew, what's important is that our partner in Diamond will take equity and if he keeps it, it's his prerogative. If he sells it, it's his prerogative. But again, there's a distribution of dividends at the same time. There's profits where we have 50% -- 51%, and we're enjoying the profits of that too. So I think that's what's important. But to Carl's point, those -- the stock is not used to pay for operations of the business. I think that's what's important.\nAndrew Carter: Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nAaron Grey: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the question. So, just regarding the EBITDA and EBITDA guidance, you guys held it now despite the beer brands acquisitions, it will be accretive. But if we just look at the quarter, excluding the small HEXO advisory fee, so call it about $10 million or so. So, can you walk us through how we think of this step-up to get to that $68 million to $70 million for the fiscal year? And maybe you can talk about the drivers and how we should think about the sequencing of the EBITDA step-up to reach that guidance? I think it'd be very helpful in any puts and takes. Or I think that could be more through top-line generation for more margin improvement via cost efficiencies or otherwise, I think that'd be appreciated. Thank you.\nCarl Merton: Thanks, Aaron. That question kind of reminds me of some of the questions we had last year when people asked the same questions on phasing when we ultimately did get to the EBITDA guidance number. We traditionally have stronger performance in our spirits brand in Q2 every year. That's because it's the buy-in for the Christmas holiday season that happens and so we see strengthening in that quarter in that business. And then as we as we evolve through the year, we have a significant outperformance in Q4 traditionally in our distribution business, as people -- as pharmacies buy-in for their customers going on vacation in the summer in our distribution business. And then, we see significant buy-in on our beer business in the fourth quarter in the lead up to summer. Overlaying that this year is the synergies that we're achieving at HEXO -- sorry on the HEXO transaction and our other open cost saving plans that we've had throughout the year. And so we're going to see a bigger jump in EBITDA next quarter, in Q2, you may see Q3 flat to down a little bit versus Q2, and then, you'll see a bigger Q4.\nIrwin Simon: I think the big drivers here is top-line. And you saw our top-line in our first quarter, and you heard me mention, we sold 20 million pre-rolls. Our beer business, both SweetWater and Montauk, were up. And that is the big thing, is getting the new distribution, but getting the new products out there. Ty and team launched a product called Gummies, which is a new product for us. And it was a big percentage of our growth of new products. Getting Montauk into other states, whether it's New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia, is going to be a big part of our growth. In our international business, growing our medical business in Poland, Germany, Italy and places like that is going to be a big part of our business. And the big thing you got to remember, which I talked about, we did three acquisitions. And we're looking to take $27 million of cost out of HEXO. We're going to be looking to take tremendous amount of costs out of the ABI and it's going to take time. And with the acquisition of Truss that we bought from Molson's, we'll be moving those products to our London facility and we have an excellent facility in Belleville, Ontario that we're going to look to do non-alcoholic drinks and energy drinks, some other types of drinks there. So, we're looking for a big year on organic growth in new products, innovation, new distribution. We're focused on taking more and more costs out of the business. In regards to our facility in Masson, you heard me talk about that, where we're converting that to vegetables, and that should be online by the end of the year and taking tremendous amount of costs. So, the drivers here are going to be top-line growth, taking costs out, which ultimately improve margins and drives profitability to the bottom-line.\nAaron Grey: Okay, great. Thanks very much for the call. I'll drop back into the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Bottomley: Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to first touch base on kind of that first strategic priority. Irwin, you were just sort of talking about it now with respect to some of the organic growth. But on the M&A front, what is the current landscape if we're looking at the cannabis sector in general and federal illegal environments with respect to what we're seeing in Canada and international markets? Is this something that you think probably has the least amount of opportunistic assets out there just given some of the headwinds we've seen in federal markets? And should we expect maybe more beverage alcohol focus when it comes to M&A allocation? I'm just curious if you have an indication one way or the other.\nIrwin Simon: So, I'm going to bring two other people in to talk about that. I have Blair MacNeil here who runs Canada. And I got to tell you I spent some time with Blair and team in Toronto and spent some time with other control boards. It's five years since cannabis is now legal in Canada. And what we're seeing is tremendous amount of consumers moving over to the legal market, tremendous amount of consumers partaking in the recreational. You heard us say we sold 20 million pre-rolls. And where that is going? We expect to sell 80 million pre-rolls a year. You see lots of consolidation at retail, much more awareness out there. Listen, there's still lots of problems in the Canadian market, but I got to tell you for the first time, I'm starting to feel really optimistic about the opportunities there. Blair, you want to add anything to it?\nBlair MacNeil: Yeah. So, to your question, Matt, on the opportunity on the M&A side, from an asset standpoint, I think if you look at our portfolio, we're very well-rounded. I'd say maybe we've got a small gap on the edible side, but when you look at the rest of our portfolio, we are very well represented. So, there's not a lot of assets out there that we would look to acquire over the next period of time. We do have -- as Irwin alluded to, all of our facilities are starting to really get up there in utilization and we have availability of some capacity to be able to bring edibles into that. So we'll look to do that over this next period of time. So, at least from a Canadian perspective, I'm happy with the growth we're seeing in the market. I'm happy with where the industry is, not without its challenges, as Irwin said, but from an M&A standpoint, we don't see a lot of opportunity there.\nIrwin Simon: Before I pass it to Denise about Europe, we're real excited about the beverage category. If you come back and think one of the biggest opportunities and you walk into cannabis stores today, there's a small fridge in there with drinks at $7, $8. But think about how the beverage category within the world today, you look at the craft beer category, $280 billion, and you come back and think this is a whole new category and the opportunities there. We have two facilities. We're the leader in the beverage business, and everybody wants to figure out what's the right way to roll this out and merchandise it. And my hope one day that you would be able to go into a beer store, a convenience store, or go into a bar, and it would be on tap. So that to us is one of the biggest opportunities. Internationally, medical has tremendous opportunities. Denise?\nDenise Faltischek: Thanks, Irwin. Yeah, so internationally, if you look at Europe first, really the only cannabis market today is a medical cannabis market. And Germany still remains the largest market within Europe. However, we do see some countries that are coming online and developing very quickly. The regulations are still -- as we all know, are still really shaping out. We are looking to see medical cannabis in Germany become de-scheduled as a narcotic and become a regular medicine that can be prescribed. And so, if we look at our business, we really see like our business is very nascent today and is still developing. And so, we are evaluating where do we have gaps in capabilities and where can potentially M&A fill in those gaps. And so, we are very much looking to see what is out there, what can we do to make our business have full capabilities, whether it's technology, whether it's online platforms, et cetera. And we are looking at the same thing in Australia and New Zealand, whether it's looking at clinics, et cetera. And then, also talking about potentially looking at how beverage alcohol might play a role in Europe as well. So, we are very much focused in seeing what might be available to round out our capabilities and make a more fulsome business.\nIrwin Simon: And to round out the third part of your question in regards to beverage alcohol, listen, we own some great brands today. And Ty and I are on the road to start visiting them after today and how we start integrating them and where we will be looking to sell them in each state and each tri-state, we will figure that out. But if you come back and look what the team has done with Montauk in a short period of time and growing that 9% and seeing SweetWater growing 4%, we're excited about Blue Point, we're excited about Breckenridge Brewery, we're excited about 10 Barrel and the rest that come along with this. So -- also, there's a lot of good things happening, and with Breckenridge Distillery, as this ultimately gets together with Breckenridge Brewery, as we continue to leap on the bourbon craze and get new and new distribution. And let's not forget our Manitoba Harvest business where we have about a 52% share in a category that's developing a lot of new products and we're getting a lot of new distribution. And I think the big thing is there, I mean we're in supermarkets, we're in Costcos, we're in the Walmarts. So we have avenues if we decide to bring other products in and we're selling our beer products in those today. So, we have an avenue of retail if we bring other wellness foods in there to make sure we -- they're accompanied by.\nMatt Bottomley: Got it. Appreciate all that color and it was a long response. I'll just get back into queue.\nIrwin Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frederico Gomes with ATB Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nFrederico Gomes: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just on your capacity utilization, I know that you addressed this a little bit, but maybe could you provide a bit more color on where you currently stand in terms of utilization in your cultivation and manufacturing facilities in Canada? And with your organic growth initiatives, where do you see that utilization and being over the reminder of the fiscal year and sort of the potential benefit that you could see in your margins as a result of that? Thank you.\nCarl Merton: Thanks for the question. Yeah, from a capacity and utilization, it's probably easiest for me to go across the facilities really quickly. But if you look at Masson, we're in the middle of the conversion of B9, which is 80% of that facility to vegetables, and that's on track to be fully utilized by January. And then, the remaining 20% will service the Quebec market with locally grown cannabis for Quebec. So, we're 100% utilized in Masson. At the Redecan facility, we'll be 100% utilized. We have an outdoor grow in Cayuga, which is currently at 50% utilized, but our plan is to grow that through pre-rolls to be up to 100% utilized by the end of the year. And that'll be very close to the end of the year, because May is when we plant the outdoor grow. And then, from a Leamington standpoint, we'll be 100% utilized in Aphria Diamond, and we do have some opportunities that will currently fill up our Aphria One facility by the end of the year. And then, Broken Coast has always been fully utilized. So, we feel very good about capacity and utilization overall. I definitely think that will help the margins on the balance of the year. I don't have a crystal ball on that front, but certainly as Irwin talked about, as we move all of our packaging from the acquisitions into Leamington, we're going to see great synergies on that side. The London facility on beverages will be close to 90% utilized with the transition of Truss. So, definitely, we're going to be able to allocate the overhead of those facilities across more volume throughout the end of the year.\nIrwin Simon: And I think not only utilization, we're vertically integrated here. So, we can grow flour, we can oil, we can -- we're probably the largest pre-roll producer today in the Canadian market. We're the largest producer of canned. We can produce any type of edible. So, with that, and what we're doing basically today is producing for ourselves, we are doing some wholesale. So, not only are we -- from the utilization standpoint, we're vertically integrated to support our 12 brands out there. And the big thing here is new product development. And that's what we've realized is in the Canadian market, consumers are looking for new products all the time. And whether the potency of the product, its infused products, the genetics of the product, the big thing what we have to work on is how we develop brands and get consumers used to buying brands. And that's one of the big opportunities and that's one of the things we need to work on.\nFrederico Gomes: Thank you very much. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the eight new brands that you've just closed and purchased. And at least on the retail side, where we can see some data, those have been declining for the last two or so years. I guess maybe first is that the full picture, is there a more holistic view that that's got better momentum, but either way then what does it really take to get that to -- you've said how important organic growth is, obviously it's not already in hand, so what does it take to really get those going? And how much more spending? Is there distribution upside? They've all been around for quite some time. How do you just think about driving growth there?\nIrwin Simon: I'm going to turn it over to Ty in a second. What goes down got ultimately go up, right? So I think that's what's important here. And yeah, they're declining and that's what gave us the opportunity. I think from some standpoint, did they get the attention that was needed? And I think it goes back and shows what we've done with SweetWater and what was done with Montauk, what's done with Green Flash and Nelson. And the team knows how to do it. Ty, you want to add something to that?\nTy Gilmore: Yeah. Michael, I'd say, I'm not real sure you're seeing the full picture. When you look at it at a total brand level, when you dive a little bit deeper and you get into the SKU level, we're really, really excited. You see brands like 10 Barrel, their pub beer, which is growing. You see Avalanche growing share in Colorado. You see what the Big Ballard part of the Redhook family and their SKUs and how they're getting into new segments is really, really exciting. So, yeah, I'm not real sure you're seeing the full picture. We've built out a really national account team. And as you know, chains play an integral part in building distribution and building brands. And we've had some really good conversations with big retailers around the U.S., and they're excited about the brands. Our distributors are extremely excited about us coming over and bringing energy and investments in focus. And just like we've done with Montauk and SweetWater, we are going to build out a plan to drive quality distribution, build the brands and really lean in on the SKUs that are driving some of these brands, which are exciting.\nIrwin Simon: And I think the big thing is it's not these brands, but the whole craft beer industry and what we can do. And we're working with [BCG] (ph) on a whole overall strategy here on the brand, the positioning, who the consumers are of craft beer, where the non-alcohol, where, from an ingredient standpoint, nutritionals on a beer in regards to can versus bottle versus other types of packaging, what's sold in a brew pub, what's sold on premise, what's sold in convenience stores, which are the biggest sellers of craft beer. So, there's a lot we're studying right now. There's a lot we're doing in data and research and working with BCG to bring that together. But we're pretty excited about the opportunity in the craft beer business and we're pretty excited. Listen, we're -- even though they're declining, we're now the fifth largest craft brewer. And I think the evolution of big beer versus craft beer is changing dramatically too.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, thanks for that. And can I just follow up on the cucumber farming? Not a sort of a piece of the portfolio I had anticipated maybe initially. Can you just help us understand maybe why that's interesting to you? And what the margins and growth might look like for that?\nIrwin Simon: Number one, listen, we got $1.5 million facility, if we went to sell it today what the values and that you're getting for in cannabis facilities. We think and we've been asked by multiple retailers in Quebec. There's a major shortage and they want vegetables grown in Quebec. There is better margin there than just keeping the place dark or selling cannabis that you can sell. And we'll see what happens. Ultimately, maybe one day we could sell it as a vegetable farm to someone else that wants it. But right now, with minimal investment, that facility has probably a couple hundred million dollars investment in it. And there is big demand for fruits, vegetables, and that in the Quebec market. The other thing is what we're going to do there is grow cannabis just for the Quebec market where they want cannabis grown in their province for their retailers.\nMichael Lavery: Okay.\nIrwin Simon: It is a profitable business. So that's -- I want to be very clear on that.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Bill Kirk with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Kirk: Hey, thank you for taking the questions. Irwin, you mentioned expanded distribution at Whole Foods in your prepared remarks. And given your incredibly strong history with them, could you maybe talk about how your background helps with this particular account? And I guess what does your experience tell you about the trajectory of brands into other retailers once you find success at Whole Foods?\nIrwin Simon: Back in the day -- it's interesting, and it's a great question, because other retailers used to go to Whole Foods and see what was new, what was natural, what was organic, and what was selling, because everybody wanted Whole Foods customers. I think that's changed quite a bit today. But again, Whole Foods is an important customer for us on our SweetWater, on our Montauk, on our Blue Point and some of our other products. Also a very important customer for us on Manitoba Harvest. And again, I think what Whole Foods is doing where they have their 365, but they want brands and that's what consumers are looking for. But I will tell you whether it's Kroger-Albertsons, H-E-B, they're important customers to us. And it's interesting what they're saying when we've introduced them to the new gummies product or Montauk pumpkin, what that is doing. So, what retailers are doing out there, yes, they're looking at what's selling in Whole Foods and is it a beer kombucha combined, et cetera, and some of the new innovation. But my experience before is retailers went to Whole Foods and see what was selling. Not as probably as much anymore, but retailers today in the craft beer industry want new innovation out there. Because if you look at craft beer, there's a lot of IPAs. There's a lot of other beers out there, but what's new and unique and it's just not an IPA out there. And I think that's what we're trying to bring to the party.\nBill Kirk: Excellent. And then, Carl, you mentioned that 4Q buy-in helps beer. Does that load-in explain the sequential difference for beverages in 1Q from that 4Q, about $8 million or so? And should we think about that before the ABI brands coming over? Should we think about that $24 million in beverages 1Q is like a pure volume consumption number, no load-in, no de-stock, that's more of a volume consumed type number?\nCarl Merton: So, I'll let Ty talk about the volume consumed, but on the profitability side and the margin side and then ultimately down to EBITDA, yes that is a portion of the decline that is going on in that space is just decreasing volume because you don't have that maintenance bias.\nIrwin Simon: Just let me jump on something there. I was just emailed by one of our employees some of our hemp products that were in Whole Foods, I won't mention the other retailer, but they saw them in Whole Foods and we picked up two other retailers because they were in Whole Foods. And sometimes Whole Foods is one of our best showrooms. So that is something that happened just to answer your question on that.\nTy Gilmore: And on the volume piece, Bill, I'd just say that consumption -- seasonality drives consumption. So I wouldn't use the word load-in, consumption peaks over times, over quarters. And like Carl said earlier, there is a higher seasonality in consumption of beer in our Q4, which is the start of the summer. And as we take on these new brands, as we look into our Q2, we expect to see kind of organic consumption to be in line with what everything else is doing.\nBill Kirk: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Zamparo with CIBC. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Zamparo: Thank you very much. Good morning. My question is on the regulatory side, and specifically if you do get the DEA following the HHS recommendation, what does that change for Tilray? Does it adjust your M&A strategy at all? Or would you need to see additional developments or clarity from different departments?\nIrwin Simon: So, I think I've been very clear in regards to classification here. Listen, I'd love to see it happen and I've been very clear. It does not affect us day one. But what it does, it helps get some confusion out of the market. The way cannabis is classified today is [indiscernible] same as heroin, the same as other drugs out there, that's absolutely not. Number two, I think from a medical standpoint, there are so many applications for it. And legalize it from a medical standpoint would be something very important. There is so much confusion out there on legalization and customers want it. I mean, basically it is legalized without being legalized because everywhere you walk, whether it's New York, California, no matter what state you're in, cannabis is being utilized. So, we might as well do something with it, collect the tax dollars, and ultimately get the regulatory in place where you're getting products out there that go through regulatory that are not cut with other drugs or other ingredients out there that are not safe. In regards to what ultimately the opportunities are for Tilray, listen, if one day, and again, this is hope, no reason to believe, if we could grow it in Canada and ship it into the U.S. is an opportunity for us. We have a big medical business in Europe. We have a medical business in Canada, which ultimately would get us into the business here in the U.S. So, I think first, there is ultimately no benefit to Tilray. I don't think anything is going to happen here for a little while, for over the next two years anyway, but it would basically be very, very, very good for the cannabis industry.\nJohn Zamparo: Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our analyst questions. We'll now proceed with questions submitted by retail stockholders on the Say Technologies platform. The question reads, why should we keep investing in Tilray?\nIrwin Simon: Listen, again, I hope by our results today and some of the things that we're doing, that number one, investors believe in the management team and believe in our strategy. Some don't believe in our strategy, but I will tell you, we have a defined strategy, we have a structured strategy with a lot of process and a lot of levers there that we're ultimately pulling to have a structured strategy. We are, secondly, a very diversified business, but ultimately how do they all come together under one common denominator. We're not just a cluster of a bunch of products, brands, and categories. And, upon legalization, we have multiple brands that can convert to cannabis. Ultimately, we have tremendous amount of grow. We have tremendous amount of production today. With our beer and our spirits business, we are one of the only ones with two cannabis grow facilities in Europe where we have a great medical platform. So, we're different than most other cannabis companies, we're different than most other craft beer businesses, we're different than any other healthier food business with our hemp Manitoba Harvest. So, we're absolutely different. We're a big believer in building brands, brand equity, brand equity, brand equity. And there's a lot of work we have to do on our brands in Canada and make consumers familiar with our brands. Again, cannabis has only been there for five years. And again, it's educating the consumers on the brands. And listen, it's hard to build brands when you're not legally allowed to advertise in the Canadian market to consumers. But we have to do that. Number two, we've got some great brands in regards to beer. We got great brands in regards to Breckenridge Bourbon and Manitoba Harvest, and we have a really, really strong relationships with doctors and distributors in the European market in regards to our medical business. Tilray Pharma, which was CC Pharma, is a distributor that distributes into 13,000 drug stores. We're looking to convert that business and working with other distributors throughout Europe of how we increase margins. Just think about it that's a $300 million business and every margin dollar that we increase there is a major contribution to our bottom-line. So with that we have a strategy. We are about making money and managing our balance sheet. Will it take some time to come together? It absolutely has been. But I'll tell you, the components are there. And I think that's what's different and unique. And that's why I hope our investors stay with us. And those that are, thank you very much. That is the questions for today. I want thank all that have joined the call, all that have gone online to listen to us. Listen, I can reassure you this here, the cannabis industry is a tough industry. The beer industry is a tough industry. But there's no business, there's no industry out there that's not tough. But what's important today is that you have a team that knows how to deal with the toughness, knows how to deal with the environment. And today, with the acquisition of the Anheuser-Busch businesses, we have close to 2,300 employees around the world that are working hard every day. And just remember, in 2019, we were a $50 million business. Today, on the run rate, to be close to $1 billion business. We were not diversified. We have a diversified portfolio. We have diversified brands. We have diversified facilities that are out there around the world. The world today is looking for innovation, looking for new products, and looking for new things. And again, consumers want cannabis. Consumers want to drink beer for the right reasons. Consumers want to drink bourbon. Consumers want medical cannabis for pain, for anxiety, for sleep, for cancer patients, for epilepsy. So, there's so many opportunities and we're in the right areas today where consumer demand will continue to move into. With the combination of Aphria, Tilray, HEXO, SweetWater, Montauk, and the eight brands that we just acquired from Anheuser-Busch, we've got a great portfolio of a lot of things. And with 5 million square feet of growth, we're going to repurpose these, and ultimately, how do we make it work. If not, there's, ultimately we can sell these off. So, there's plenty of levers to pull within Tilray today. Again, I want to thank everybody for being on the call listening to us and look forward to speaking to you again at our next earnings call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
