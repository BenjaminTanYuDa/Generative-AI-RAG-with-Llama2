        "content": "Dave Gennarelli: Hi, everybody. Welcome to Okta's Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Webcast. I'm Dave Gennarelli, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Okta. With me in today's meeting, we have Todd McKinnon, our Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, and Brett Tighe, our Chief Financial Officer. At around the same time that the earnings press release hit the wire, we posted supplemental commentary to the IR website. This posted commentary contains a large portion of what would historically be the opening commentary, including customer commentary, product-related news, and a review of our financial results. This new format allows listeners to review that information before this call. It also allows us to spend more time discussing other news items and strategy while leaving more time for Q&A. Today's meeting will include forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook and market positioning. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date made. Information on factors that could affect our financial results is included in our filings with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our previously filed Form 10-Q. In addition, during today's meeting, we will discuss non-GAAP financial results. Though we may not state it explicitly during the meeting, all references to profitability are non-GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and a discussion of the limitations of using non-GAAP measures versus their closest GAAP equivalents is available in our earnings release. You can also find more detailed information in our supplemental financial materials, which include trended financial statements and key metrics posted on our Investor Relations website. In today's meeting we will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-over-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Todd McKinnon. Todd?\nTodd McKinnon: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We're pleased with the strength of the business to close out our FY ‘24. Q4 was highlighted by record quarterly profitability and cash flow and strong top line results. Our Q4 financial performance was solid and suggests minimal impact on our financial results stemming from the security incident. The incident is now behind us, but we're using the learnings to reassess and strengthen the security aspects of our own infrastructure, as well as help ensure customers benefit from our experience by further strengthening our products and policies. This morning, we launched an initiative called the Okta Secure Identity Commitment, which is our long-term commitment to lead the industry in the fight against identity attacks. This new initiative encompasses Project Bedrock, which is aimed at hardening our ancillary and corporate systems and further strengthening our products and services. The Okta Secure Identity Commitment extends even further to champion customer best practices that enable our customers to be highly protected and elevate our industry to be more secure from identity attacks. We want our customers to benefit from our depth of experience, so we are further strengthening our customer policies to help ensure our products are deployed with Okta's best security practices. Identity has become a primary attack vector and Okta is at the forefront of the fight against identity-based attacks. Okta ThreatInsights has detected and prevented over 2 billion malicious requests in the last 30 days alone. We've reduced credential stuffing attempts and malicious bot traffic by more than 90% for some of our largest customers just over the past 90 days. And we're shaping industry best practices with 100% of Okta employees using Okta FastPass with phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication. I encourage you to read more about the Okta Secure Identity Commitment in the blog we posted today. Of course, all of this has to be backed up with great products. Okta has long been the leader in modern access management. We've started tapping into two more large market opportunities with the launch of Okta Identity Governance last year and Okta Privileged Access just a few months ago. Okta is changing the game with our unified platform approach and we already have several customers that have turned to Okta for the combined benefits of our Access Management, Governance, and Privileged Access. We're helping organizations make it easier for their employees and users to safely access their applications and help protect them from today's threat actors. From time to time, we augment our organic innovation through M&A. Earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Spera Security, an identity security platform to provide our customers with richer insights and technology to elevate their identity security posture management. At the start of each new fiscal year, I'd like to you show you our top priorities as an organization. As you might expect, security is our top priority as a company for FY '25. This covers everything from driving a company culture with a security-first mindset to our own security architecture as well as our products and services. The second priority is reigniting our growth. The obvious end result pertains to topline across regions and products, but to get there, we need to focus on our overall go-to-market operational excellence, further increase our competitiveness in our core markets with enhancements to both our workforce and customer identity clouds and strengthen our growth vectors in key industries, newly introduced products and cross-cloud initiatives. Our third priority is scaling Okta from a technical perspective. Our goal is to set the company up for success in order to be a $5 billion and then a $10 billion-plus company. This means investing in changes to reduce operational friction and drive global scale. This priority is intended to help fuel the first two priorities of security and growth. Before wrapping up my comments, I want to congratulate Eric Kelleher on his promotion to President of Customer Experience and Communications. In this elevated role, Eric will oversee marketing, customer-first and communications and continue to go lead the go-to-market organization with Jon Addison, our Chief Revenue Officer. Eric has been with Okta for seven years, most recently as Chief Customer Officer. His primary focus will be driving growth, building brand loyalty and enhancing the overall customer experience. I'm pleased with the strength and stability of our current leadership team going into the new fiscal year. As we head into FY '25, I've never been more energized and excited about Okta's future. We're expanding on the world's most robust and modern identity platform, and we have a strong pipeline of products and functionality powered by Okta AI. All told, we're well positioned to capture the large market opportunity in front of us. And finally, I want to thank the entire Okta team for their tireless effort and thank you to our loyal customers and partners who put their trust in us every day. Now, here's Brett to cover the financial commentary and talk about how we're positioned for long-term profitable growth.\nBrett Tighe: Thanks, Todd, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Dave said at the top of the call, we've evolved our earnings call format. Most of my typical review of the quarterly financials was published on Okta's Investor Relations website at the same time as the press release. I'll cover a few of the financial highlights, we will focus my commentary on broader topics before getting into our business outlook. I'll start by sharing our view on the security incident and the macro environment. When analyzing our key metrics, we couldn't attribute a quantifiable impact from the security incident on our Q4 results. While not quantifiable, the event likely had some level of impact. We'll continue to monitor this as we move through FY '25. All things considered, our solid Q4 financial performance suggests minimal impact on our financial results stemming from the security incident. The macro environment during Q4 was relatively consistent with what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of FY '24. In short, it's stable, but still challenging. Moving on to some financial highlights. We're pleased to achieve Rule of 40 again for FY '24. For FY '24, we generated a non-GAAP operating profit of 14% versus negative 1% last year. And free cash flow margin of 22%, up from 3% last year. That's tremendous progress for a single year. Our Q4 financial performance was highlighted by record profitability and cash flow. We were encouraged by our strong top line metrics and pipeline growth. Weighted average term length for our contracts signed in Q4 hit a two-year high. We continue to see an increase in the number of sales reps selling both Workforce Identity Cloud and Customer Identity Cloud products and experienced particular strength with large customers. We signed a record number of million dollar plus ARR contracts in Q4, capping a year in which the number of million dollar ARR contracts increased by over 30%. We added 150 customers in the quarter. The sequential decline in new customer adds reflects ongoing business trends of increased weighting of upsell versus new business resulting from the current macro environment and strength with large enterprise customers versus SMBs. Now I'm going to address one of the actions we're taking to drive new business and reignite new customer acquisition. Starting at the beginning of this quarter, we shifted our direct sales team that focuses on the SMB market in the Americas to what's commonly referred to as a hunter-farmer model. That means we now have a team of account executives focused on driving new customer acquisition and a separate team of account executives focused on upsells within our installed base. We believe that we're still very underpenetrated within our existing base of nearly 19,000 customers. This natural evolution will enable us to drive better results with both new and existing customers. Over the past several quarters, one of our strongest customer segments has been with large million dollar plus ACV customers. Our indirect partner ecosystem has played an important role in our success in this area. In fact, eight of our top 10 deals in Q4 were either resold or influenced by partners. From our traditional ISVs, system integrators and solution providers, these partners help us scale and provide tangible value-add to our customers. Recall that we introduced a new partnering framework called Elevate last year. The new program recognizes and rewards partners for the total value they deliver to Okta and our customers from finding, developing and influencing to delivering, managing and transacting. Today, more than 40% of our business mix is invoiced through our indirect channel partners, up from about one-third just a couple of years ago, and channel partners help influence an even greater percentage of our business, helping drive that number is the strong contribution from the AWS marketplace. Okta continues to be a premier identity and access management partner for AWS globally. AWS now generates over $175 million in annual contract value for Okta, growing at over 130%. We look forward to even more success as we go forward. We're also starting new market routes to broaden Okta’s availability further. We recently entered into an agreement with SoftBank Corporation as a managed service provider in the Japanese market. SoftBank is embedding a customized version of Okta Workforce Identity Cloud into its recently launched business concierge device management. This allows us to reach the approximately 16,000 Japanese companies and 2.4 million devices that utilize the managed service. It's the beginning of what we believe will be a new strategic path to market and the first step in an exciting new go-to-market motion for Okta. One last item I'd like to call out before turning to our outlook is share dilution. Actions we've taken over the past two years to reduce dilution have yielded great results. Building on that progress, starting in Q1, we will settle employees' tax obligation [due at] (ph) equity vesting through the net share settlement method. This will lower dilution because instead of issuing and settling shares into the market to cover the withholding tax, we will fund the estimated tax payment from corporate cash. In FY '25, we expect this change will reduce dilution by approximately 1.7 million shares compared to our prior tax withholding method. Ultimately, making for a 1% benefit to our basic share count. This will have no impact on free cash flow. Now let's turn to our business outlook for Q1 and FY '25. Over the course of the past several quarters, we've put significant effort into positioning the company for profitable growth for years to come. Over the past 18 months, the actions we've taken to drive efficiencies in our cost structure have yielded impressive results. The headcount reduction action we took earlier this month was part of our ongoing assessment to optimize our cost structure. The action also supports our strategy of increasing headcount in high talent, lower cost regions such as India and Poland. The majority of the approximately 400 positions that were eliminated were in supporting roles within the go-to-market team. As always, we take a prudent approach to forward guidance. We are factoring in a stable but still challenging macro environment consistent with what we experienced over the past few quarters. And while our Q4 results were solid, we're operating some conservatism into our outlook as we continue to monitor potential impacts related to the October security incident. And lastly, while we are still finalizing our FY '25 model, when we provided our preliminary FY '25 outlook last quarter, the expected cost savings from the headcount reduction was factored into those assumptions. Again, you can view the more granular guidance details in our press release or posted commentary. For the first quarter of FY '25, we expect total revenue growth of 16% to 17%, current RPO growth of 13%, non-GAAP operating margin of 18% and free cash flow margin of approximately 25%, which is inclusive of a cash impact of approximately $24 million related to the headcount reduction. We are raising our outlook across the board for the full year FY '25. We now expect total revenue growth of 10% to 11%, non-GAAP operating margin of 18% to 19% and a free cash flow margin of approximately 21%. To wrap things up, we are confident that we've set the path of profitable growth for years to come. We continue to focus on initiatives to drive the top line while making significant progress to drive improvements to our operating and cash flow margins. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for Q&A. Dave?\nA - Dave Gennarelli: Great. Thanks, Brett. I see that there are quite a few hands raised already, and I'll take them in order. And in the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question, so that we can get to everyone. And then you're welcome to queue back up with additional questions. So with that, first up, I see Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Brian?\nBrian Essex: Yeah. Thanks, Dave, and congrats on the nice results, team Okta. Maybe, Todd, for you, my one question. Could you maybe address what you're seeing on the macro side? I understand your comments and Brett's comments and just trying to understand what you're seeing that may give you better confidence in better performance into next year? Are you seeing things improve? And do you anticipate better traction in the mid-market? Or are you going to continue to rely on large enterprise? And maybe part C of that, could you maybe disaggregate a little bit gross retention versus upsell, cross-sell, so we can get an understanding of what underlying the net dollar retention metrics is really moving from quarter-to-quarter?\nTodd McKinnon: The macro is, I would call it stable, but it's definitely more challenging than it was. I mean, this is kind of an obvious statement, but it's definitely more challenging than it was a couple of years ago. So we -- as we look forward to the business in FY '25 and beyond, we're kind of assuming that this is the new normal, that the macro is challenging but stable and that's kind of how we're thinking about the business. The other maybe more color there for you is, it's pretty different between large organizations, and I would call it mid-enterprise and below. I would say large organizations are, seem to have more willing to invest in technology. And I think it's a combination of identity to them is maybe more of a priority to other segments because they have so much technology and they have such an imperative to move to the cloud and modernize and the business value and the number of people that they can secure and manage and the projects they can drive have big ROI. So it's almost like the macro economy is better, although I know technically, that's probably not true. It seems better in the large enterprise for us. And I think you see that in the results with the million dollar deals up over 30%. And a quick anecdote there as we -- I talked about in the prepared remarks we posted, I talked about a telecommunications company in North America that had -- was a sizable transaction for us in Q4. I mean, they had -- their legacy identity product was coming off support. So they had no choice. It was like that they've been there for 10, 15 years, and it was coming off support, and they needed to replace it. So I mean, and I don't think a lot of many mid-market companies, they don't really have -- they have maybe on-prem active directory. They don't really have much legacy identity. So there's an example of why in the large enterprise, some of these -- it not even a macroeconomic thing, it's like they have business problems they have to solve, and they have situations and their technology stack they're evolving and we can be there to help them.\nBrian Essex: Right. Got it.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, your question on the -- do a quick comment on the -- you asked a question about retention?\nBrian Essex: Yeah, as part of that. Yeah.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. The gross retention remains healthy in the mid-90s. I think the net retention number as you saw in the results came down a bit. It’s -- I think the -- in terms of growth, as the growth slows down, we don't do as many upsells relative to what we did in the past, the year-over-year comparisons compress a little bit, but we're -- the gross retention is healthy in the mid-90s. And as we continue to focus our efforts on reaccelerating growth, we expect that to happen over time.\nBrett Tighe: I would just add, Brian. One of those macro components that we look at are seat upsells on the workforce side and MAU-upsells on the customer identity side and that continues to feel like headwind, right, because there just isn't as much expectation in terms of economic activity, which can be seen in either one of those, either the workforce side or the customer identity side. So really, the strength on the upsell side is really coming from cross-sell, right? So whether it being IGA or more -- customer identity or workforce identity going in one direction or the other, it's really in that cross-sell where we've seen the strength over the last few quarters we've talked about it. So it's really still that, okay look, being prudent about licensed counts, I think, is something that people are still doing out there. And you see that reflected in the net retention rate, as you see it here today.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: No problem. Next, let's go to Eric Heath at KeyBanc.\nEric Heath: Thanks, Dave. And I'll also echo, nice set of results here. Todd, I wanted to follow up on your opening remarks. I'm curious to hear more about those comments about the security incident being behind you at this point. Was that more so a comment about the security enhancements you implemented internally? Or is that more so a comment about sales cycles? And customers at this point, getting more comfortable with the steps you’ve implemented and their willingness to make a commitment to Okta. And then if I could ask one for Brett, just along the similar line of questioning, the customer logo ads were a little bit weaker this quarter. So just curious if there's all, in any case, just a little bit more pressure on the new logo as a result of that?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, Eric, it's interesting. When we say this, the issue is behind us. What we really mean is that the specific issue from October, closing that out, having the third party report released, and addressing customers’ specific concerns about that incident, that's what we mean when we say behind us. But security is an ever present thing. And we're -- as we have after this issue and we continue to really ramp up the whole cyber focus of the entire company internally, externally. In fact, our -- the thing we just launched today, which is a very important initiative for Okta, which is called the Okta Secure Identity Commitment, that's our way to talk about this plan broadly over the next several quarters and several years, all the things we're doing from hardening our corporate infrastructure continuously and with a heightened focus to making sure our products not only come out of the box by default secure, but also we're investing in product capabilities that will proactively secure all identities in infrastructure, whether it's identity threat protection with Okta AI or new acquisition of a company called Spera. We're very excited about the specific identity security capabilities in our products and then elevating the entire industry to protect -- help protect against identity attacks. 85% of data breaches involve identity, and there's an identity attack, there's an account loss, there's a password stuffing attack in part of the attack chain. And so it's a big opportunity to prevent and impact overall cyber by elevating the whole industry's posture toward identity-based attacks. And then we want to make sure that customers specifically learn from our experience in with this issue. And when I talk to customers, as I have, as you can imagine, dozens and dozens and dozens of customers, in depth conversations about security and our security issue, they want to know about this issue and we talk about the specifics of this issue. But then very quickly it moves to, all right, Okta, help me as a partner, how do we comprehensively think about our own security and our posture and how can we be protected better against identity attacks and it turns very proactive. And so it's an ongoing thing and it's what the customers expect of us and it's what we expect of ourselves and we'll continue to focus on it.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, I’d just add to that in the sense of from a financial perspective, you heard Todd talk about our top priorities for the year. Those were in funding order, right? So security being number one. So we are definitely investing a lot of money into the variety of areas that Todd talked about there to ensure that we bolster those. So it's -- just want to make sure if you guys are thinking about your P&L, it's something we are definitely investing in, in a heavy way. Because it is the number one priority for us as a company, we take it very seriously. To your question, Eric, around customer account, look, the customer account trend, in adding 150 net ads, as you saw in the quarter, is really just an extension of the trends that we've seen over the last several quarters. If you remember what we've talked about in the past, I'd say about four or five quarters, the mix of business, both from a bookings perspective and a pipeline perspective, have been much more tilted toward upsell than historically has been. And so you see that outcome in terms of the customer account numbers that we're showing you here today. But it's also something to highlight that Todd was actually talking about earlier around having success in the larger businesses and being a little bit, a little more challenged in the small and medium sized businesses. It's the reason why we're going to this hunter-farmer model in the small and medium sized business segment in the Americas, right? So we want to be able to focus on -- have the team focus on new logo acquisition because we want to be able to acquire new logos. If you remember the investor presentation from, I think November 22 of -- at Oktane, I showed you guys a slide where we talked about annual cohorts and how they upsell over time and they're very consistent over time. So as we looked at the data throughout the fiscal year and contemplated a change, new logo acquisition was clearly at the top of the list when we're thinking about this change to a hunter-farmer in the commercial area of our business. And obviously new logos is important, but upsells is just as important as well. So that's why we want to focus there in that area as well. Because bottom line is, we've got a lot of products to sell now. So we need to add a little bit of specialization into the field and help them. Because I mean, look at all these great products that have been coming out, Governance, PAM, you look at the customer identity side, you see fine-grained authorization, you think -- see Security Center, highly regulated identity. I mean, there's a lot of stuff coming out and we want to be able to enable the field to be as productive as possible. So ultimately the hunter-farmer here is something we've been thinking about and now we're implementing as we go into FY ‘25 because we think it's the best way to profitably grow the business.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. Let's go to Hamza Fodderwala at Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Great. Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a strong finish to the year. Brett, I was really surprised by your comment around average contract term. I think you said being at a two-year high. I think the trend was maybe shifting down a little bit on the duration front. So I'm curious, how did you guys turn that around? What do you think it means as far as customers committing with Okta longer term? And is there anything that we should consider throughout the year as it relates to RPO and CRPO metrics with respect to duration? Thank you.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, we're very pleased to see the contract duration uptick. It up-ticked actually across all of the major categories if you think about new business versus renewals. So we saw it on both sides. So I think it's really just indicating how much people are committing to us. But also at the same time, we talked about earlier around the book of business that -- the incremental book of business in Q4 was more larger customers and larger customers tend to sign longer deals, right? So if you did a bunch of small deals, you're going to see a little bit of a headwind on contract duration. You sign a bunch of larger customers, typically you're going to see a little longer contract duration. So yeah, we're pleased to see the uptick in total RPO growth, 13% from, I believe it was 8% last quarter. And so I can't comment in terms of what it looks like going forward, but it does look good for us right now. And we're excited about how FY ‘25 may play out, assuming this trend continues.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, we have Peter Levine at Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Thanks guys for taking my question. Maybe, Todd, just for the quarter, I think your commentary around not seeing as much of an impact, is there anything different that you did over the past couple of months versus the incident in ‘22 that kind of gave customers a little bit more reassurance around what you're doing, the product security?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, it's interesting. It feels very similar to me. And the playbook is pretty straightforward. It's a lot of communication, a lot of specific meetings for customers that have concerns about this issue, concerns about broader issues of cyber in the company, and again, evolve into a conversation that's more proactive about what can we do together as partners. So it feels very similar to me in terms of the motion of the company afterwards. I do think that the -- definitely we spent so much time on it. And I don't just mean the executive team and myself, but the entire go-to-market organization, which by the way, did an amazing job in Q4. I really want to call out the entire go-to-market organizations for stepping up and delivering a solid result in Q4. But it's a lot of time, it's a lot of focus, a lot of conversations, a lot of managing, and in sales cycles especially, a lot of our deals are strategic and they can get complex and any time you have to manage through an escalation about a security issue, it's -- you kind of -- it kind of slows things down and that's the headwind to closing deal. So it's -- it clearly had some impact, but it's just -- it's hard to quantify it when you look at close rates, when you look at the results versus guidance, when you look at growth, it's hard to quantify it. So we're happy with the results and continuing even being more vocal and more proactive about communicating about security and specifically around how we can do more to help against overall identity-based attacks. And people don't realize that every -- the last 30 days, we blocked 2 billion malicious attacks against our customers. So identity attacks are, we had an identity attack against us in October and they happen all the time. And we all need to do a better job of stepping up and proactively defending our customers and the entire industry against them. And that’s -- you'll see a lot of the focus shifting toward that proactive level of dialogue and discourse versus more of the reactive that we started from in October.\nPeter Levine: All right. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Madeline Brooks at BofA.\nMadeline Brooks: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I look at results of 16% CRPO growth versus 12%, that's a pretty sizable beat, especially given today's economy. So I'm just wondering if there were any, one-off more large deals? I know you mentioned just larger deals in general, but any that were kind of more larger than just that $1 million mark versus -- or was it just more of a broader base pick up in the pipeline? I mean, I guess I'm just trying to marry the size of the beat and seeing if there's anything that could be like a one-time factor versus going forward, a trend that's reversing?\nTodd McKinnon: We had nothing, I mean the overall trend of million dollar deals was strong as we mentioned, growing 30%. There wasn't a one-off big deal that was really outsized compared to prior periods. So yeah, I would say it's more of a broad range or broad based strength in the large customers.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, I would just add in there, Madeline, just echoing what Todd said, we just had a really good quarter from large deals in general. But when I say large deals, it’s not just the million dollar deals, but a lot of deals from $100,000 up, right? Because if you think about the $100,000 customers, the average ACV is the largest it's ever been. So going and penetrating those large customers and getting good size deals out of them in addition to those million dollar contracts, the ARR contracts, which was a record in the quarter, it's just all around. There was a lot of good momentum in large deals. Just really nice job market team just in general across the board. I'm going to echo on what Todd said. I should have said in the first answer, which is go-to-market did a great job and we're both super proud of them.\nMadeline Brooks: And just to clarify, I mean, I guess this is more of a surprise on your end or was it like kind of pull-forward demand that you could see?\nTodd McKinnon: I think the large deal pipeline was healthy. So it was nice to see it materialize, especially with -- given some uncertainty with the security issue. It was nice to see it materialize, but it wasn't unforeseen. We knew we had a healthy large-deal pipeline. And that's true for the pipeline overall going into FY ‘25. The pipeline overall for FY ‘25 is quite a bit stronger than it was going into FY ‘24. So it's one of the reasons why as we guide to FY ’25, we have a level of comfort in that guidance.\nMadeline Brooks: Great. Thank you so much.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, let's go to Rudy Kessinger at DADCO.\nRudy Kessinger: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Not much commentary, I think in the prepared remarks you posted or the early part of the call here about Privileged Access. I know it's only been out a few months now, but just what's been the early traction with it? What kind of pricing uplift are you seeing with customers who are adopting it and any other color you can share on that front?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah I would say it's on track, maybe exceeding expectations. It's is very early We were successful in converting the early access customers that we had targeted. They're liking the product, they're seeing results with the product. And more importantly, I think it's -- they're seeing the synergy with the rest of our platform. That's the idea. It's really a new kind of privileged access. It's a privileged access that's modern, it's quicker to deploy, it's cloud-native, and it's integrated to governance and the rest of the access management stack that Okta provides. So it's a -- not only just a -- if you think about the privileged access market and a potential TAM for us, and we've talked about this before, I think the better way to think about it is really a new TAM, which is the companies that really don't have a privileged access solution today versus the companies that have deployed legacy on-prem privileged access solutions that they host as software in their own data centers. This is like a new kind of product, and it's built for more modern infrastructures with cloud-based servers and Kubernetes clusters. And most importantly, it's built to really sit next to Okta Access Management and phishing resistant authentication into these things and governance products that's modern and connects into collaboration tools to make the governance process seamless. That's the target. And we're seeing early, but positive indications of customers having that kind of value proposition. And we think that just to quantify the potential uplift, we think the normal workforce spend is x, we think governance can be a 30% uplift over that, and then privilege can be another 30% as well. So that's kind of how we're thinking, and we're seeing early indications that that's true. Obviously, we have much more data on the governance side, which is at a full year in GA, and we've seen very strong track record of 30% plus uplift for the governance product over and above workforce. And the early indications are -- from PAM are similar in terms of the potential uplift.\nBrett Tighe: The other thing I might add is what Todd was talking about having this product suite across access management, governance and PAM, having a single pane of glass, if you will, we've already got a handful of customers that have all three this early on and see that vision and believe in that strategic direction that we're going. So exciting early times for us in terms of that, the three pillars on the workforce side of the house.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, that's -- one more on that. Sorry, Dave. That is very differentiated. No one else has that. No one else has access management, privilege access and governance. CyberArk has privilege, of course, super strong in that. And they have some access management with an acquisition they did and governance is lacking. Other vendors don't have privilege as well as governance and we're the first vendor to have all three. So if this theory is right and customers want this converged platform and it can lead to better security outcomes and more flexibility, we're going to benefit from that for a long time.\nDave Gennarelli: Super. Let's go to Rob Owens at Piper.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could drill down a little bit around that NRR metric? And just noting that it had been flattish kind of the prior three quarters. So with this fall off, just kind of trying to understand that that point in time NRR relative to a lot of your commentary in terms of seeing no fall off and/or kind of the upsell cross-sell motion that you saw success with. Thanks.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, thanks Rob. In terms of NRR, I know Rob you've been following along but for everybody else, there's a lot of -- there's been several quarters now we've talked about how this is going to decline. I think we started talking about in late FY ‘23, and it's on the back of the macro challenges that we've seen out there in terms of what I was talking about earlier around seat upsells, right? Cross-sells have been doing well, but we're not doing as well on those seat upsells or MAU upsells on the customer identity side, and that creates a headwind to the NRR metric. And so we did land roughly in the range where we expected to. So nice job by the finance team predicting that, but it landed right at 111%. And I think probably the question behind the question, Rob, is like, where do we think it's going to go from here? Right?\nRob Owens: Yeah, absolutely.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah. I mean, like we said today earlier, we had good gross retention, mid 90s, like we've talked about for several quarters now. And so where do we think it's going in FY ‘25? Based on our new business versus upsell mix expectations in FY ‘25, based on what we can see in the pipeline today, based on how the business has performed throughout FY ‘24, we see us kind of trending in this 111% range. Now there's a potential for the balance of FY ‘25. We haven't done anything beyond FY ‘26. But there is a potential it could swing a couple points either direction, and that's really going to boil down to how good our new business versus upsell mix assumptions are. So if we have more new business in a quarter and it crowds out upsell, well, that's going to be a little bit of a headwind to net retention. If we have a little bit better upsell quarter than we expected in terms of mix, well, it's going to be a little bit of a tailwind to net retention. So we think we trend in this kind of channel of a couple of points plus or minus this 111% where we are today for the balance of FY ‘25.\nRob Owens: Thanks for the color, Brett.\nBrett Tighe: No problem.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Joe Gallo at Jefferies.\nJoe Gallo: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and nice fourth quarter. I understand conservative, but maybe just walk us through your CRPO guide in 1Q, which I think is the first ever sequential decline. And then Todd, your second priority was reigniting growth. What are the biggest upside catalysts there? Is it international, CIAM, IGA, PAM, cross-sell? Maybe just help us unpack where the highest ROI upside catalysts are in the top…\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, I'll start with that one. We're super focused on that. I think the biggest catalyst is sales productivity. We've talked about this for a while. The pattern of ramping tenure of the sales team, the familiarity with both of our major product lines, workforce and customer. And we're seeing sales productivity, it's really at a nice place now in terms of, I'm sorry, we're seeing sales tenure really at a nice place now. And we're also starting to see the productivity ramp into that. It still has a -- I think we could still see more ramp over the next couple quarters. But that's going to be a nice boost overall for growth. I would say that's the most near-term, most quantifiable potential driver there, which is something we've managed in terms of enabling salespeople and making sure they have a chance to be successful and stick around. We focused a lot on the transition into this fiscal year in terms of keeping stability, in terms of quota-carrying reps and assigning them to territories and targets and having continuity there to get off to a fast start the first half of this year. Again, coming off what I thought the team did a great job in Q4. So I'd say that's a big driver, particularly in the short term. I think after that, I would say the biggest driver is opportunity in the large deals, large enterprise. It's an area where, relatively speaking, Okta has a lot of potential. I would call us really a enterprise -- mid-enterprise company in global 2000 largest enterprises in the world. We've made good progress, but we can do a lot more. And I think that's a big growth driver going forward. I think maybe it's kind of a parallel to that second one, which is customer identity is still a big opportunity for us. We think over time it could be half of the business and the stats we talked about today, it's still 40% of the business and growing faster than workforce, but I think it could grow even faster than it is now. So I think those are a couple three I would highlight, but there's a lot that goes into all those from just broadly speaking, running a highly efficient, highly effective go-to-market organizations, continuing to have the products of all, so that the products can address the really compelling use cases both in customer identity and workforce identity. They can address the needs of small companies, medium companies, large companies across the board. There's a lot that goes into those growth drivers, but we are very focused on growth. We think this is a big market opportunity. We think there's various reasons why our growth is decelerated. We're not satisfied with that. We want to get it going the other direction as fast as we can.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, I would just add before I get into the current RPO question. On the customer identity side, you heard me talk about earlier about the percentage of reps selling customer identity continues to go up into the right. But it's still not, to Todd's point about if we want to be a 50-50 business, it's still not 50-50. Right? So we can improve there. And one of the things we did actually last week, at our sales kickoff, we spent a good amount of time enabling the field around customer identity. We took almost all Friday to do that. So it's an important area for us. We're also going to change some of the ways we do operations internally, like when you're talking about deals, you're talking about pipeline management, putting a little bit more of a tilt on customer identity versus workforce identity. So it's -- there's some things under the covers that we're doing that, that effectively are very operational in nature, but ultimately we believe will result in better productivity from a customer identity perspective. Because like I said, the trends are in the right direction, but if we keep tweaking and make a few changes, we think we can do even better. Back to your question on current RPO. Q1, just as a reminder, at these growth levels, we will see, it's kind of like revenue. There's -- Q1 has some interesting dynamics to it. In terms of current RPO, because Q1 is our seasonally smallest bookings quarter compared to Q4 is our seasonally usually the largest bookings quarter, you can get this mechanic of a quarter-over-quarter decline in terms of dollars. And so that's something to expect not just this year, but in years going forward. So this won't be hopefully a surprise when we talk in 12 months time that this mechanic is likely going to happen. Again, just because of the seasonality of our business and as Todd and I have talked about a lot over today, we're an enterprise focused business and that usually means -- the seasonal trends mean that Q4 is the biggest one and Q1 is the smallest one in terms of bookings.\nJoe Gallo: Thanks guys.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Trevor Rambo at BTIG.\nTrevor Rambo: Hi guys, this is Trevor on Gray. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe touching back on OIG, so it's been live for a little over a year now. When do you think you guys are going to give out any stats on ACV or revenue as it becomes kind of a more material part of the business? And kind of what's -- in a broader sense, what's your longer term vision for the product and how big do you think it could get relative to your core workforce IAM in the next two, three, four years?\nTodd McKinnon: We're very excited about it and it's really has, since we put it into GA a year ago, it's exceeded our expectations quarter after quarter after quarter. The -- one part of the impact of it is, it not only is an upsell, and we've talked about the 30% plus upsell it could be for a workforce customer, it also just makes the whole vision more compelling and makes our product suite, especially once you add PAM to the mix, it makes the whole product suite more compelling. So I think even beyond the revenue from that SKU, it has even a bigger impact strategically to our workforce business than that. So that's one interesting thing. And I think over time, that is also the answer to your question about how big could it be. I think we could kind of size it out, but I think the -- and you can look at IDC and IDC breaks down the various segments of identity and they gave it a certain portion. But I think over time, it's going to be harder to really -- it's going to be harder to tease out the, how many new customers were landed because we had this suite, how many customers were really the killer thing they wanted was privileged access, and they bought the other, the access management and the features and capabilities there, and the identity governance, how much that was kind of along for the ride. You're going to kind of think about it as just one compelling offer for workforce. But that's kind of how we think about it.\nTrevor Rambo: Great. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Yeah, let's go to Peter Weed at Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. [And glad to see the] (ph) expanding free cash flow, I know it's been a long effort and it's really great to see that direction going on. I think this quarter, the one thing that that kind of jumped out at me was kind of the more modest number of kind of net new customers that were landed. And particularly you've emphasized, it's not like churn went up. And so like, technically you landed the same number, but it was just -- because there was drag from fewer businesses coming in. When you look at that result, is that kind of a new normal? Or Is that something where you'd anticipate it start starting to step back up that the sales programs that that you're putting into place with the hunters versus the farmers that this gets back into the last few quarters? We've been plus or minus 50 around 400 that new customers. Like, what was unique about Q4, where, like, I would have thought Q4 is a period where you could outperform, right? Because that is where there's more bookings, more customers doing deals, that period. What was unique about this fourth quarter where that really kind of [drag] (ph) down?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, we don't want this to be the case. This is not the new normal. We want to drive growth, and we're aggressively trying to work on and prioritize and focus on things that will drive growth. And customer account is one of those areas. So I think we have a -- we've talked about the focus of the go-to-market team in the corporate segment in North America to be focused on upselling in existing customers versus going out and attracting new customers. And that's a big structural change. And I think you're seeing it's one of many changes that we've made coming into this fiscal year that are -- really you're seeing John and Eric and Eugenio really lay down what they think are the strategic priorities for go-to-market. Brett talked about a couple of them in addition, whether it's the operational changes and the -- to make it easier, more effective to sell customer identity, whether it's the hunter-farmer change in corporate North America is really important. A lot of the pipeline and marketing execution changes have been done by Eric and Kerry and the marketing team. So you're seeing a lot of very strategic thoughtful programs put in place that are going to have this goal which is to reignite growth which is incredibly important. Specifically on customer account, I think when I look at the numbers, Q4 is, I think it's just an example of, for whatever reason, the big companies perform better than the customer account in the smaller companies. Maybe just a one-off. I don't think it's, like I said, I don't think it's a new normal. I do think we have to remember that the customer account is largely driven by smaller customers. The variations there show up much bigger in that cohort of customers. The specific things we're doing for customer account, we mentioned beyond hunter-farmer are, one of the things is that we have a program we're really excited about is this managed service provider program. We mentioned SoftBank, and they now have a custom, or a MSP version of Okta, the workforce products, that they are selling as a managed service to their 16,000 companies in Japan. Now, we're not going to report those as our customers. We’re not -- that would be maybe not really apples to apples. But it is an example of something we're prioritizing to broaden our reach. Now, we will have the capability as we do more of those MSP deals around the world over time, those will not only impact the number of customers that those MSPs can move over to Okta, but also we will have some opportunities depending on how those deals flush out over time and how we arrange them. We'll have the opportunity to upsell those customers. So it'll be like a channel to gain customers in a more scalable way than direct, which is pretty powerful. The last thing I'll mention on customer count, it's kind of like MSPs, but we have many, many customers that are actually self-service customer identity customers that don't show up in our customer accounts. And they do, well, they don't show up in our customer accounts when they're paying us as a self-service customer, but when they upgrade to enterprise, they do. So it's a -- this self-service procurement from customer identity cloud is a similar channel we've been investing in and will continue to invest in, that can lead to broader new customer growth over time than just the direct model, which I think if you really want to get broad in the smaller companies, you have to have some of these programs to drive that expansion over time.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, I would just add one comment to that in the sense that I echo what Todd said. This is not the customer adds that we want to have, but it demonstrates that we can put together a pretty nice quarter just by going after the 19,000-ish customers we have today. There is a tremendous amount of room to run in our current customer base. And that's just something we're real proud of and we can really still access. And one of the reasons to go to the hunter-farmer is that, for the farmers to be able to go out and get additional business. So, yeah, I echo everything Todd just said, but just want to make sure you guys heard that as well.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. Next up is John DiFucci at Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. I think this question is for both of you guys, Todd and Brett. You have so much going on with changes to go-to-market and also early opportunities in IGA and PAM, and even CIAM. I guess, how do you think about balancing those huge opportunities with delivering that great cash flow this year? Peter talked about what you did this quarter, but you increased the cash flow guidance for the year. And I almost hate asking this question because I think investors really appreciate what you're doing on cash flow. But Brian asked my first question, my first two questions with the seven that he asked. So I guess I just want to make sure you're comfortable with your investments in both go-to-market and product to be able to sort of satisfy those because it just seems like, Todd, you painted that picture of the platform. That's huge and compelling.\nTodd McKinnon: I think some of it is, there's really three levers I look at. One is just with slower growth, there's more leverage. That's just how it works. I mean, we invest in go-to-market, and that investment takes some time to pay off. And when growth slows, and whether it's in the macro opportunity or the macro economy that's hit us over the last couple of years or some of the execution challenges we've had over the last couple of years, that pours leverage. And the model has a lot of leverage. So that shows up as cash or net income. The other lever is that we, I think, like a lot of companies, we're being more careful with our money and we're being more disciplined on our spending. And I think throughout the entire company, culturally people are understanding that it's -- money is, it's not zero interest rates, money's not free, it's not growth at all costs. We have to be more disciplined. And you're seeing we have a really smart, capable team and they're coming up with a lot of frugality and savings and efficiency and that we're able to either return to shareholders or show as profitability, or we're able to invest in other areas that can drive this growth. People ask me a lot about how are you funding this really, the Okta Secure Identity Commitment, how are you funding that? And isn't that costing you a lot of money? How could you be increasing profitability when you're spending there? And part of the answer is, well, we're really doing a good job finding efficiencies in other areas. But that specific example, it's a lot of the -- it's not as much spend as it is, like what do you prioritize? And making sure we prioritize security and have people focus on that and do things like we did in Q4 with a 90-day sprint and 90 day focus of that area and prioritize that. And then the last thing on this, John, is that there are some long-term structural things that we're investing in, that are actually investments that are decreasing some of the profitability in the short term, but are going to make sure that as we grow over the years to $5 billion and $10 billion and beyond, we're going to be set up to repeat these kind of growth at these profitability levels far into the future, whether it's investing in internal systems, whether that's making sure we have a healthy balance of high talent, low cost regions around the world, whether that's just internal automation projects that I've shared with many of you in one-on-one conversations before. So it's a little bit of a lot of that stuff. And I think I'm very proud of the company for the progress we've made and recognizing that we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity ahead of us.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, I would add, yeah, thank you to the entire company for helping us on this. It's not just me and Todd, we get to deliver the good news. It's really appreciated by both of us. But I would add to that, John, there is levels of -- because I think what you're getting out is are we spread too thin, right? How many things can we cover? And so if you look at some of the things we talked about today, it actually is a little, it's driving towards specialism, right? The hunter-farmer model itself is definitely a specialist approach because it's going to allow folks to be able to focus in on, okay, what's working really well here, as opposed to let's do a little bit of everything, right? And like, for example, on the farmer side, you're going to know what your customer are doing, how they're using it and what identity use cases we could solve. And so it'll force some specialization in the field, right? Just on that by itself, right? So I think that's -- one of the main reasons we're doing the hunter-farmer model is to be able to create that specialism because of what I said earlier, there's so much product out there right now. And just like you basically alluded to, we've got a lot of new products coming out, which is great, but we need to enable the field. And that's why we spend all that time at SKO, enabling, trying to enable the field even more on customer identity, right? So it's trying to take these focus bets in certain areas to be able to help ourselves, not just do scatter shot and have an efficiency that we've been driving for the last four to six quarters, where you see these free cash flow margin results or non-GAAP operating margin or any one of the margins that you could look at today. So it is -- we're focusing, we are trying to drive some levels of specialization, so we don't get spread too thin.\nJohn DiFucci: Makes sense guys. Keep it up. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. Jonathan Ho, William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. Just in terms of your channel engagement commentary, can you talk a little bit about what actions you're taking and what you expect to see? I guess, like, how do we measure your success in terms of that indirect channel engagement and things like the AWS Marketplace? Thank you.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, I can take that one. In terms of partners, like you heard us talk about earlier, relaunching our partner program, Elevate, early last year and focusing our efforts into a smaller number of partners. It's just actually kind of what John's question was a second ago, instead of doing so many things across the partner channel, we want to be able to drive focus. And so that's why you see the success in AWS. I mean, growing 130% year--ver year, I mean, at $175 million of ACV, that's a pretty large business just by itself, right? And so it's enabling focus and it's also tilting our company to be more partner-friendly, right? And so this metric that we gave you, the 40% of total, that is done on partner paper, we feel like that's a pretty good indicator of our progress. We were about a third, a couple of years ago, we're up to [40%] (ph). The influence level is higher than that, right? I mean, that's just purely on what the paper was sold on, not necessarily the influence. And so I think you should definitely continue to ask us questions about how that is trending up over time, that percentage or the percentage influence, how is it really going for us? We see a lot of good signs, but this is one of these areas that it's heading in the right direction, but we still feel like we could do a lot better in a variety of areas. And so you definitely keep asking questions about it.\nTodd McKinnon: For me, Jonathan, the -- qualitatively, our success and our presence and our impact and their impact with the global SIs is really important. As we move more and more into the global 2000 and bring our identity platform to the largest organizations of the world, the global SIs are a really important partner there. And I've been personally spending a fair amount of time working with the global SIs and our team that's working and fostering those relationships and driving those forward because all of these -- every big company that ever goes through an identity transformation or makes a big identity decision has a strong partner in one of the global SIs. And I think we've in the past, we haven't done as good of a job as we need to as being the right partner for the global SIs. And I think some of the things in the market that are changing are really helping us there. I think one of them is that the largest enterprises in the world more and more every day are doing more and more transition to the cloud. And this is the same thing we've all been talking about for seven plus years. And since we've been meeting as Okta as a public company, that cloud transformation really, really forces the need for identity and modern identity because the old models of identity don't work. And some of these large organizations are going through that now. And that puts a really fine point on their need for a new identity platform. And they go to ask the global SIs what they should do and the stronger our relationships can be with them and what -- strong as a partner for them as we're seeing, it's going to benefit us. So we're spending a lot of time on that. And the other thing that's happening in the market is that some of the traditional identity focused companies that are now private equity owned and are worrying about merging roadmaps and what platform is going to survive and what platform is not, it's really causing the global Sis and some of the large customers to question who's the right partner. And I think you have a confluence of things happening there that really set us up to be successful that I personally spent a lot of time on and very excited about.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. We're going to take two more questions. The first one from Roger Boyd and the second one from Andy Nowinksi. Roger?\nRoger Boyd: Oh great. Thanks for squeezing me in. As it relates to Spera and just the broader suite of identity security solutions you're building out, what's been the early feedback from customers on that direction? And can you just remind us about how you're thinking about monetizing versus speaking in some of these security solutions like ITDR as you push towards the goal of a more secure Okta? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Customers are super interested in -- they're super interested in both identity security and specifically the Spera acquisition. And I think you're seeing the whole identity security approach or market evolve from five years -- really three years ago, it was a very small kind of idea in market and it was really around on-prem active directory. It was like identity security means make sure on-prem active directory, doesn't have vulnerabilities or you can detect issues there. And now it's really starting to move toward as more companies move toward modern identity stacks like Okta, it's really moving toward not only how can you better secure things like Okta, but how can you better secure things like all the apps and all the cloud infrastructure? So you want a comprehensive view of all your identities and the risks of your identities, not only in on-prem active directory, but you also want it in Okta and Azure Active Directory and Amazon and Google and Salesforce and all these things. And so you're seeing customers really starting -- as they lean in and do more with modern identity, they're also at the same time saying, what is this class of tools and technologies and capabilities are going to protect that. And that's where offerings like identity threat protection with Okta AI or the Spera product are really going to help. And so I think in terms of how we're going to price and package and monetize these things, think of -- they're both additional capabilities with additional licensing fee and identity threat protection is kind of like the next version above advanced multifactor authentication. Think about it as advanced multi-factor authentication has some phishing resistant factors and some other capabilities and policy. Okta identity threat protection with Okta AI is really better integration with your entire security ecosystem and awesome powerful actions like universal logout. So it's really the next rung up in terms of the value and the pricing. And then Spera will be a similar thing. It'll be a capability that gives you visibility into not only Okta's posture, but also all the applications around Okta and gives you the central data warehouse to see these things and it'll be priced independently as well.\nDave Gennarelli: And our last question goes to Andy Nowinksi. Andy?\nAndy Nowinksi: Thank you. I appreciate you squeezing me in today, and congrats on a nice quarter. So I want to -- you talked a lot about the power of the platform today. And you mentioned a number of go-to-market strategies that you're implementing. But it doesn't sound like you're pursuing a similar strategy as Palo Alto, where they're incentivizing customers to buy the whole platform. I guess, did you consider a strategy like that to get to that revenue growth, the re-acceleration that you're targeting to maybe get there sooner?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, we think about all kinds of different strategies to price and package and do things like that. And I think when you look at it, how we've priced governance and privilege particularly, it's very conducive to buy them all in the pricing that we've announced. It's different than a -- and it's because they're so tightly related and it's so obvious that the buyer of one of those is going to want to buy all three. The way we've built the products and the way the specific use cases they attach. Customer identity and workforce identity is a little different. Oftentimes, it's a different buyer. It's a different member of the C-suite. And so there is some pricing advantage of getting them both from one vendor, but it's not as powerful as just having the workforce product that's usually sold to -- directly to security, directly to IT. So I think the customer identity part is a little bit not as directly related and something that we will consider over time as we broaden and expand, but we haven't changed that. We haven't really considered changing that. The one thing that is kind of the core of your question, which is really important, is that, and this is back to John's question too about trying to do so much and what are we focused on and how do we prioritize it all, the -- a lot of the efforts were in, whether it's customer identity, whether it's identity security, whether it's the different product areas we are going to, it's delivering -- it's directed by a very clear strategy which is, we are the leading independent neutral identity company by far. And we also believe strongly that the market and the whole industry needs an independent and neutral leader because that's going to mean choice and flexibility and better integration with the entire ecosystem and better value for customers, better security. And if you're going to do that, you have to have a product in every category. You have to have customer identity. You have to have a leading product in access management and privilege and governance. And so it's almost like our strategy has dictated that we have to have these product footholds in all of these areas. And that's what you're seeing us execute on. And it's been strategically consistent message that we've all talked about for seven plus years, and you'll see us continue to march forward for the next seven years and beyond toward that.\nAndy Nowinksi: Got it. Thanks, Todd.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. We appreciate everybody attending today. Apologies to those we didn't get to. We keep running long. So just to note, this quarter we'll be participating in the Morgan Stanley TMT conference in San Francisco next Tuesday the 5th, the KeyBanc Emerging Technology Summit in San Francisco next Wednesday the 6th, and the William Blair Tech Investors Virtual Conference on March 15th. And that's it for today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can reach us at investor@okta.com. Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Thanks, everyone.\nBrett Tighe: Bye-bye."

These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and the discussion of the limitations of using non-GAAP measures versus their closest GAAP equivalents is available in our earnings release. You can also find more detailed information in our supplemental financial materials, which include trended financial statements and key metrics posted on our Investor Relations website. In today's meeting, we will quote a number of numeric or growth changes, as well as discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-over-year comparison. Now, I'll turn the meeting over to Todd McKinnon. Todd?\nTodd McKinnon: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We want to kick off this call by addressing what's top of mind for everyone, so we're trying a new format this quarter. In light of the new security blog we posted this morning, we felt it was important to get the earnings release and guidance out before the market opened as well. At around the same time that the earnings press release hit the wire, we posted prepared remarks to the IR website, which contains some of my typical commentary around customer wins and other notable news from the quarter. This new format allows me to spend more time discussing the new information while also leaving more time for Q&A. I want to start by summarizing the update we shared in a blog post this morning related to the October security incident involving our support case management system. Upon deeper analysis of the event, we determined that the threat actor obtained the contact information of our support portal users across a significant portion of our customers, including the names and email addresses of all Okta admins, except customers in our FedRAMP High and DoD IL4 environments. While this information cannot be used to directly access an Okta environment and does not include user credentials or sensitive personal data, a threat actor may use the information for targeted phishing attempts. With this more detailed information, we felt strongly that sharing this information will help our customers better protect themselves against an increased risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. We have engaged a digital forensics firm to validate our findings and currently expect that they will complete their analysis in mid-December. Once finalized, we will share the report with customers and publicly. Now, let me address what Okta is doing to better protect ourselves from security threats. Over the years, we have dedicated significant resources towards securing our product environment. Given recent events, we recognize that we need to do more to improve the security architecture of our broader operations. That includes the applications we use, the hardware we deploy, and the vendors we work with. Over the past few weeks, we have taken several steps to further strengthen our security posture. We've initiated a hyper-focused security action plan by rallying the entire organization, as well as engaging with third-party security firms to fortify our team's efforts. The stakes are high, and we will do whatever it takes to protect our current and future customers. Bolstering our security environment is, by far, the highest priority for Okta. The job of securing the Okta ecosystem will never be done, but during this hyper-focused phase, no other project or even product development area is more important. In fact, the launch dates for the new products and features that we highlighted at Oktane last month will be pushed out approximately 90 days. The exception being Okta Privileged Access, which becomes generally available this week. Now, turning to our Q3 results. Top-line metrics were strong. We continue to experience particular strength with large customers. Similar to the past few quarters, our fastest growing cohort was customers with $1 million-plus ACV with growth of over 40%. It was also a strong quarter for new and upsells across our public sector vertical. We also produced record non-GAAP operating profit and record free cash flow in the quarter as we continue to demonstrate the leverage in our model. In other news, we're thrilled that Jon Addison, who has been our Interim CRO since the start of this fiscal year, has been appointed to the permanent position. With Jon's appointment as CRO and our continued confidence in the go-to-market leadership team, we have closed the search for a President of Worldwide Field Operations. Okta is driven by our vision to free everyone to safely use any technology. The measures we're taking to increase the security of Okta and our ecosystem gives us confidence in our ability to move forward. We will come out of this even stronger because Okta is the only modern platform for neutral and independent identity access management, governance, and now privilege access. Before turning it over to Brett, I want to thank our employees for their tireless efforts. I want to thank our customers and partners who put their trust in Okta every day. I also thank everyone who supported us at Oktane last month where we had over 4,000 people at the live event in San Francisco and over 19,000 viewing online. Now, I'll turn it to Brett to walk you through more details of our financial results and forward outlook.\nBrett Tighe: Thanks, Todd, and thank you everyone for joining us today. The actions we've taken over the past few quarters to drive efficiencies in our cost structure continue to yield impressive results. I'll review our third quarter results and our outlook, but first I'll start with some commentary on the macro environment. Macro headwinds, while stabilized, continue to impact our business. Metrics that we use to gauge the macro environment, such as contract duration, average deal size, and pipeline mix, were largely consistent with what we experienced in the first half of the year. Separately, we published the advisory regarding the recent security incident on October 20th, which was 11 days ago in the quarter. While business at the close of the quarter slowed somewhat, our overall financial performance in Q3 was strong. Turning to Q3 results. Total revenue growth for the third quarter was 21%, driven by a 22% increase in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue represented 97% of our total revenue. International revenue grew 20% and represented 21% of our total revenue. FX had a minor impact on total revenue growth, but was a 2-point headwind to international revenue growth. RPO or subscription backlog grew 8%. The general shortening of contract term lengths signed over the past several quarters has impacted total RPO growth. Our overall average term length remains just over two-and-a-half years. Current RPO, which represents subscription backlog we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months, grew 16% to $1.83 billion. Turning to retention. Consistent with prior quarters, gross retention rates remained strong in the mid-90% range. Our dollar-based net retention rate for the trailing 12-month period remained strong at 115% and was driven by both upsell and cross-sell activities. Similar to the past few quarters, macro-related pressure resulted in smaller seed expansions than in previous years. We believe this trend will persist in the current environment. The net retention rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as the mix of new business, renewals and upsells fluctuates. As I've noted previously, we've experienced a macro-related shift in our business mix to more upsell and cross-sell versus new business. Before turning to expense items and profitability, I'll point out that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results unless otherwise noted. Looking at operating expenses. Total operating expenses for the quarter were lower than expected. The better-than-expected profitability is due to the combination of revenue over performance and our continued focus on spend efficiency measures. Total headcount at the end of Q3 slightly increased sequentially to approximately 5,900. Q3 free cash flow was a record $150 million, yielding a free cash flow margin of 26%. Free cash flow was significantly better than expected, driven by billings and strong collections. During the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $150 million of our 2026 convertible debt notes. This resulted in an $18 million GAAP-only gain. Over the past three quarters, we've repurchased $900 million of debt, resulting in a $91 million GAAP-only gain. We will continue to regularly evaluate our capital structure and capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong, anchored by $2.13 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments position, net of remaining convertible debt, is $820 million. Now, let's turn to our business outlook for Q4 and FY '24 and a preliminary look at FY '25. As always, we take a prudent approach to forward guidance. We are factoring in a stable but still challenging macro environment. We're also factoring in the recent security incident. For the fourth quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue of $585 million to $587 million, representing growth of 15%; current RPO of $1.875 billion to $1.880 billion, representing growth of 11% to 12%; non-GAAP operating income of $102 million to $104 million, which yields a non-GAAP operating margin of 17% to 18%; and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.50 to $0.51, assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 180 million. For FY '24, we are raising our revenue outlook by $30 million at the high-end of the range. We now expect revenue of $2.243 billion to $2.245 billion, representing growth of 21%. We are raising our outlook for non-GAAP operating income by $65 million at the high-end to $283 million to $285 million, which yields a non-GAAP operating margin of 13%. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is raised to $1.47 to $1.48, assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $179 million. And we are raising our free cash flow margin outlook for FY '24 to 19% from 15% previously. On a dollar basis, that's a raise of over $90 million and sets us up to close the year achieving the Rule of 40. While we are still in the early phases of financial planning, we would like to provide a preliminary view of FY '25. I'll reiterate that we are prudently factoring in a stable but challenging macro environment as well as potential impacts from the recent security incident. We continue to focus on expense control and estimate a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17%. We're also targeting free cash flow margin to be at least 19%. From a revenue perspective, we estimate total revenue to be in the range of $2.460 billion to $2.470 billion or growth of approximately 10%. We are applying a static 26% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '24 and FY '25. To wrap things up, we are confident that we've set the path of profitable growth for years to come. We continue to focus on initiatives to drive the top-line while making significant progress to drive improvements to our operating and cash flow margins. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for Q&A. Dave?\nA - Dave Gennarelli: Thanks, Brett. I see that there are quite a few hands raised already, so I'll take them in order. And in the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question so that we can get to everyone, and then you're welcome to queue back up for additional questions. And with that, we'll go to Brian Essex at JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you, and thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll start off with the easy one, and that's the preliminary fiscal '25 outlook. And I just want to ask you in the context of, I guess, taking into consideration two issues in particular. One would be the impact, as you guys alluded to of the most recent breach on your pipeline, close rates, customer relationships. And the other would be, I guess, the need for you to improve your relationship with channel partners in order to drive better growth. So, with regard to that preliminary outlook, how should we think about assumptions baked into that outlook, particularly as it relates to traction or churn with customers and contribution from partners considering these issues? And where in the spectrum of guidance being [\"kitchen-sinked\"] (ph) can we consider this forecast to be?\nTodd McKinnon: Hey, Brian, thanks for the question, and thanks for jumping on the release this morning early before the market. That was a little bit atypical given the situations of the customer advisory, but we appreciate you covering and everyone else that covered it as well. We know it's extra something you weren't planning for us. We appreciate it. I'll comment just on the business strategy behind the guidance first of all, I think that might be helpful. The -- we have -- it's very important and it's very clear to everyone at Okta that security is the top priority. We've prioritized securities at some level over the years. And it's been balanced with other priorities, growth, new product development and various things to run the business. And those efforts, I'm simplifying a little bit, but often have gone into product security, infrastructure, making sure that was very, very solid. And we know now that we -- that's not good enough. We have to do more. We know that Okta is one of the most targeted companies in the world because of the leadership position we have in this important market of identity access management, and that makes us, along with other cybersecurity companies, extremely targeted and relentlessly attacked. And we have to raise our game to be able to defend ourselves and our customers against those attacks. So, we're really upping the level of priority, and it's very clear to everyone at Okta that for the end of this year and going into next year, that the number one priority is securing Okta and securing our customers, full stop. And everything else is prioritized after that. And the second most -- the number two priority is after security is growth and profitable growth -- profitably growing the business. And I think you see that reflected in the business strategy in terms of the direction we're giving teams. We have a 90-day all hands on deck in terms of focusing on bottoms-up ideas and security efforts across the company, getting help from outside industry experts, tops down to bolster our own experts. We've done this in various degrees over the years, but we're really aggressively doing more of this to get all the best minds and best input on these opportunities and problems for us. We're making sure that it's not just of one year or one quarter change. It's really a continued accelerated evolution of our cultural change to really being -- having the culture of one of the most secure companies in the world. Remember, Okta started as a -- it was -- our focus was enabling technology and making it easy to adopt the cloud. It wasn't necessarily started 15 years ago as a cyber company. Now that changed a few years into the company, and it's very clear to us now that -- and has been for the last few years that the bar is the most secure company in the world, full stop. And so that's the number one priority, and that's what we're focused on. And then part of that, of course, is kind of the last pillar that we're really focused on now, which is making sure the products themselves as customers use them, the actual security use cases on those products are prioritized incredibly highly. A great example of that is making sure that when we think about managing access to privileged resources, we -- with our new privileged access management product, making sure we prioritize and make it work great with our own Okta administration console, because attackers are going after that because that's such a valuable target. So, it's a wholesale clear communication to customers and to employees and to partners and investors that security is the top priority, full stop. And we will stop at nothing to make sure we become one of the most secure companies of the world because it's kind of clear to everyone that we're short of where we need to be now and we will fix that.\nBrett Tighe: And I'll just add a couple of comments there, Brian. Thanks for -- one, nice to see you. Thanks for the question. But in terms of the guidance philosophy, really no difference from what we've done before. I think we all know, for years now, we give this early look. It's a prudent look. We've got five quarters ago. We've got a big Q4 ahead of us. And so, we're factoring in two major factors, like I said a few minutes ago, which is around the macro and then also around the security incident and making sure we're being prudent about the guidance at this point given how far out we are from the end of FY '25.\nTodd McKinnon: No, you asked the question, too, Brian about the channel partners.\nBrian Essex: Yes.\nTodd McKinnon: I think that's -- I would say that's continued thread and a continuation of what we've been doing this year with our enhanced partner program and clarifying the partners we're working with and investing on the ones that are really moving the needles, the things you've heard us talk about in previous calls, that's an ongoing thing, and we're continuing to execute on that and seeing benefits from that in the business.\nBrian Essex: Do you have the pipeline internally to hit that number without incremental improvement in partner contribution? Or how confident you're with that 10%...\nTodd McKinnon: We're very happy with where the pipeline is.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, we're confident in what we've given you guys today. Like I said, no change in the guidance philosophy.\nBrian Essex: Okay. Thank you.\nBrett Tighe: No problem.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Rob Owens at Piper.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the transparency and disclosure around the breach and realizing these things can take on a life of their own as time passes. But I was curious more so what you're doing for customers to assuage concerns around the breach itself aside from pushing out some launch dates here? And any proactive steps that you're taking to help future retention? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. I've been -- I've had many, many conversations with customers over the last few weeks, as you can imagine. And the reactions vary. Some are from, thanks for the update, we appreciate the communication, to the other extreme, which is a lot of frustration and concern. The common thread or the common theme is that we're incredibly important to our customers, and they're relying on us for their critical infrastructure of their customer identity or their workforce identity. So, it really matters. And the first thing they want to know is that do we know how important this is? And are we taking these things seriously? Do we have the right plan in place to react to these things and get better going forward? And when I talk to them, the themes that resonate are really clear priority, comprehensive look at all the threats and all the opportunities across product and infrastructure, making sure the cultural tone from the top is set appropriately, and I can do that in a way no one else in the company can do. So, I'm very clear about that. And then the last thing I talked about before is how the products can help them be more secure because this all is about the foundation for their security. And once that foundation is solid, then they can use our products to be -- to further enhance their own security. So, I think to your specific question about what we're doing specifically, I think it's -- part of it is being open and transparent. One of the reasons why we thought this most recent disclosure to the one we did yesterday and then publicly this morning is that when we talk to customers, the number one thing they want is transparency. And they want to know as soon as possible, what is the risk increase? What are the threats? And our commitment as on our journey to be one of the most secure companies in the world is to make sure we fulfill that commitment and make sure we're open and transparent and disclose all the information we have. So, I know it seems a little strange right now. But in some ways, what we did yesterday and today are executing on this plan and this commitment we've made to them. And then, I think there's many more things we can do in terms of just making sure customers understand what happened and what we're doing about it, and you'll see us do more about these in -- toward these communication efforts going forward. But at the end of the day, I was talking to -- I have -- I was talking -- one of my conversations was with a CISO of a large manufacturing company that's been heavily adopted on Okta, and this is common to how these things go. He said, \"Todd, this -- you are -- the position you are in the ecosystem, in the industry, you are one of the most attacked and focused on from an adversarial perspective companies in the world. And we know that if you take this as seriously as you're saying you do and you have these plans and these priorities in place to improve your -- make sure you're one of the most secure companies in the world, that's going to be more than enough for what we need because you're going to be attacked way more than we ever will.\" And so, I think they see it as -- once we communicate the details, once they can understand our plans and our priority and our focus, they come away with more comfort. But again, at the end of the day, what they really want is no issues like this, and that's ultimately our goal to try to prevent these whenever possible.\nRob Owens: Thanks for the color, Todd.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Adam Tindle at Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Thanks, Dave. Hey Todd, I wanted to ask a little bit more about the renewal process in light of the security incident. Brett mentioned that contract duration continues to shorten. So, the thought would be the renewal process is likely happening more frequently moving forward. I wonder what kind of processes you have in place to retain customers. And any ideas that Jon brings to the CRO role to this process? And Brett, if you could just touch on the assumptions on gross retention and NRR embedded? I know you're factoring in the security incident, but I would imagine that's where it's going to hit the most, so that would be really helpful to understand what the assumptions embedded are? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: The renewals process and execution of that is something where it's a very mature part of the company and we're very good at it. I think it leads to -- as we've talked about several times, the gross retention in the mid-90%s is a healthy level. And it's -- so it's a strong muscle we have. Contract durations, as Brett mentioned, have been shortening. I think it's -- they're still on average, two-and-a-half years. And the reason they're shortening is this started happening during some of the more economic slowdowns last year. It's just -- I think across the board, people are not signing up for as much as they in terms of length of subscription as they wanted to. So, I think that the renewals conversation will continue to be addressed effectively by our existing motion that we don't need some kind of new motion or start a new conversation. I think it comes down to making sure that the adoption of the product is high, which we're very good at getting our products adopted and making sure that the value is being delivered and that the price they're being charged for is fair. So, there'll definitely be some as we just communicate to customers about our prioritization of security and our focus on it and our execution across that plan, that'll be funneled down to the renewals team as well. But I don't see any big changes to the overall renewal motion because of this.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah, I can also add on to that, Adam. Thank you for the question. So, first on the contract duration, just to be clear, there's been a general shortening of contracts to what Todd was talking about. But part of the reason is actually the success we've had in public sector, which typically is only a one-year contract. So that business is doing well is going to put a headwind on our contract duration. So, I guess that's a good issue to have in terms of contract duration. So, in terms of what we baked into the guidance for specifically NRR, net retention rate or gross retention rate in FY '25, we haven't gotten to that level of detail because -- given we're so early in the planning process. But what I would say is we do believe both the macro puts a headwind on growth and also the security incident. And so, where each of them comes through, I mean, macro, we've talked about new business seed expansions being impacted there. From the security incident perspective, we think growth is impacted. I can't give you exactly is it more upsell or is it more gross retention in terms of FY '25. But what I can tell you is, terms of FY '24, like we've talked about in the past, we did expect that number to tick down. Net retention is going to tick down throughout the balance of this fiscal year. And we had a nice quarter in Q3, 115%, flat with Q2. So, we do still expect it to drop in Q4 based on those macro headwinds we've talked about with seed expansions. But that hopefully helps you with a little bit more detail on how we're thinking about FY '25 as well as our net retention rate in the very near term next quarter.\nDave Gennarelli: Next, we'll go to Rudy Kessinger at D.A. Davidson.\nRudy Kessinger: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and appreciate the candor as it relates to the breach. Todd, at Oktane, it seemed pretty clear that you were hinting that you guys were close to hiring a new President of Worldwide Field Operations or Head of Sales, and today, I know you're closing that search, you're moving Jon into the permanent role. So, I guess I just a couple of clarifications. Did the breach impact your ability to land a new Head of Sales at all? And secondly, just understanding the current structure, is Jon going to be taking on both the Head of Sales and Chief Revenue Officer roles or will you be remaining, I guess, the Head of Sales for the time being?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, thanks for asking for clarification. On the previous question, I forgot to answer the part about Jon. The decision for the go-to-market structure was finalized before October 20. So, it was finalized in early October. So, it had no -- nothing to do with the security incident. The -- I think there were -- since the search started in January of this year, late January, the timeline on it was we were going to make a decision to finalize things by October, and we hit our timeline. So, we didn't want to have an interim structure going into planning for FY '25. So, the goal is to finish it by the end of October. I can't remember exactly the order of operations in terms of when the final decision was made versus when I made those comments. But what I knew at the time for sure is that we were going to finalize one of our finalist candidates and Jon being one of those finalist candidates. We were going to finalize it soon and be ready to roll in our original schedule, which was, like I said, to wrap it up in October. The decision came down to a few things. One is that the -- I think that Jon is -- I talked to dozens and dozens of candidates and interviewed and looked everywhere and different levels of experience and backgrounds, and every person I talk to, the person doing the job was outperforming them. Jon was doing a great job. I was with them in customer meetings around the world. I was, more importantly, talking about strategy going forward and understanding his strategic vision and his familiarity with the market and areas around the world and with the product segments and the identity industry, and he would just really shine brightly, it's like the nine-month job interview. And it really -- he kind of made it hard for other candidates to compare. And I think -- so once I made the decision that he was the right guy to be the Chief Revenue Officer, I also made the decision that I really like the current structure of business operations under Eugenio as the President of Business Operations -- Global Business Operations. The marketing function under one of our strongest operational executives, Eric Kelleher and then Jon running sales and pre-sales and partners reporting directly to me. So basically, the flatter organizational structure where I have direct -- the business operations, customer success, our customer -- Chief Customer Officer, Marketing, and then Chief Revenue reporting directly to me, it was the best thing for us going forward. So there's really two decisions. It was who's the best Chief Revenue Officer in the world, and then do we need that extra layer of a President. And the best thing for Okta for the future is to finish out the search for President and have these talented capable people in place that drive us forward.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. Let's go to Hamza at Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Todd, on a high level, could you speak to the switching costs of your products? And based on your very early conversations, would you anticipate some customer churn as a result of this incident?\nTodd McKinnon: I think the switching costs vary. And it's -- one of the great things about both the customer identity products and the workforce identity products are that you can -- they're very flexible. You can implement them very quickly and easily. And then, you can also implement them in a way that's quite comprehensive and connected to everything and very complete and cover every technology and every resource in the customer's environment. So, the switching costs vary. I mean there are companies that have a relatively light implementation and the switching costs are pretty low and then there are implementations that are very deep and broad and lots of custom integrations and so forth and the switching costs are higher. So, I think it varies. I don't -- I think there's various reasons why people switch off. And I think it's pretty hard, and it's always in customers that are less likely adopted and have lower switching costs, which is -- seems pretty obvious, but that's true. And I think we're -- we've seen some people switching off various reasons. Sometimes it's like we've said, our gross retention is mid-90%s, but so that means by definition, there's some percentage that are switching off, various reasons for doing that. And I think at the end of the day, it's going to be hard to directly ascribe it to one thing. So I think we're just trying to make customers successful and provide huge value in the products. And our strategy of a converged platform on the workforce side and covering every identity use case with customer and workforce. And we have, I think, prudent assumptions in the forward guide about what is baking in security incident or baking in macro. We're comfortable with that guidance, and we're going to go out there and execute our plan. And I think it's going to be in the long term, we're going to show a lot of success and deliver a lot of value to customers, and that's going to drive success across the board.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: We'll go to Joe Gallo at Jefferies.\nJoe Gallo: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Impressive margin performance this quarter and guidance next year. Can you just further unpack the drivers of leverage there? And then just talk through whether that inhibits the growth algo at all? And then, just maybe whether -- how you think about longer-term growth? Do these margins kind of reflect a new reality of potentially a lower long-term sustainable growth? Thanks.\nBrett Tighe: Thanks, Joe, nice to see you. So, in terms of the -- how we're achieving this, this is really something we've been working on for probably about 18 months at this point. And if you remember, last year, we started this cost structure, efficiency, whether it be from moving headcount to lower-cost regions or rationalizing software, rationalizing real estate. It's been a long-time effort for us to be able to really set up the structure to be able to deliver these types of margins. I'm really excited that actually we can talk about Rule of 40 this year because that's how we look at the business and manage the business and kind of think about it from the lens of growth versus profitability. But ultimately, all this hard work is allowing us to offer up and guide with confidence these margins that you see in the FY '25 guidance, 17% non-GAAP operating margin, at least 19% free cash flow margin. And so that's a really good shift for us. We've set up that structure to be able to drive that efficiency, drive the leverage in the business. And as far as growth versus margin, we're always going to balance the two. And ultimately look to balance the two. So I can't give you anything beyond FY '25, but we're always going to manage the business through that lens of the Rule of 40, something we're very proud of that we feel we can achieve this year, and we'll always target as we as we move forward into FY '25 and beyond. It's something we really kind of pride ourselves on doing overall.\nJoe Gallo: Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, we're actually going to go to Madeline Brooks at BofA. She got knocked out of the queue. I'm putting her back in the spot here.\nMadeline Brooks: Thanks so much, Dave. Appreciate it. And just appreciate the transparency of your remarks. I know many people have said that, but just really want to emphasize that. So the question is, you know, if I look at what happened this quarter, my quick math implies that roughly 99% of net new cRPO came from the existing base. And it's a two-parter. Across peers, these numbers begin to kind of turn positive, again, with contributions from net new customers increasing post-macro. So, the first part is why do you think the trend in your numbers is different than other cyber peers? And the second part is, is there any concern heading into next year, the existing customer base will already be saturated, leaving less room for upside, especially with this 90-day push out of new products and the potential headwind from the new bids given the recent security event?\nBrett Tighe: Sorry, Madeline, you broke up a little bit on me, but I think you were saying the mix on cRPO was related more to upsell versus new business, is that...\nTodd McKinnon: She said she calculated 90% of the cRPO came from existing customers.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I can't say that I have that number at hand, Madeline, but what I will say is, as we've talked about in the past, our mix of business has shifted more toward upsells. We believe that's related directly to the macro side of the house, really putting pressure on new business. And so, I think that's why you're seeing those numbers. I think we had a nice quarter from a new customer adds. Net adds was up 400. You heard Todd talk about the $1 million customers. Greater than $100,000 customers had a nice addition as well, an increase sequentially versus Q2. So, we do see new business helping us out, but we do see a headwind there due to the macro headwinds that although have stabilized, still are headwind to our growth in the business.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. And one thing I can add there, hopefully, it's helpful, is the new products. We have with -- we have three amazing products to sell our existing customers. I mean, some customers have customer identity, but we still have a lot of customers to sell our customer identity to. And then we have many, many customers to sell Okta Identity Governance too. That thing is just starting to roll. It's had some early success, but it's been GA a little over a year now, starting to get a ton of traction. We had a couple of really important deals with the one I mentioned in my comments that we posted at the site was a global pharmaceutical company had a big OIG upsell and then the new GA of PAM. So, I don't -- I think we have a ton of new products from the pipeline to sell our customers and that's what we're making sure we operationalize those newer products and execute well in selling those. And I think the 90-day delay on some of the new products could potentially be impactful at some point, but we're not short of products for FY '24 for sure -- sorry, FY '25 for sure.\nMadeline Brooks: Got it. Thanks so much.\nDave Gennarelli: Yeah, let's go to Eric Heath at KeyBanc.\nEric Heath: Hey, Dave, thank you. So, Todd, it's great to see PAM is getting rolled out this week. I guess kind of two parts to the PAM opportunity. So, one, just what learnings can you draw from OIG to relay that into some similar early success into PAM, number one? And then, number two, just given PAM can be used to protect the customers Okta environment, is this something that you could potentially make available to customers at no extra charge just as it relates to protecting their own Okta environment?\nTodd McKinnon: I think there's -- we're really excited about privileged access. And I think the biggest -- I think there's a couple of lessons from OIG that are just, I would call them independent of any product area. So just new product introductions across the board, things like best practices to when to enable broadly, when do enable different segments of the market. Like one of the learnings from OIG was that it's having much more success in larger enterprises than we expected. And so, I think we'll roll that learning to PAM and will enable the larger enterprise sellers sooner than we did with OIG, because we anticipate that it could have the same phenomenon and exceed our expectations in larger enterprise. Another interesting phenomenon from OIG was that OIG is exceeding our expectations in kind of, call them, brownfield environments where they already have an existing governance solution. So, we'll bring those learnings to the PAM product as well. On the product direction, one area that is through the early access phase and now that we move into GA, one of the learnings on the product directions is that customers -- the product's main focus has been through the early limited -- sorry, through the early access has been on servers, so Linux and Windows servers, Kubernetes clusters, managing access to these things, these kind of infrastructure-type resources. Customers find a lot of value in having us manage the privileged accounts in SaaS apps. So, we're connected to Salesforce. We're connected to Workday. We're connected to GitHub, manage the privileged accounts in there. So that's an exciting direction. As you mentioned, what is one of the most critical privileged account systems in the world, it's Okta admin console. So, we're exploring ideas to better integrate that, and that's going to be a big focus. And your idea about offering it for free to every Okta customer is a very interesting one, and this might be the first time ever I've taken product input on an earnings call, but I do take it.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. Next, let's go to Gray Powell at BTIG.\nGray Powell: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So yeah, I guess, kind of a modeling question here. Normally, I would expect sequential growth in cRPO in Q3 to be at a similar level to that of what you've seen in Q2. At least that's what you've seen the last couple of years. This year, you added $54 million in net new cRPO. Last quarter, you added $71 million. So I know this is kind of rough, but like is it safe to say that the main difference there was the breach happening with like 10 or 11 days left in the quarter and then customers just taking a pause? Or is there something else that I should be thinking of? And then, the other part of the question would be, as we think of Q4 trends, like how much of a hangover is there? How much should we expect the lingering impact of the breach to be on conversations with customers?\nBrett Tighe: Yeah. Thanks, Gray. Som from a sequential perspective, I think I wouldn't do that math in terms of backing into the impact associated with the incident. I would more think about renewals timing, that can have a heavy impact on cRPO quarter-to-quarter. So, we feel we had a really nice quarter in terms growing 16%, $1.83 billion in current RPO. So, I wouldn't read too much detail into that. In terms of Q4, all of it's baked in, all of what we think the potential impact is associated with the security incident, that is in the guidance that we've given you here today, 11% to 12% and $1.88 billion at the top-end of the range. So that's kind of how we think about things.\nGray Powell: All right, fair enough. Thank you.\nBrett Tighe: No problem\nDave Gennarelli: We'll go to Peter Weed at Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. It looks like the change in your anticipated growth in quarter four came down relative to what you implied last quarter by almost 3 percentage points. And I think you've said that this is the impact of the outage. Is that experiential? In other words, like there are some things that you've already seen occur that are leading you to believe that you will definitely see that? And is that turning up in customers that are kind of showing that they're going to leave? Is it people are failing to upgrade at the pace that they have been before? Is that it's harder to win new customers? You anticipate -- you had a really nice quarter actually, getting new customers, sequentially up. Do you anticipate that to take a dive? I'm trying to figure out like where that shows up kind of in the stack of where you would have normally thought that kind of sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, that seems to have been kind of eliminated as a result of the outage -- not the outage...\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, the incident. So, if you look at every quarter, Peter, there's always deals that push from quarter-to-quarter. It's just a natural part of our business. We saw an elevated level of that, and we ascribe that potentially could be related to the security incident. So, we're taking that into our guidance when we think about Q4 and thinking about it from a prudent perspective, especially given how big the number can be in Q4 and setting the trajectory for fiscal year '25. So that's how we're thinking about things.\nPeter Weed: So it's actually more just, there are deals that stayed in the pipeline, but you just anticipate they may push out of this quarter into the next quarter...\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. I mean we did see...\nPeter Weed: [indiscernible] already from Q3 into Q4, wouldn't that like give you deals that would be closing in this quarter that should plug some of that gap. So, you'd have to really push out a lot of deals out of Q4 and to Q1 at that point.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah. You're right, we actually have already seen some of those deals close in Q4, which is a good sign, but we're being prudent given the environment out there today, given both the macro and the impact associated with the security incidents. So, we're just being thoughtful.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. I mean if you think about the chronology of it, it's 11 days left in the quarter and then we're only just a month into the fourth quarter. So, in terms of the window to see the impact, we're a little bit limited on a window to see the impact. So I think that drives some of the pragmatism in the guide.\nDave Gennarelli: All right. Let's go to Adam Borg at Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe a bigger picture question here. So, international is still about 20%, 21% of the mix. And just given the size of the company, it just seems like there is a lot of international opportunity ahead. So just as you think about the channel investments and you think about the new CRO and CMO in place, what are the thoughts about kind of accelerating opportunity in the international theater to potentially help accelerate growth? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: I think it's a big opportunity. I do think from a macro perspective in terms of the stabilized macro but still a challenging macro. I think the macro impact internationally has probably been more pronounced from my observation than in North America over the last year or so. We also have -- in terms of the interim to permanent CRO with Jon, that also gives us the opportunity to backfill Jon as the General Manager of Europe, and we have some candidates in the late-stage pipeline for that. So that's more leadership stability internationally. Couple that with a great leadership team in Asia Pacific, which is performing well, you have a really good opportunity for solid performance internationally, which is -- has to be an important part of our future. If you just look at the numbers, the market is -- half the market is probably outside the U.S. over time in terms of identity management, we're using rough numbers. And over the next five to 10 years, we're going to make sure we get that mix higher than it is now in terms of a percentage of revenue.\nBrett Tighe: I'd also add, just Jon, being an international person himself, like he brings that lens, right? And so, we're really excited about that and the opportunity out in front of us. Because I agree with Todd, we've got a lot of opportunity internationally.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. Next up is Matt Hedberg at RBC.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Todd, a product question. In your prepared remarks, you noted you're pleasantly surprised, I think, by the size of organizations adopting your identity governance products. I think a year ago, it probably would have surprised a lot of us. I think we would have thought maybe some of the traction would have been from smaller organizations or midsized organizations. So, I guess maybe why the success up market, do you think at this point? And then Brett, when you think about the impact to -- from governance in your '25 outlook, I assume you're taking a very modest approach, but just thoughts on how you're thinking about that product next year?\nTodd McKinnon: The -- I just think that large organizations have -- there's a lot of complexity. And I think maybe we underestimated the ability -- I think we looked at some of these larger organizations and what they were doing with the existing governance solutions, and we assume that they were -- these solutions were covering the SAPs, the Oracle apps, the legacy apps and assuming that they would also be covering all the cloud stuff and all the new stuff, I think that assumption is just proving to be maybe not as accurate as we thought. I think a lot of these legacy products aren't covering where the center of gravity is moving, which is cloud-centric application workloads and cloud infrastructure. And so, the product is a better fit for these large companies than we thought. I think also just our overall the last, call it, five or six quarters when the macro environment changed, you're just seeing more success for Okta in the bigger companies. So I think it's -- I think OIG has a big future in mid enterprise and SMB. But I think that segment is just the slower segment right now. So, we're not seeing the attaches with OIG there that we could over time. So, I think it looks better because more people are -- have the problem and finding value from it in a large enterprise, and also large enterprise is just doing so well with 40% growth in that cohort, both in ACV of those deals and customer account of those deals in Q3. So, I think attaching OIG, there's more opportunities to attach there relative to the entire business. So, I think that's influencing the perception as well.\nBrett Tighe: Yeah. And I would add, although we're very excited about the progress so far, Matt, I mean, yes, we are being modest with our expectations in the guidance we've given you here today. One thing that I know you guys have asked in the past is how much -- and we've told you, we keep telling we're going to update every time we get a new number. But that third of workforce spend being IGA continues to hold steady through the end of Q3. So that's the number we've given you in the past, and it continues to be that. So, the upsell associated with it is significant, and we're very pleased with how things are going, just like Todd said.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. Next up, Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. With regards to the breach, can you give us a little bit more detail on maybe what's still left in the third-party validation and investigation? And how confident are you that this is going to be the last finding that comes out of this investigation? Thank you.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, it's a great question, Jonathan. In my many, many conversations with customers, this comes up like speed of disclosure and they want to know all the information as fast as possible, and why does disclosure take time and what else is left to disclose, et cetera. So it is on everyone's mind, obviously. I think the general philosophy we're taking is that we're trying to disclose as much as we know as quickly as possible. I think a couple of weeks after the incident, when we had our first disclosure, we disclosed everything we knew at the time. And we just kept looking like you're talking about the log files from our support system. We're quite voluminous, and the team went over them click-by-click, row-by-row, line-by-line, kind of took first pass and looked at all the things they thought were incredibly sensitive and took a quick run of some of these reports and found it wasn't much interesting data and then published the first RCA and remediation steps and then like a good security company would kept looking and kept digging and made sure we had everything covered and frowned more. And we were more thorough about these reports and ran completely and saw the data was there and made the decision to do a further disclosure based on risk of phishing like we've outlined. And so, I think the way I characterize it is now our internal team has gone over it many, many times, and our internal investigation is done. Like we don't think there's anything else productively we can look at. We've worked with the vendor and got supplemental logs. We've combed through it. We've done everything three, four, five times to check it. But we still want to make sure we cover all the bases, so we brought on this firm that has started a couple of weeks ago, and they're looking at it. I think we're doing it, obviously, to be very thorough and clear. I think it's a relatively low priority that they'll find anything additionally, but we'll have to wait and see in mid-December when they were done with their analysis.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. I'd like to welcome back Fatima Boolani from Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you. I appreciate the question. Todd, you were very categorical about securing Okta. So, your customers are secure as being the number one priority. So the question for you is, is that people, process or technology or maybe all of the above conversation? And then maybe to Brett, it's not immediately apparent in your margin guidance that you're going to be taking in making these investments. So can you just sort of help us understand and kind of what envelope a lot of this up-leveling and reinforcing of your internal security architecture, what shape or form is that going to take?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. It's a super insightful question, Fatima. And as you guessed, it's all of the above. And I think we -- the program internally is called program Bedrock, building the Bedrock foundation. And it has four pillars, I'll call them pillars. The first one is, there's just bottoms-up, get all the ideas on the table of everything we know that the team thinks would be great ideas to make us the most secure company in the world. And like a good example of something from this pillar is like this thing that we're advising customers to do with the latest notification around having MFA for all administrator accounts, that really should be required. There shouldn't be an option to not. Again, over the years, we, in some cases, made the choice for convenience and speed of implementation or frictionless adoption instead of security. But as we march toward being the most -- or one of the most secure companies in the world, that's going to change. So we have to make that required and you got to work through that because there's a reason sometimes customers don't have MFA required, maybe it's a service account, maybe there's a specific workflow. But everyone, as we do this bottoms-up effort, it's like a lot of good ideas on how we can make that better. And that whole bucket of bottoms up, we have a lot of awesome smart people on the team that have the time and space now to let those ideas come out and they're going to -- we're going to have time and space to implement them as well. So that's the bottoms-up track. The second track is really, call it, tops-down, which is making sure from an internal security architecture perspective, specifically in overall business operations and IT operations as inclusive of obviously product and infrastructure, but getting the top experts in the world and to give us their opinion on how we should be architecting our -- this part of our security posture and architecture. And there's people that do this for the most secure companies in the world, and we want to take those experts and combine them with our experts internally to make sure we have the best security blueprint from an architectural perspective. So, we have bottoms-up, we have tops-down. And then the third pillar is really cultural. And that starts with me and the leadership team in setting this clear priority and setting the expectation that we are going to be the most -- our goal is to be one of the most secure companies in the world, and we're going to prioritize that, number one. When you think about executing well, it can be pretty straightforward. It's like you have to make sure you have a clear vision. We want to be one of the most secure companies in the world. We want -- you've got to set clear priority and get the right amount of resources on it. And that kind of sets up this cultural component to be successful. And then the last one is, I think I mentioned before, is in the product. We have to make sure that the products themselves are beyond just being valuable and powerful for our customers. They have to be built in a way that ensures the security of our customers as well. And the best example for this is after the notification of this incident in October, we quickly implemented this feature, which actually cryptographically binds an administrator console session to a specific network. So, this is the kind of thing that is very valuable for customers and keep them secure. And as we think about it more and go through the entire product architecture and overview, there's many more of these things that can put us closer to being from a product perspective and products that protect our customers and their use of it and their deployments of it, the most secure company in the world, and that's the fourth pillar. So, it's quite comprehensive. I think the 90-day focus gives everyone space and clarity to have no confusion about this being the priority. And I think after 90 days, what you'll see is, obviously, these kind of efforts have -- they've been going on in some shape or form for many years, and they will continue after this 90 days. But right now, we just need this real clear alignment on getting ourselves closer to that goal of being the most secure company in the world.\nFatima Boolani: I appreciate that. Thank you, Todd.\nBrett Tighe: And then, for the second part of your question, Fatima, it's really, there's two things. One, we're already investing a good amount in FY '24. So, to step up in the margins, not like we're starting at zero. So, we're investing a good amount right now. We're going to invest more in Q4. But this is one of the benefits of the structural efficiencies that we found and driven over the last 12 to 18 months. It allows us to expand the non-GAAP operating margin from 13% to 17%, while also investing more into these critical areas like security. And so, we've invested a lot already, but we're going to invest even more in FY '25, but while also being able to balance it with the margin that you mentioned. So, it's one of those benefits of us to we've been working so hard on for last 12 to 18 months.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you, Brett.\nBrett Tighe: No problem.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. We're going to try to get to a couple more. Let's go to Josh Tilton at Wolfe Research.\nJosh Tilton: Hey guys, can you hear me?\nTodd McKinnon: Loud and clear, Josh.\nJosh Tilton: All right, great. I wanted to clarify a previous question. Does the guidance for Q4 embed some conservatism around the recent incident because you are anticipating to see something or because you are already seeing an impact? And then just a follow-up is, Todd, you mentioned that you spoke to customers and they kind of understand why as an identity provider, you guys are being targeted by hackers so much. Is that raising any questions from the customer base as to whether or not it makes sense to go all in with all of your identity needs from one provider? Or given that you guys are the center of the security ecosystem and the number one target for hackers, does it maybe make sense to diversify some of your identity risk across a different PAM vendor and a different governance provider?\nBrett Tighe: Hey, Josh, I'll take the first part. So anticipating is the answer -- short answer since we're running out of time because we did see, like I said earlier, an elevated amount of pushes or deal pushes from Q3 into Q4. And so we're just anticipating that as we go through the quarter because as a reminder to everybody, we do not have a linear bookings quarter. It is very back-end weighted. And so, we're just taking into account what we saw at the end of Q3 and looking and making sure we had put that into our expectations for Q4.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. And on the question on the -- getting everything from one vendor versus spreading out your risk with different vendors, I think it comes down to at the actual physical layer of how the products are implemented, how you mitigate that risk of getting everything from one vendor. And then the second thing is the product, there has to be a lot of value in getting it from one vendor like in terms of decreasing risk, the operational simplicity, the power of how you can secure things because things are better integrated. So that's the equation. In fact, I was having this exact conversation with a customer just a few days ago about the risks and reward of consolidated around one vendor versus the spread things around spread the risk perspective. And I think that's -- those are the variables in the equation that people think about.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to John DiFucci at Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks, Dave. So Todd, my question is a follow-up to Fatima's question. I got to remember to try to get ahead of her because she -- it's hard to follow her, but I thought that was a really good question. And thank you for all the detail you gave around that, the program Bedrock. But in the end, still like, how long is it going to take to get to, as you say, raise your game to get to a point of, I don't know, you're never going to be comfortable, but relative comfort when you can actually sit down with the customer and tell them that you're there. You're never quite there, but you're there don't -- listen, we worry about it every day. We don't want this to happen ever again. That's not to say it never will. But how long do you get to a point where you have that relative comfort through that?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, it's a super -- smart question -- supersmart question. I think I would add color this way. This has been something we've been very focused on for several years, particularly since Lapsus$ breach a couple of years ago. We've been very focused on it. And actually made quite a bit of progress to make us feel comfortable about our progress towards being one of the most secure companies in the world. I think the reason for the 90-day sprint and focus are there is a calculation of -- I and the management team think that there are enough things that will decrease the risk at a significant level, not that the risk is incredibly high, but there's enough things that will decrease the risk at a significant level that we think it's worth a sprint here. But probably more importantly, John, it's kind of cultural. Execution requires clear priority, and nothing makes the priority clear for everyone than a full focus in a 90-day sprint. So beyond the decrease in risk and get closer to this areas you describe it where we feel real comfortable as we progress towards being one of the most secure companies in the world, there is just a cultural tone setting thing, which I think is very important for customers and for investors and for employees as well.\nJohn DiFucci: So it's the 90 days and then just keep going...\nTodd McKinnon: It's not like we've never been focused on security, because we've absolutely had a huge focus on it. Like I said, very, very specific and mature in the areas of the product and the infrastructure. I think we're not as mature and we haven't had the comprehensive approach on the overall IT operations and overall company operations. But it's something we've been doing for a long time and we're going to have the sprint and then we'll keep doing for a long time after because we have to be -- like I've said it many times, we have to be one of the most secure companies in the world given the position we're playing in the critical role we fill for our customers. And that's what they expect from us and that's what we expect from ourselves as well.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you very much. And listen, I just have to add one last thing, something I never say. Actually, I think you guys did a good job. I mean this quarter numbers look good and then even some -- given everything that's going on, I guess, nice job.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, I appreciate it. A lot of hard work from the team.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. And now we're going into overtime here. We're going to take Fred and then Shrenik and we're going to have to cut it off at that point. But Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie, go ahead.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you. I think many good questions have been asked. So I think, Todd, what I'd like to ask is, as we from the outside are looking at what you were doing at Okta, what sort of concrete checkpoints might we expect to see to understand what progress you're making here towards improving your overall security posture, understanding also that no news is kind of good news with respect to data breaches? And secondly, on that one, with the upcoming SEC disclosure timeframe requirements, do you feel that you have the reporting frameworks in place to comfortably meet all of those requirements?\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah. On the second question, I feel really good about that. The disclosure frameworks and so forth, something we -- I think in some ways, we're -- the role we play in the industry and the tone and the transparency we're trying to set with customers, we have a lot of things in place that put us in good standing there in terms of our ability to execute on those disclosures. The first question you asked is I think there's -- we have a really good answer on the product visible things. We're going to be reporting those out like as we would do product releases or feature capabilities. These -- like the two examples I mentioned are the network binding for session tokens and the required MFA, that's going to be published. And so, you'll see the roadmap for those things, and you'll see that thing published publicly into customers. I think the internal stuff, the things that the team comes up with in terms of improving our operational security and comprehensive look at the security and taking in outside experts, we have to think more about how to communicate that broadly to customers. But I think it's just as important because not only is it just give customers confidence in how seriously how aggressively we're taking this, but also it can help them learn because every customer I talk to, they're thinking like, what can we learn from Okta because Okta is on this journey to be one of the most secure companies in the world. I can learn from that. So I think there's value in sharing that not just from the trust perspective, but also from the learning and helping customers through that education.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. Last question to Shrenik Kothari at Baird.\nShrenik Kothari: Hey, yeah, thanks for taking my question, and appreciate the transparency, Todd and Brett. Just to follow up on your point, Todd, on products security focus and customer security focus. In light of the recent hack incident, the role of PAM seem to be elevating and becoming even more kind of broad based. It's great to see that you guys are focused on PAM. As you said, the only product with GAs on track versus other product features, maybe relatively [deprioritized] (ph). Can you elaborate how are you positioning PAM in your customer conversations? More importantly, how are customers responding? And how is the customer feedback evolving given post this hack incident on one hand, of course, everybody knows PAM is going to be a key piece of puzzle in this threat landscape while the incident perhaps leading to customer perception of perhaps not adequate implementation of core PAM solutions within your internal environments on the other hand. So, if you can provide your thoughts there?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. No, it's a good -- I think every specific incident is different in PAM and the definition of PAM addresses some of them better than others. So I won't comment specifically on this recent incident and what our PAM product does or doesn't do. But broadly speaking, what you're saying is right. All of these attacks, whether it's -- highlighting the need for very strong phishing resistant access management, identity governance and then privileged access management and control. And I think the reception that we've seen with customers is basically, it's very simple. Our positioning is very simple. It's like you're using Okta to manage the user life cycle and the access for many business applications, you should use the same engine and the same access control for your privilege servers and containers. And as I mentioned earlier, in the future release coming relatively quickly for your SaaS applications and for the Okta admin console itself. So that's the pitch. And what customers like is that they get this comprehensive integrated workflow across all of the access points they're trying to secure, whether that's servers, apps, business applications, different kinds of applications, and that's what resonates. And then they can report that back to their auditor and they get complete visibility from a governance risk and compliance assessment and that's the value prop for them. So, it is -- the market we serve and the opportunity for our products is only getting bigger and bigger and the threat landscape is part of that. There's many other drivers of the market size we're going after. And it's one of the reasons why we're so optimistic and bullish about the long-term future given all the work and focus we're putting into the products in the company and the team. And it's -- there's some bright and sunny future ahead of us, we're excited about it.\nShrenik Kothari: All right. Thanks, Todd.\nDave Gennarelli: Okay. Thanks, everybody. That's it for today's meeting. If you have any follow-up questions, you can e-mail us at investor@okta.com. Thanks."

In today's meeting, we will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-over-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Todd McKinnon. Todd?\nTodd McKinnon: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Okta continues to build on its position as the leading independent identity partner. Our focus on improving execution and efficiency has delivered solid top-line results, along with significant improvements to operating profit and cash flow. Brett will walk you through more of the financial details and discuss why we believe the macroeconomic environment, while still challenging, has stabilized relative to the last few quarters. I'll now cover some of the highlights and achievements in the quarter that we believe position Okta for long-term success. I'll start with a few notable examples of customer wins and upsells in Q2, which come from a wide range of industries. An exciting new win this quarter was with one of the largest shipping and transportation lines in Europe. As the company sought to move more of its workloads to the cloud, it locked a strong identity solution and struggled with the manual and time-consuming processes. Okta Workforce Identity Cloud, including Okta Identity Governance or OIG, will enable its thousands of employees and partners to seamlessly access the company apps and systems while bolstering its security posture and improving compliance. A Global 100 consumer packaged goods company was an exciting new Okta Customer Identity Cloud win. The company sought a flexible developer-friendly solution that would help improve the experience of their digital customers. The company will be deploying Okta across multiple customer-facing web, mobile, and IoT applications, as well as across different brands. This is a great beginning with a customer that will have massive expansion opportunities over time. Ryder Truck Rentals was an exciting upsell. Ryder has been leveraging Okta Workforce Identity Cloud, including Okta Customer Identity Solution since 2019 to secure access for its employees and business partners. This quarter, Ryder selected Okta Identity Governance to replace its legacy provider for Identity Governance, access request flows, and access certifications. OIG was deployed in just weeks and with the power of Workflows, Ryder will significantly improve the onboarding experience for new employees, while reducing costs. And here is an example of landing a new customer with OIG as the lead product. A leading global provider of Customer Experience Solutions selected OIG for its extensibility and value. OIG will enable the company to streamline lifecycle management, ensure employees have the right level of access to their resources, and leverage the power of Okta's Workflows platform to customize complex identity governance requirements. In all, we added 350 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer base to over 18,400, representing growth of 12%. New customer growth is an area that we believe has been impacted by the macro environment, which results in a sales environment that is more conducive to expanding existing customer relationships. The net customer adds also reflects increasing strength with larger organizations and public sector agencies. We continue to see strong growth with large customers for both Workforce and Customer Identity, and we are proud to work with some of the most important organizations in the world, such as ADT, Mars, and General Services Administration. In Q2, we added 125 customers with $100,000-plus annual contract value or ACV. Our total base of $100,000-plus ACV customers now stands at over 4,200 and grew 19%. Similar to last quarter, our fastest growing cohort was customers with $1 million-plus ACV. In fact, we had a record number of $5 million-plus total contract value deals. And when you look at the total contract value of the top 25 deals in the quarter, the aggregate value was over $100 million. Large organizations have incredibly complex environments that require greater flexibility. Yesterday, we announced Okta for Global 2000, which is the industry's first identity architecture that gives companies the flexibility to choose which business units, processes, and technologies to run centrally and which to decentralize. Flexibility was built into Okta's core architecture from the beginning. Okta for Global 2000 makes it even more flexible with enhanced security controls and ease of use. It's a very powerful competitive differentiator against monolithic platforms that force companies to work only with their technology stack. This solution has already been a critical component of large new and upsell transactions. A great example of this is a long-time Okta customer, NTT Data. Their hub and spoke deployment includes one central engine as the hub that powers the various Okta organizations in NTT Data's Identity Ecosystem. Okta for Global 2000 provides NTT Data with the ability it needs to manage a distributed set of users with separate domains and IT environments. Product innovation has long been core to Okta's success, and this is a banner year for new products. We continue to be enthusiastic about the early customer reception and momentum of Okta Identity Governance. We have been pleasantly surprised at both the size of the organizations purchasing OIG as well as the range of scenarios that OIG has brought on for, from replacing home-grown solutions and competitor displacements, to being deployed alongside an existing identity governance vendor. It's particularly encouraging to see that nearly half of the OIG business booked in Q2 came from customers that hadn't previously purchased Okta Lifecycle Management or Workflows, which were the building blocks of OIG, and we continue to see a significant spend uplift with customers buying OIG as it's typically a third or more of their total Workforce Identity Cloud spend. Another notable OIG customer win was with Grubhub, a long-time Workforce Identity customer. They added both Okta Identity Governance and Advanced Server Access to their product suite, to reduce manual upkeep and bolster security of servers and on-premise applications. We also continue to look forward to the launch of Okta Privileged Access or OPA later this year. Since our update on the Q1 earnings call, OPA has moved from beta into early access. Okta Device Access is another product in early access that we're excited about. This extends Okta's seamless authentication experience to protect the first vulnerable user touch point, the device login. According to the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report, among security incidents associated with misplaced or stolen devices, 60% are desktop or laptop computers. These devices remain the last frontier where access to corporate resources are protected by just a password. This means that sensitive information such as locally store documents, and logged-in applications are at risk. Okta Device Access enable's Identity-powered MFA immediately when the device is powered up and when attempts are made to unlock the device. This has been one of the most highly requested capabilities by our customers in the last year. This is also timely. It's just last month, the White House held MFA modernization event. Organizations desire this technology as an added layer of security, which has an extra benefit, may help reduce their insurance risk premiums. I mentioned NTT earlier as part of Okta for Global 2000 and I'm excited that they're also an early adopter of Okta Device Access, as they continue to build upon their zero trust security strategy. We'll talk more about our products and our roadmap at Oktane, which we're hosting in San Francisco the first week of October. At the event, we'll go into more detail about what we're working on and the biggest area of technology interest in decades, AI. AI is a paradigm shift in technology that has transformative opportunities for identity from stronger security and faster application development to better user experiences and more productive employees. Okta has been utilizing AI for years with machine-learning models for spotting attack patterns and defending customers against threats and we'll have more exciting AI news to share at Oktane. Just like how every company has to be a technology company, I believe every company must have an AI strategy. More companies will be founded on AI. More applications will be developed with AI, and more identities will need to be protected with a modern identity solution like Okta. A great example of this is how Okta's Customer Identity Cloud is being utilized for the massive number of daily log-ins and authentication by OpenAI, which expanded its partnership with Okta again in Q2. And finally, I want to share some bittersweet news. My dear friend and Co-Founder, Frederic Kerrest, will continue to serve as Vice Chairman of Okta's Board of Directors, but will not be returning to Okta in an operational capacity. His contributions to Okta cannot be overstated. Of course, we'll remain highly connected and I'll continue to work closely with Freddy as he provides guidance and helps formulate our strategy from his Board seat, and remains committed to helping Okta achieve our long-term goals. We're all very happy for him and forever grateful for what he's done for Okta. I look forward to my continued partnership with Freddie in the years ahead. To wrap things up, we're pleased with our overall performance in Q2 and the advancements we've made in execution and efficiency. It's always a good reminder that identity is a key building block for zero trust security, digital transformation, cloud adoption projects, and now AI. These trends will continue in any macroeconomic environment as organizations look for ways to become more efficient while strengthening their security posture. We're still very early in what we believe is a massive addressable market and we're positioned to expand on our success because of Okta's independence, neutrality, and ability to deliver a unified platform covering customer identity, access management, governance, and privileged access, all while committing to delivering profitable growth over the long-term. Now, here is Brett to walk you through more of the Q2 financial results and our outlook.\nBrett Tighe: Thanks, Todd, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're pleased with how quickly the actions we've taken to drive efficiency in our cost structure have taken root. As Todd noted, we're achieving these results while investing in our platform and business to fuel our future growth. I'll review our second quarter results and our outlook for Q3 and FY '24, but first I'll start with some commentary on the macro environment. While macro headwinds, including a minor FX headwind to revenue, continued to impact our business. We believe the environment stabilized in Q2. Our view is based upon trends stabilizing or modest sequential improvements in contract duration, average deal size, the split between new business versus upsells, and seat expansion within upsells and renewals. Pipeline build were healthy, but new pipeline continues to be skewed towards upsells. We also experienced further improvement in metrics related to our go-to-market team, including average tenure, ramp in the number of sales reps closing Workforce Identity and Customer Identity deals. While these are all encouraging data points, we believe it's prudent to maintain a cautious near-term outlook. Turning to Q2 results. Total revenue growth for the second quarter was 23%, driven by a 24% increase in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue represented 97% of our total revenue. International revenue grew 18% and represented 21% of our total revenue. Looking at the ACV split between Workforce Identity and Customer Identity. Workforce ACV grew 22% and represented 61% of total ACV. Customer Identity ACV grew 29% and represented 39% of total ACV. Over the long term, we expect the mix to trend towards fifty-fifty with healthy growth in both. RPO or subscription backlog grew 8%. The general shortening of contract term lengths signed over the past several quarters has impacted total RPO growth. However, in Q2, we were pleased to see a modest sequential increase in contract term lengths. Our overall average term length remains just over 2.5 years. Current RPO, which represents subscription backlog we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months grew 18% to $1.77 billion. Turning to retention. Consistent with prior quarters, gross retention rates remained strong in the mid-90% range. Our dollar-based net retention rate for the trailing 12-month period remains strong at 115%, and was driven by both upsell and cross-sell activity. Similar to last quarter, the sequential downtick in the net retention rate was a result of the macro environment, where customers are not expanding seats at the rate they have in recent years. We believe this trend will persist in this environment. I'll reiterate that the net retention rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the mix of new business, renewals, and upsells fluctuates. As I've noted previously, we've experienced a macro-related shift in our business mix to more upsell and cross-sell versus new business. Before turning to expense items and profitability, I'll point out that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results unless otherwise noted. Looking at operating expenses. Total operating expenses for the quarter were lower than expected. The better-than-expected profitability is primarily due to revenue overperformance, and our continued focus on spend efficiency measures. Total headcount at the end of Q2 increased slightly to approximately 5800. Q2 free cash flow was $49 million, yielding a free cash flow margin of 9%. Free cash flow was significantly better than expected driven by billings and strong collections. During the second quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $142 million of our 2025 convertible debt notes and $242 million of our 2026 convertible debt notes. This resulted in a $42 million GAAP-only gain. Over the past two quarters, we've repurchased $750 million of debt, resulting in a $73 million GAAP-only gain. We will continue to regularly evaluate our capital structure and capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong, anchored by $2.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Now, let's turn to our business outlook for Q3 and FY '24, which factors in the current state of the macroeconomic environment. As a reminder, we've taken several actions to reduce our cost structure and increase our efficiency as an organization, which will benefit margins this year and beyond. With that as a backdrop, for the third quarter of fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue of $558 million to $560 million, representing growth of 16%. Current RPO of $1.780 billion to $1.785 billion, representing growth of 13%. Non-GAAP operating income of $53 million to $55 million and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.29 to $0.30, assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 180 million. For FY '24, we are raising our revenue outlook by $30 million at the high end of the range. We now expect $2.207 billion to $2.215 billion, representing growth of 19%. We are raising our outlook for non-GAAP operating income by $50 million to $215 million to $220 million, which yields a non-GAAP operating margin of 10%. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is raised to $1.17 to $1.20, assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 179 million. And we are raising our free cash flow margin outlook for FY '24 to 15% from 12% previously. On a dollar basis, that's a raise of approximately $70 million. Lastly, I want to provide a few comments to help with modeling Okta. We are applying a static 26% non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year. We expect free cash flow margin in the low double-digits in Q3 and to continue to grow into the mid-teens in Q4. To wrap things up, we're optimistic going into the second half of the fiscal year. While the pressures of the macro environment remain, we are confident that we've set the path of profitable growth for years to come. We continue to focus on initiatives to drive the top-line, while making significant progress to drive improvements to our operating and cash flow margins. And finally, we're excited to see everyone at Oktane. In addition to all the great things we'll be talking about on the product side, we'll be hosting an executive panel session for analysts and investors with Todd, myself, and Eugenio Pace, our President of Business Operations. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for Q&A. Dave?\nA - Dave Gennarelli: Thanks, Brett. I see that there is quite a few hands raised already and I'll take them in order. And in the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question so that we can get to everyone. And then, you're welcome to queue back up with additional questions. So, first off, we'll go to Rob Owens at Piper.\nRob Owens: Great, Dave. Thank you, and good afternoon, guys. Was hoping you could talk a little bit, sort of unpack for us the guide and just the sequential change. When you're talking about the macro, you mentioned stability, but still having a level of conservatism. And so, as we see this stability, A, can you help explain just the sequential and the guide; and B, maybe speak to some of the metrics relative to customer count, large customer metrics, when those should turn the quarter, net retention rates, cRPO as well. Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Hey, Rob. We're really happy with the results in the quarter, particularly a couple of the things you mentioned, the large customer momentum. We had -- the top 25 deals were over $100 million of TCV in the quarter, which is super, super strong. We also -- you mentioned the customer counts and it's definitely an area that we think is related to macro. Our customer adds and -- are really influenced by the small business part of our -- part of our -- the small SMB part of our business. And we looked into that of course, and we manage that closely, and we look at the logo churn in that number, it's very consistent with the last several quarters. And I think what's happening is that smaller businesses aren't making new purchases, and I think as the economy picks up from here, we think eventually it will pick up, we're not sure when, but as it picks up, we believe that that part of the logo count will increase. On the high-end customers, the $1 million-plus ACV cohort was -- it's one of our strongest quarter ever for that cohort, including some big new wins. We had one of the leading global companies in customer experience and support signed a completely new customer to Okta over $1 million ACV deal and it was all around OIG. So, we're seeing a lot of new business momentum in the largest companies in the world, which is pretty satisfying. So, yes, lot of good stuff to point to in the quarter, but I think the macro environment is still, while stabilizing, it's still not as healthy as it could be for us and our business is reflecting that to some degree, especially the forward outlook.\nBrett Tighe: Yes. I would just add to that, Rob. We talked about the big deals. We actually had one of the biggest -- one of the strongest big deal quarters ever in the Company's history. So, we talked about some stats, but it's just in general, it was a very strong big deal quarter. But not just -- that wasn't the only highlight, there's a bunch of highlights. I mean, Todd talked about it about Customer Identity participation. That's up into the right. So, a lot of good things we're seeing in the business. Lot of great execution by the go-to-market team that we're really proud of, in spite of this macro headwind. In terms of your question more specifically on the current RPO guidance itself, really I mean that is a reflection of what we were just talking about in terms of the macro headwind. Yes, it did stabilize in the quarter, but we're being prudent with our outlook at this point given it is still a significant headwind for the field in terms of growing the business.\nRob Owens: Thanks.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, let's go to Ittai Kidron at Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Hey, guys. Solid numbers. I guess, Todd, maybe you could give us a little bit more color on OIG and maybe kind of parse it by the customer base. First of all, just to clarify, this applies just to Workforce customers, correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe you can dig a little bit into the install base, what percentage of your base already had the first couple of modules of the platform before and how adding the latest component changed the dynamics from a demand standpoint? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this was greenfield versus there was already a pent-up demand for it, number one; and number two, with the incremental new module, what is the upside just of that incremental to the existing base? I know the whole platform can add a lot, but it sounds like you already have a lot of customers on there. So, trying to get to the deal-type year of upside.\nTodd McKinnon: The first thing you ask about, you said it applies to Workforce. It's -- I mean OIG, we can sell OIG to any customer. So, OIG is a great upsell for Customer Identity customers. It's not as -- it's not as directly integrated to that part of the business, because usually that's managed by a separate team and kind of a separate process, but we sell OIG to Customer Identity customers. And, that's a good expansion point in terms of increasing the value of the whole customer, but the real synergy is with the Access Management product. It just makes a lot of sense. If you think about the system that is controlling and doing access management for which applications you can access at work, just makes sense that that tightly integrated governance system which actually does the approvals and the routing to your manager to approve, you can get a new application or a new resource and then report to your auditors that you indeed have the right access. That just is a tight bundle and it's like technically integrated tightly with Access Management. But when we look at our go-to-market and the ability to sell OIG, we have a bunch of customers that just have Customer Identity Cloud and in many cases, we have the potential to land the first Workforce deal with OIG. So, as an upsell to that Customer Identity Cloud customer, but it could be the first entry of the Workforce suite. So, in terms of like the penetration and so forth, the product is off to a very strong start. It's been generally available for a few quarters now. It's exceeding our expectations. And not just in terms of numbers and revenue, but also its exceeding our expectations in terms of the companies that are deploying it alongside of legacy governance products, but also the competitive displacements. I think the competitive displacements are something that we didn't think would happen this early to this degree, but we're seeing more of those than we expected. There was a good win, Ryder Truck Rentals, which is a Fortune 500 and Global 2000 company you've all heard of. It was -- they had a legacy product and they looked at OIG because we're -- we have other Workforce products in that account, we're helping them with those. They looked at OIG about a year ago and decided it wasn't feature-rich enough, it wasn't -- couldn't do what they needed it to do, but they were struggling with some of the enhancements on their legacy product and they ended up bringing in OIG this past quarter to replace their legacy product, so that's a pleasant surprise as well. So, it's -- we feel really good about this product and we're also really excited about the next entry in the Workforce tree which is Privileged Access. So, Okta Privileged Access which is on schedule, it's progressed from beta to early access. It's got couple of dozen customers using the product and having success with us. It's built out and it's on schedule for the general availability in Q4 of this year. So, lots of exciting stuff in the entire product suite and then specifically on the Workforce, those two examples are pretty exciting.\nBrett Tighe: And then, one more thing, Ittai, I just wanted to clarify. Hopefully, you heard earlier, but in terms of spend and upsell amounts that we're getting out of this, it's really about a third on average and the customers who have it, it's about a third of their total Workforce spend right now. So, it is a significant potential upsell in the entire 18,400-plus customer base. So, we're excited about the opportunity as we move forward.\nIttai Kidron: Can you tell us how penetrated are you into that 18,000, like what percent already have this?\nBrett Tighe: There's still a lot of opportunity to go.\nTodd McKinnon: It's a new product. I mean the component, it's -- as you -- there's the Lifecycle Management part of the product and there is the Workflows part of the product and then there is the wheel that rounds it out is the access certifications and the access requests part of it. The penetration rates in our installed base is the highest as you know for single sign-on and multi-factor authentication. And then the next highest, but not nearly as close -- nearly as penetrated as multi-factor or single sign-on is Lifecycle Management. Then the next highest is Workflows. And then there's only a few -- just the companies that have Governance, the SKU Governance actually have the certifications and the access request. So, there is a lot of room to run here and we're really excited about it.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Joe Gallo at Jefferies.\nJoe Gallo: Hey guys. Thanks for the question and nice quarter. CIAM has held in really well with ACV growing 29% year-over-year on tough comps. How should we think about the durability of that business? Is the sales force more at ease selling it now? And then you noted broad macro stabilization, does that have an outsized impact on CIAM? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: The data that we have for this quarter and the data we look at pretty closely in terms of your question about the sales force's comfort with it, with Customer Identity, is that there is more reps doing Customer Identity deals. So, that is at a healthy level, just the participation which conveys a lot of things. It conveys the rep's familiarity with it, their ability to execute the opportunities, et cetera, et cetera., so that we're comfortable with that. Overall, I think that the opportunity for Customer Identity is, it can be as -- ultimately, it can be as much contribution to the revenue as Workforce. We strive for a 50:50 split over the long-term and we think they both should be growing. The both markets are big and they both should be growing quickly. So, we think it has a lot of durability. It is different in that it's more, as we've talked about before, it's more of a build versus buy. The competitive dynamic is different. It's not -- really -- it's really a, the developers are choosing to buy something versus open source or build something themselves versus the Workforce Identity side has more established players, legacy players. Those companies are more used to buying a solution there and there's a different dynamic with the big platforms offering Workforce Identity along with their apps and services and trying to get customers locked into their whole stack. So, there's different dynamics, but we think both are big and both have a lot of room to run. And if you look at our strategy, our strategy is, we are the leader in Identity and we are the only at-scale independent and neutral player in Identity. And so, our strategy is to double-down on that by, first of all, covering all the Identity use cases. So, it's really important that we cover a customer, and cover all the parts of Workforce, and go to the market and say listen, Identity is a key part of your technological infrastructure, it's a key business driver for you and you should really bring up the level of your Identity partner to some of the biggest clouds you spend money on. And we do that by offering the full suite of products and plus, and very importantly, we're independent neutral. So, we're not going to foreclose choices of cloud infrastructure or security tools or collaboration tools because we have a horse in the race in terms of what we favor from our Identity, we're going to give customers choice and that's resonating and that's -- especially with the larger companies, which have very complex technological environments and a lot of people and a lot of -- lot to gain by getting the Identity right, and I think that's what you're seeing behind some of the results.\nJoe Gallo: Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Go to Adam Tindle at Ray J.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks, Dave. Todd, thanks for confirming the Privileged Access product for GA in Q4. I'm wondering kind of a two-part question, one, if you could give us maybe any feedback that you've gotten in that Early Access. And if you could compare it to the OIG product just to put it in context for us, that would be helpful. And then secondly, if we kind of zoom out to a bigger picture, you've often talked about a unified platform of Identity and if I fast forward, you're going to have Workforce, Customer, OIG, and the PAM products, sort of a holistic platform, wondering what that enables. If you've considered new go-to-markets like bundling and any update on the head of go-to-market alongside that would be helpful. Sorry, so many questions in there, but hopefully hit them all.\nTodd McKinnon: No worries. Yes, if I can remember them all, I'm going to be very proud of myself. First question was comparing Governance and Privileged Access, they are very similar in terms of the reception of the beta and now with Privileged Access to move into Early Access. So, the similarities are the -- really the value of this -- the -- a big value driver of the solutions is how natural it is to be integrated to Access Management. So, for example, with Privileged Access, you're going -- you're using Privileged Access to manage access to these resources like servers and containers and route accounts on servers and the fact that that's integrated with the system for these companies that does all of their access management for all their employees, for all their apps, and very importantly the fact that it's tied into the governance system, so you can actually do a workflow approval on who should get access to a container or a server, the same way you do a workflow approval on who should get access to a finance app or a collaboration app and more -- and probably more importantly, your auditors can see a single report that attests to the fact that the following, people have the right access to all the resources whether they are servers, containers, collaboration applications, or finance applications, that's really appealing. It's really appealing. So, I think we talked about it last call, that it's a little bit unfair to compare the OIG Early Access to the Privileged Access, because Privileged Access is coming second. And it's benefiting from the fact that the OIG features were integrated on top of it. So, that's really positive. I think that the Privileged Access is a little bit different in that, I do think traditionally a big decision-maker for privileged resources and what -- who controls them and who accesses them, was the infrastructure team, which is a new audience for us. The infrastructure team in the past has done a little bit with Okta, but it's a little bit of a new audience. So, that's why we're really relying on our appeal to the -- or our resonance with the Chief Security Officer and the CIO, which in more organizations has security -- the security risks get more prominent and people and Boards of Directors and CEOs are really trying to lock this down. We believe that the strategy of appealing to the Chief Security Officer to really have an umbrella approach across all of the company's security, their infrastructure, all the way to their employee systems will resonate. So, it's pretty exciting and we're off to a good start there I think. Your question about the broad platform that -- you talked about Workforce and we actually are parlance as we put Governance and Privileged under Workforce, it's under the same umbrella. And then, Customer Identity of course is our second major cloud. You talked about what does it mean for go-to-market. I think our go-to-market structure is set up to take advantage of it. So, we have one sales team that's -- the tenure of our sales reps and their participation in deals in terms of both clouds is -- are at levels that we're happy with and comfortable with, which is a great sign. The tenure, the ramp, and experience and the ability to do broad deals across the suite is healthy. And which means that, as the economy starts to improve and our message starts to resonate more, that's going to be really help us in the future get back to really high levels of scale and growth that we think are possible in this big market.\nAdam Tindle: Head of go-to-market?\nTodd McKinnon: I knew I forgot one, sorry. The search for a go-to-market President is progressing. It's -- we're meeting a ton of people, it's a really important search to get right. The next really three years to five years of what we're trying to do is, it's important that we find the right person for that role. So, we're meeting a bunch of candidates. We're not ready to announce anything yet, but it's a super important thing for us to focus on and get right and I can't wait to give you an update as soon as the events warrant it.\nAdam Tindle: Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. Next up, let's go to Anushtha Mittal at RBC.\nAnushtha Mittal: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I'm Anushtha on for Matt Hedberg. I wanted to ask a question on the legacy replacement opportunity for Access Management. It feels like there are some large legacy replacement deals starting to come up for grabs. So, how do you think about this opportunity and what are some catalysts that can help shift customers away from these legacy vendors to the Okta platform?\nTodd McKinnon: I think it's a really insightful question. I think it's -- if you look at the growth drivers and the potential, the market potential and the TAM being realized for Okta, it's a really big factor. The fact that it's traditionally been the way you do Identity is, you have a big on-premise installation and you control it yourself and you -- it's in your data center, it's legacy software, it's really tightly coupled with the stack, whether it's Oracle or IBM, and that's on the Workforce side. And then on the Customer Identity side, it's really build it yourself, maybe it's open source, maybe it's just build your own password checking and registration form and roll your own. And so, those two together are really as we think about catalysts in the business and long-term drivers, those are really important. When we talk about secular trends, cloud, and digital transformation, we're really talking about these kind of things like the people have a bunch of on-premise technology and they want to use on-premise technology to manage it and the more they move to the cloud, the more likely they are to choose a cloud modern next-generation solution like Okta. So, I think there is two dimensions that -- you asked for catalysts, I think there is really one dimension is what we talk about all the time, it's like more cloud technology, more -- I was talking to a big customer earlier this week that the real catalyst for them to look at their Workforce, reevaluating their Workforce Identity platform was really that finally they are getting into public cloud. They are taking tons of workloads out their own data center and moving into public cloud and that just changed a bunch of stuff, where it didn't make sense anymore given that they were going to some SaaS applications, and they were building some new applications and the way their network was going to work and the way their security perimeter was going to work, just didn't make any sense anymore to have the legacy solution. So, that's a catalyst. The second catalyst is the products are getting better. So, it's the fact that we have Privileged, the fact that Privileged Access come in GA in Q4, the fact that we have Okta Identity Governance starting to rollout. The fact that this is a big one, Okta is the only -- the only identity management provider, and this is a Workforce feature or a Workforce capability, that can do phishing-resistant authentication across every client device, across all applications in a comprehensive universal way. That's a huge differentiator. So, when you look at some of these big deals starting to move, it's not enough to do it just on Windows and just on some applications, Okta can do phishing-resistance everywhere. And a lot of the security breaches are just phishing and it's like phishing multi-factor authentication methods that aren't phishing-resistant, like SMS, SIM Swap and you've heard of that, or it's they do phishing of a one-time password number, there's all kinds of creative things. We have the only solution that's phishing-resistant, and it's across all platforms. And so the product is getting better too. So, I think those two things are going to help us continue to take advantage of this big opportunity we have over time.\nAnushtha Mittal: That's helpful. Thank you.\nTodd McKinnon: You're Welcome.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, we have Eric Heath at KeyBanc.\nEric Heath: Hey, can you hear me? I do.\nTodd McKinnon: Loud and clear, Eric.\nEric Heath: Appreciate it. Todd, I guess just for you on the execution side. Just curious where do you think we are in terms of what inning on the execution side, and maybe what's left to go? That's just the first part. And the second one, I just wanted to follow up on OIG. How much is the sales force at this point is kind of enabled to sell OIG and are you starting to feel the confidence yet to kind of get more aggressive and kind of roll this into the playbook and start to more displacements in perhaps the enterprise installed base?\nTodd McKinnon: I'm assuming on the first question, what inning we're in for execution, I'm assuming you meant kind of like Customer Identity Cloud integration, rep attrition, some of the stuff we talked about in the previous quarters. I think that is behind us. I think when we look at the clarity of the message of our two clouds, the participation rate of reps in the Customer Identity Cloud deals, I feel comfortable with those things. The overhang or the question there is, what is the macro impact and how long will it last? Because the -- because our overall, we think our go-to-market and our sales team can be more productive. We think it's first of all, you can always get better. There is always things we're doing to increase productivity and get better and striving to be better tomorrow than we are today. But I think -- I think the macro is a question mark there. We have our thoughts and our assumptions in the forecasts and in the models, but I think that the degree to which our productivity is trading off between macro and what the potential is, I think that's -- we'll have to see how that unfolds. And I think, frankly, we're taking a pretty conservative approach there assuming that the macro is going to be kind of is what it is for a while. We don't think it's going to get any worse, but we don't think it's going to get better tomorrow either. So, we're being pretty conservative on that.\nBrett Tighe: I would just add on that. I think one of the highlights, Eric, is the cross-selling tailwind that we've been receiving. So, that really highlights the team is executing and being able to deliver the value prop and deliver the value to the customers and I think that's a really good indicator of why things are working so well, because we have been doing some great cross-selling over the last few quarters, thanks in part to what Todd has been talking about around releasing Governance and obviously Device Access came out this last quarter and is adding to that as well, but it's -- I think it's just a combination of the products continuing to roll-off the assembly line, if you will, and also the improvements we're making to the product plus the execution from the field, just really improving, thanks to those tenure statistics that Todd was mentioning, as well as the ramp percentage now really at a very high level. So, we're pleased with how the team has really been executing. We're pleased with it.\nTodd McKinnon: And you also asked about the -- how much of the sales team is ramped on Governance, Okta Identity Governance. I think that it's like any new product and a product that is still early in its lifecycle and go-to-market, but exceeding our expectations. There is still more ramping and more education and more comfort and how the sales team is comfortable quantifying the opportunities, executing them, there is still ramping that's left to do there. And I think that -- I think that will continue really at scale and continue to ramp through next year. The reality is, we have a good sales team and a decent amount of sales capacity, and to get it fully comfortable selling Governance as they are with the rest of the products, it's going to take several quarters, but once it does, we have a great at scale sales team to take it broadly to market.\nEric Heath: Thanks, Todd.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, let's go to Angie Song at Morgan Stanley.\nAngie Song: Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. Just a quick one from me. Could you just remind us of how big the federal vertical is for Okta? And have you been seeing an uptick in momentum in this vertical in the last quarter, as you achieved FedRAMP High? Thank you.\nTodd McKinnon: The federal vertical is really a key important part of our strategy, it's not just a bunch -- it's not just a big IT spend, but it's also, they have very direct mandates to use multi-factor and to invest in modern Identity Solutions. I was -- I spent about a week in Washington during last quarter, and one of the really interesting things I noticed about the -- I mean, as a reminder, that I've known it for a while, but they are probably of -- all of a lot of most industries or most verticals. They're probably the most -- they have the most formal programs around Identity. All the big agencies have a formal office or department around Identity. So, I think they are just mature in how they think about it, and they're modernizing like everyone else. So, it's a really big opportunity for us. You mentioned the certifications, we did -- last quarter, actually two quarters ago, we received our FedRAMP High authorization, which is really exciting. And we have a bunch of marquee customers that sponsored us that for that authorization and we're excited to move forward, that we also have the ability to -- on the military side, we have the ability to service IL5 workloads, which opens up more of the Department of Defense and some of the more sensitive military sides and we have great customers there, so it's a really important part of our strategy and it's a big part of our focus. The other part of the business that's important is the state and local governments, so between federal, state, and local government, they need identity and we're doing very well in those verticals and it's a big area for our focus.\nBrett Tighe: Hey Angie, I would just -- I would just add, it's -- we're still in the early innings. We still have a lot of opportunity there. So, keep that in mind.\nAngie Song: Got it. Thank you so much.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Stefan Schwarz at [Wells Fargo] (ph).\nStefan Schwarz: It's Wells Fargo, actually. I'm on for Andy Nowinksi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about OIG. First, could you give us an update on how many customers you have using it now, and just if there's any color you could give on how they've been able -- how the price has been able to surprise in terms of competitive displacements that you mentioned you weren't expecting? And just your thoughts on how sustainable you think that is going forward. Thank you.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. The number of customers has exceeded our expectation significantly. Also the size of the deals, it's -- they're -- deal sizes are a very positive surprise on the upside, which is great. What we're seeing is that the -- it's usually a third of the you know increase of 30%-plus on the Workforce spend. So, if you're spending a $1 on Workforce, you add Governance, it's you're paying a $1.30 or more. So, that's really encouraging. And I think, I mentioned the example of, one of the other couple of surprises about, we thought it would be mostly a greenfield thing. We think the market for Governance is very underserved, and because the solutions, the legacy solutions haven’t been that good. We think we have a better solution, it's super-fast to rollout, it's very integrated with Access Management, it connects great, integrates great with the ecosystem, like we're really well-known for on the Access Management side. And I think because of that, we think we can make the market bigger. But I mentioned the example of Ryder Truck Rental, that was a competitive displacement. They had a legacy provider, they looked at OIG a year ago, didn't think it was up to snuff, they got kind of frustrated with the progress on their legacy, with their legacy provider, and they displaced it with us and they were rolled-out and have seen value from it very quickly. So, I think stories like that are really encouraging. I think that being said, it's still pretty early, both in terms of the potential it could have and which makes it very exciting as the strategy comes together on the Workforce side.\nStefan Schwarz: Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Yes, let's go to Shaul Eyal at Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, folks. Congrats. I want to double-click on Brett's commentary on contract duration, seeing sort of stability, maybe even improvement, is that driven by additional modules? Is that driven by pricing? And maybe, Todd, just a word about the competitive landscape, Microsoft, some other companies out there? I appreciate it. Thank you.\nBrett Tighe: Yes, I'll take the first part and let Todd take the second part. Around the contract duration, contract duration did tick up slightly in the quarter. It's really a product of those big deals, right. So, you heard about all the big deals we closed in the quarter and bigger deals typically come with bigger duration. So, the success we had in enterprise and strategic and of those large deals, that's really lending itself to have a slight uptick to that contract duration in the quarter. So we're pleased with how things trended there.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, on the competition question, something we obviously think about a lot. I think every company in the enterprise market thinks about it. And we analyze a lot of data and the -- I'll give you the kind of the quantitative answer. The quantitative answer is that the competitive environment is very stable, has been for few years now. And I think that the numbers we look at are win rates and so forth, we also look at the gross retention rate, which remains healthy. We look at -- you're always kind of looking around at the deals you're not in, it's hard to get a sense for the deals you're not in, but what we're seeing is that, based on all the numbers we see, especially in large enterprises, the pipeline is there, we're able to convert it, we're able to offer a broad solution that gives customers choice and flexibility. Those are all the numbers we look at. On the qualitative side, it's really a -- and this is more like when I have conversations with big customers, big government agencies, what they're trying to do, that it's really -- two things are really important competitively. One thing is that, companies and organizations are seeing Identity as critical. They're seeing it as the way they can get really tight on their cyber posture, they're seeing it as a way they can innovate quicker, deliver better solutions on the Customer Identity side and it's -- it really matters. When you're talking about being a strategic partner with a strategy to try to have a broad platform and deliver all these use cases, the first thing that has to happen is that the customers have to really think it matters and because of all these trends we've talked about and the value we can provide, Identity really matters. The second thing that's really important, which is, is the -- how integrated the Identity system is to the rest of the ecosystem. Do customers perceive that as facilitating choice and flexibility? And that is -- the conversations are really positive on that. They're really starting to see that we announced earlier this week, this capability called Okta for the Global 2000 and this is a really, really important architectural advantage we have, particularly versus Microsoft. And this resonates very well with large companies, which is Microsoft built its Identity technology as a part, as an integral bundled part of e-mail in collaboration. And so the result of that is if you want to have the flexibility that you can do with Okta, where you can have Okta for a business unit or a company you want to buy or a company you want to divest or you want to have parts of Okta that govern rules for the whole organization and parts of it that govern rules just for a subdivision or a distributed part of the IT department, you can do that with Okta. We have flexibility in our architecture, and we have capabilities. We have at-scale customers like NTT and others doing this. And Okta for Global 2000, really, we've added some capabilities to make it easier to manage and do some better visibility across the different domains, and it's really powerful. With Microsoft, if you do that, you have to essentially have different e-mail systems because of the way they bundle their e-mail to their identity. So if you want to have a distributed rules about who can do what, you basically have to have two e-mail domains, which -- and you have to have two teams domains, which doesn't make any sense. You would never want to have for a company you buy, you never want to have a different teams address for those users. And that's just the trade-off they made when they decided to bundle their identity with their apps, and I understand why they did it. Their strategy is, hey, use the whole bundle, use Microsoft apps, use Microsoft Tech, use Microsoft Security. We're all going to do it all for you. And that certainly does appeal to some companies, but it's mostly the companies that are super cost conscious, don't see the strategic value of identity, maybe are more reacting in their posture in their markets and their strategy versus being aggressive and building new things and trying to expand and grow. And we're able to provide that flexibility to give that real that business agility with our architecture. So that really resonates with particularly with big companies and the flexibility and seeing identity as a thing that matters, independence matters. And that's what -- for longer term, we're all in the -- we're all in this for the long term at Okta. We want to build this important company that's going to provide value and really be an iconic company in the future. So to believe that's true. You have to believe a couple of things. One is you have to believe that identity is going to matter. And for the reasons we've talked about, it truly does. And the second thing is you have to believe that the independent neutral company is going to win. And if you look at everything we do, whether it's broad platform capabilities, different identity markets, whether it's focusing on the ecosystem integration and the flexibility, that's why what we're doing is resonating. And that's why we think it's pretty different from some of the big cloud platforms and some of the other legacy players out there as well.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nTodd McKinnon: Happy to help.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, we have Scotiabank.\nBill Vandrick: Hey, you've got Bill Vandrick on for Patrick Colville. So just looking at the cRPO guide, it calls for 13% growth next quarter. How should we think about how that will translate to fiscal '25 revenue growth?\nBrett Tighe: Yes, it's a good question. Thank you. I would actually correlate a couple of things. Well, first and foremost, like before I get into the correlation, the way you should look at a reminder at Q3 earnings, we're going to stick with our historical precedent, and we're going to give you an early look on FY '25 revenue. It will be a prudent look at us five quarters out. So just a reminder, we'll do that. But in the meantime, if you want to bridge that gap between now and then I would look at a couple of things, yes, I would look at the dollars of current RPO right? And they will roll off into subscription revenue over the next 12 months. You can look at historical correlation and figure that out. And then I would pair that with the trend of revenue in FY '24, 23% growth that we just produced in Q2, $560 million and 16% growth in Q3, and then Q4, you can imply that based on our fiscal year guide, that's about 14% year-over growth. So I would combine that trend with the current RPO historical correlations to get you in the rough area for FY '25 but we will come out with our first look, like I said, in the Q3 earnings in about 90 days' time on FY '25.\nBill Vandrick: Thanks, Brett.\nBrett Tighe: No problem.\nDave Gennarelli: Go to Ray at Guggenheim.\nRay McDonough: Great, thanks. Todd, you mentioned a couple of times that you continue to be surprised by the types of accounts that we're deploying the government solution. And last quarter, we talked about OIG potentially accelerating PAM adoption. So as you think about the general availability of PAM later on in 4Q, do you see the same potential with that product and potentially displacing existing solutions or penetrating larger accounts? Or do you still expect the PAM solution to kind of attack this greenfield opportunity more down market?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. I don't necessarily agree or -- it sounds like we're arguing, we're not arguing. I don't know if the greenfield is really a down market thing. I think there's big companies that it's greenfield as well. See different maturities on different -- especially parts of big companies. And so I think that one of the things -- one of the lessons that OIG is that I think that the segmentation of what we thought would be the applicability of solution was pretty awful. We thought it kind of would be mid-market and below. We've seen success in really large companies, organizations like Kyndryl, for the global company I mentioned with -- in terms of the leading the -- one of the leading customer experience and support solutions standardizing on OIG as a net new customer. On the privilege side, I think that -- and also on the government side, it's like -- I always get surprised when companies take out a big piece of technology that they invested in that's working. And the secret about some of these big governance deployments is they're actually not working that well. And they kind of went into it with this broad view of all the functionality they would need and how everything they want to hook it up to and what they're seeing after several years is that they're kind of really only using part of it. And then when you compare what we have to that, it's -- sometimes we exceed what they're actually using. So then the decision to actually swap it out is kind of beating our expectations. My guess is that it could -- the same thing could happen in privilege. I would guess that it's just a conservative guess would be that it's going to be where we have success, it's going to be where they don't have a solution and its -- they want to extend the benefits they've seen with Okta Access Management and Governance into those privileged resources. And I think that probably means coexistence. But I still continue to block set this over and over to many people that we've talked before. It's like I think that we're really in almost a different market. The company that had Oracle and Sun servers in their own data center, and they put CyberArk in there, they're not going to take that out for Okta Privilege. But I do think that, that same company may have a division that's doing more cloud development, they have containers and they want to get quickly some the same benefits they have for their Okta deployment on top of some of those resources and get the auditing capabilities and the workflow capabilities and the access control capabilities. But I just don't see them taking out a legacy CyberArk deployment that's kind of working and protecting their Oracle database and their own data center.\nRay McDonough: Great. Thanks for the color. That’s makes sense.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. Happy to help.\nDave Gennarelli: Hey, let’s go to what I believe is [Caroline] (ph), Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you. Quick one from me is just on Okta's new partner program. I think you launched that in April of this year. Just Curious what the initial reception to that has been? And then also, given the differences in go-to-market and workforce and customer, kind of how does that translate to the partner strategy in each of those clouds?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, the partner revamped the purposes behind it were -- the fundamentals were super sound. We wanted to get more focused, more focused on the most valuable partners -- and it's -- we've had that launched for a couple of quarters now. It's going well. I think we're seeing good partner contribution in the pipeline, which is a good thing. Overall, it's not specific to that program -- those program changes. But overall, partners continue to be super important for Okta. Particularly, excited about the partnership with Google Workspace for their go-to-market. The Google Workspace sellers around the world and a public sector can sell Okta, and that's a natural -- really natural alignment there with -- we're trying to give the Google customers a bunch of choice in technology and Google is trying to give the same message kind of saying you can use workspace and the Google tools to collaborate with anyone, across company boundaries, no matter what you use for the rest of your communications and collaboration infrastructure. So it's a very aligned go-to-market that we're excited about that one. We're excited about the cloud service provider marketplaces. That's a new channel that's really emerging and been strong for us. We've mentioned the AWS Marketplace for a couple -- a few quarters in a row. It continues to grow very quickly. Customers want to that they really have big investments with Amazon, they want to retire and pay down some of their AWS credits, and they can do that on Okta through the marketplace, which is great. So partnership is really important. I think one of the biggest opportunities and something we're really focused on and trying to really mature is our motion with the Global Systems Integrators. Global Systems Integrators are especially in large enterprise on workforce. They do a lot of business, and they're going to be really key as we start to rip and replace some of these legacy technologies, especially on the governance side. So the relationship and the partnerships with the Global Systems Integrators is super important. We're focused on that. And very interesting on the customer identity side, it's a natural -- it's very naturally appealing to the Global Systems Integrators because they're trying to -- they want to develop solutions and do digital transformations for these companies and customer identity to help them do that. They can help them build some of the other differentiating capabilities and not have to recreate some of the identity parts that we already do in customer identity cloud. So it's an important part of our business. We're kind of a -- we've always Okta is like very good at partnering just because it's been so important to us from the beginning. We had to partner with ISVs and apps and in the channel and so forth, and we're pretty proud of our ability to partner, but we're continued to double down on it because it is an important part of the ecosystem part of our business.\nDave Gennarelli: Hey, we've got -- we're up on time, but let's go into overtime here. We've got five more hands raised. Let's go to…\nTodd McKinnon: We have to start scheduling these longer.\nDave Gennarelli: Yes. Let's go to -- I think [Patrick] (ph) at Wolfe.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, guys. It's Patrick on for Josh.\nTodd McKinnon: Hi, Patrick.\nUnidentified Analyst: Congrats on the quarter over time. So you mentioned that OpenAI expanded the relationship. And I think that's not the first time, maybe the second or third time that you've actually called that out. Is that kind of coming from the customer side or the workforce side? I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit more on what products they're expanding with and seeing uses with. And then also, was that any meaningful contribution to growth in the quarter from OpenAI specifically?\nTodd McKinnon: Patrick, I lost you for a minute there. So if the question was for me, I needed you to repeat like the first 20 seconds.\nBrett Tighe: Yes. I lost you as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, can you hear me.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, we can hear you. You came back [Multiple Speakers]\nUnidentified Analyst: Sorry about that. So I was asking about OpenAI. I think this is like the second or third time that you've called out. significant expansion with them in a quarter in a relatively short time. Is that kind of coming on the customer side, the workforce side, what products are they using and seeing success with? And then was there any meaningful contribution to growth from them in the quarter with that expansion?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. So OpenAI is super interesting. So they're -- OpenAI as a customer identity cloud customer, which so when you log in and ChatGPT, you log in through Okta. And it's interesting because a developer inside of OpenAI three years ago picked our customer identity cloud because it had a great developer experience and from the website and started using it. And this Chat -- and at the time, it was the log-in for their APIs and then ChatGPT took off. And now, as you mentioned, we've had really pretty sizable transactions with them over the last couple of quarters. And so it's a great testament to our strategy on customer identity, having something that appeals to developers. And you saw they did something pretty interesting -- and so this is really a B2C app, right, of ChatGPT but they -- now they recently launched their enterprise offering, and they want to connect ChatGPT to enterprises. So this is -- Okta is really good at this, too, because our customer identity cloud connects our customers to consumers, but also connects our customers to workforces. So then you have to start supporting things like single sign-on and Sam and Open ID and authorization. And so it's just open API continues to get the benefits of being able to focus on what they want to focus on, which is obviously their models in the LLMs and the capabilities, and we can focus on the identity plumbing that wires it together. So the transaction was -- it was one of the top -- I mentioned the top 25 transactions. The total TCV of all this transaction was -- this quarter was $100 million. It was one of those top 25 transactions, but I don't -- I haven't done the math on the TCV for how much of the $100 million it was. But it was one of our -- it was on the larger side this quarter.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. Let's go to Shrenik at Baird.\nShrenik Kothari: Hey, thanks for prolonging the Q&A. I think it's a good idea. So Todd, Brett, great to hear the cross-sell momentum to speak about OIG and PAM and PAM, of course, the early traction as well as the device access. On the commentary, on Okta for Global 2000, I think that, Todd, you expanded upon it. It's like an architecture differentiator and then a competitive advantage. And I guess on impressing you mentioned that the solution has already become a critical component of your sort of large new upsell transaction. So just curious, like, is that becoming or potentially will become a driver. Is it still just like an add-on to the bundle at this point? So just curious in terms of its contribution in terms of the upsell and the uplift momentum? And how are you and Brett as well kind of factoring it and going forward. Really be helpful.\nTodd McKinnon: The Okta for Global 2000, it's -- you mentioned the competitive differentiation, which is true. What I explained about that is relevant. It's also -- there's also something more important about it, which is if you think about what Okta is trying to do, we are -- we're the leader in identity. We want to make sure everyone in the world knows how important identity is. And traditionally identity has been sold at a -- as part of other platforms, you kind of got it when you bought the Windows network, you got it when you bought Oracle and some junior person in IT made the decision. But it's so important now with all the things it can do for companies. And one of the most important parts about Okta for Global 2000 is what we're saying to the world is identity can actually impact your business strategy. As a CEO, I know this. As a CEO, I think about all the time, like what things I want to do centrally, like do I want to do function centrally, do I want to have the HR team be central or do I want to decentralize it? Do you want to buy this company? Do I want to take part of a group that is centralized and decentralized it? And those are strategic decisions and CEOs and Boards care about those. And you can't make one of those decisions today unless you're also making the technology decision because when you decentralize that HR department or you buy that company, you're making a decision about how the technology is going to work, what -- how the apps are going to work, how the security is going to work on that. And to do that effectively, you have to have an identity system that's flexible and lets you roll out things quickly across the whole company, make policies across the whole company when you really want to lock down security, free up parts of the organization, do their own things. They can use their own HR system. They can use their own rules, and they can use their own platforms to be effective. Those are identity decisions. So I would say that is more important on the message. And when we say we have Okta for the Global 2000, we want to make sure that message gets across. You actually what you buy, you actually buy Okta's products. So you buy Okta's products. They're licensed in a way that's convenient and works for all of these capabilities working together. But the way I would think about the business driver is Okta identity is more relevant. People know about the relevance of it. We can differentiate it effectively and the overall workforce and customer product suite will be sold more effectively at scale to the biggest companies in the world.\nShrenik Kothari: Got it. Thanks, Todd.\nDave Gennarelli: Yes, let's go to Peter Weed at Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. Appreciate you going in overtime here. I'd love to go back to kind of -- you started the conversation, emphasizing the strength with some of your largest customers, obviously frustrating that maybe the SMB side hasn't been as strong and that sits some of the logo and hopefully, that comes back. But I'd love to dig in on those larger customers a little bit more and understand where the growth is coming from. Are we hearing about set reacceleration there? Or is this mostly about the kind of excitement of the Broader Okta platform and selling through more functionality. And we may even get a bigger boost from seat re-expansion in the future? And then kind of like when you look out at the pipeline, obviously, the sales team is kind of stacking up stuff coming into the future like how unusual is this quarter? Is this -- was this like a big bubble in the pipeline? Are you seeing similar type of setup in the next couple of quarters where we could see really good expansion on kind of similar types of execution?\nTodd McKinnon: On the seed expansion question, I think seat expansion definitely is muted with the macro. So I think the success in large enterprise is more products. And I mentioned the OIG new business land at the global customer experience company. We have -- another example I can think of it was a big transaction in a well-known online real estate company, that was an addition of customer identity cloud. So selling the customer identity cloud to what was already a workforce customer. And then there's examples in the customers and large customers of selling expansions of products, whether it's upsells to advance multifactor authentication on the workforce side. So I would say it's more use case expansion versus seat expansion. The pipeline is interesting. The pipeline for the current quarter we're in, in the fourth quarter are very strong. And I think the thing we have to really think about is in this macro environment, how that's going to translate? We've seen in the past few quarters that the typical conversion rates and the close rates, not the competitive rates but the close rates of how much the pipeline goes into actual closed deals has changed since the economic times of a few years ago. So that's the part we have to be prudent about. There's stabilization in the macro. We've talked about the numbers. But I think we're taking a little bit of a wait-and-see approach before we assume that those pipeline numbers are going to fall down into the closed business category at the rates that were -- maybe you saw a year or so ago?\nPeter Weed: Well, that's exact. Hopefully, signals of no churn and salespeople and these types of things means people think they can make their quota numbers, which will turn into some results for us.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. No, I agree with you there.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. Let's go to Madeline Brooks at BofA.\nMadeline Brooks: Hi, can you guys hear me?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, we can loud and clear, Madeline.\nMadeline Brooks: I would start my video, but we're moving floors in our office. I don't have a camera currently finishing the up video. But I just you could go back to -- and I'm not going to ask for any forward-looking guidance, but I'm just trying to think about floor as we go into next year, what would need to change for cRPO growth could be maybe high single digit. Is that win rate tough to really drastically be cut? Is that more of a factor of macro?\nBrett Tighe: Yes. I mean, we're definitely not going to give guidance today for next year for current RPO. So thank you for saying that, but...\nMadeline Brooks: Fine, yes.\nBrett Tighe: But ultimately, when we're thinking about next year, really, we're focused on the second-half of this year. If you think about current RPO, even more important to revenue is really the second-half of fiscal year '24, given our subscription model. So we're obviously excited and optimistic about the second-half, but we need to execute inside this macro headwind. I think the biggest factor in this next half or even if you stretch it out even to next year, it's really what does the macro do? Because we do believe that the broader go-to-market team and the total company is really executing well, both on the top line and on the bottom line. So really pleased with how everyone is performing at this point through Q2 and as we enter into the second-half of the year.\nMadeline Brooks: So just a quick follow-up to that, if I may. So if I think about over just thinking into next year, the growth though and for the fourth quarter as well, just in terms of translating to historical, maybe like seasonal norms of budget flush. What are the thoughts feel that this year maybe budget flush is going to be stabilized. And if I think to like taking down cRPO guidance 5% from this quarter to next quarter versus your comments on stability. How do we kind of marry those two?\nBrett Tighe: Yes. It's purely -- even though the macro is stabilizing, it is still a significant headwind. And so we're factoring that into Q3. And in terms of the budget flush in Q4, obviously, we'll update you guys with our Q4 guidance on the next earnings call and now, obviously, how the results go at the end of Q4. But we are expecting the macro to still be a considerable headwind to the second-half. And so we are adjusting our expectations or giving you expectations accordingly.\nMadeline Brooks: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nBrett Tighe: No problem.\nDave Gennarelli: And last but not least, we've got Brian Essex at JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: All right. Great. Thanks, guys and thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe, Brett, on that last comment. Can you maybe just clarify because I might have missed it during the prepared remarks. But are you thinking about the macro deteriorating in the second-half of the year? Is it staying the same? And then I just have a quick follow-up for Todd.\nBrett Tighe: Yes, we view it as stabilizing. So in other words, what we saw in Q2, we believe it stays that way in Q3 and Q4.\nBrian Essex: Got it. And then maybe, Todd, just I think last quarter you noted and it was just noted a couple of questions ago that just better sales retention. Is this the fourth quarter of better sales force retention? And what are the plans for hiring productivity and any kind of executive changes on the sales force front through the rest of the year? Just trying to get a sense of what the overall kind of like cultural environment is like there from a sales perspective.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, it's a great question. The attrition has been a healthy level for a couple of quarters now. And then obviously, if attrition is a healthy level, you get ramps. People start to ramp. And the data we see that one of the points we look to is the participation in customer identity cloud deals, and that's at a healthy level as well. But the productivity can still be better and we think the productivity is really macro related. And so I think the last thing that could improve is productivity, but we have to see what the macro does. But it's -- we are working very hard to get better. It's not like we're just waiting around waiting for the macro to get better. We're -- as we always do, we're enabling, we're making sure that people -- the processes and the handoffs and the marketing funnel is running well. And so we're doing a lot of stuff. And it's really a testament to, I think, the leadership we have on the sales side. We have John Addison running the sales team globally on an interim basis. We have a search out for a new President go-to-market, and we're going to get the right -- it's very important. We put the right person in that job because that's going to be the person that takes us over the next three to five years to new heights, and we're going to get the right person there. So I think overall, the vibe is positive in the ultimately, I think the attrition is kind of a good metric for that. But even beyond that, I think just anecdotally when you talk to people and see how people are feeling and seeing success and how they're seeing success. It's a positive odd. So that portends well for the second-half of the year and beyond.\nBrett Tighe: Brian, it might be an easier take than my boss. But I would have had four quarters in a row, but he's saying two. So yes, I think we've definitely strong a bunch of quarters together, really healthy attrition. And I think what Todd was saying, it comes through in the results.\nBrian Essex: Alright. Sounds good. Thank you so much.\nDave Gennarelli: All right. Thanks, everybody. Before we go, I just want to let you know that we'll be attending several conferences this quarter, as well as bus tours. We'll be at the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco on September 5, the Wolfe TMT Conference in San Francisco on September 6, also at the Citi Conference in New York on September 6 and the Piper Sandler Growth Conference in Nashville on September 13. And of course, we hope to see you in San Francisco for Oktane and our Executive Panel Summit on October 4. So that's it for today's meeting. If you have any follow-up questions, you can reach us at investor@okta.com. Thanks, everybody."

And now, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Todd McKinnon. Todd?\nTodd McKinnon: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Okta continues to build on its position as the leading independent identity partner. Our Two Clouds, One Okta strategy has really taken root with our go-to market team and our customers and partners love it too. The actions we've taken over the past few quarters to increase efficiency and improve profitability enabled us to deliver strong non-GAAP operating profit and record cash flow. We achieved these results despite increased pressure in the macroeconomic environment, which we anticipated when we introduced the FY'24 financial targets last quarter. We continue to take a conservative approach to our business outlook. We're also pleased to have turned the corner on the challenges we faced last year. Attrition in our go-to market team has significantly decreased over the past three quarters to its lowest level in two years. The number of fully ramped salespeople is close to a more normalized level as average tenure increases. And we're seeing positive trends in the number of sales reps closing Customer Identity Cloud deals. I'll now cover some of the highlights and achievements in the quarter that we believe position Okta for long-term success. Turning to our Q1 results, we added 450 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer base to over 18,000, representing growth of 14%. Like last quarter, new customer growth is an area that we believe has been impacted by the macro environment. We continue to see growth with large customers for both Workforce and Customer Identity and we are proud to work with some of the most important organizations in the world such as OpenAI, the US Air Force Recruiting Service and AIA. In Q1, we added 150 customers with $100,000 plus ACV. Our total base of $100,000 plus ACV customers now stands at over 4,080 and grew 23%. We're also seeing continued strength in customers with over $1 million of ACV. We now have over 300 customers with $1 million plus ACV, which continues to be the fastest growing customer cohort with growth of over 40%. Here are just a few notable examples of customer wins and upsells in Q1, which come from a wide range of industries. A business line of a Fortune 500 semiconductor company was an exciting new business win in Q1. The company's legacy technology was complex, not adequately secure and couldn't meet the needs of the business line. It selected Okta Workforce Identity Cloud to modernize its technology stack to meet industry compliance standards and for Okta's ability to address multiple identity use cases. The business line also selected Okta Identity Governance to manage partner access to critical collaboration applications. We continue to see great cross-selling between Workforce Identity Cloud and Customer Identity Cloud. Two great examples in Q1 were with Indeed and NerdWallet. Indeed, the world's most visited job site started as a self-service customer and has since leveraged Okta Customer Identity Cloud to power authentication for its corporate customers. This quarter, the company expanded with Okta Workforce Identity Cloud, including Okta Identity Governance to bolster its security posture and improve the user experience for its approximately 13,000 employees. NerdWallet a platform that provides financial guidance to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses was another great example of cross-selling between our two clouds and a great illustration of how our customers layer on more and more Okta capabilities over time. NerdWallet has been leveraging Okta Workforce Identity Cloud since 2017 to secure access for its employees. Last year, the company added Okta Identity Governance to streamline its compliance processes. In Q1, NerdWallet further expanded with Okta as it replaced its homegrown Customer Identity Solution with our Customer Identity Cloud. Okta Identity Governance or OIG continues to show strong traction. The initial customer demand is validating the desire for a modern approach to governance, one that is cloud based and integrates seamlessly with access management. In just the past six months hundreds of organizations have purchased OIG, including Q1 wins with Indeed, Amplitude and Australian Football League. We're really excited about the future of OIG, especially since of the customers that have purchased OIG so far. Their OIG spend is typically around one-third or more of their total Workforce Identity Cloud spend. It's great to see OIG off to a fantastic start. Never Stop Innovating is a core Okta value and we continue to make important advancements on that front. We made a number of significant product advancements for our Workforce Identity Cloud in Q1. Advanced phishing resistance is now generally available with Okta FastPass. FastPass gives end users a seamless user experience without passwords. It now protects users against phishing with advanced phishing resistance for the enterprise, covering every user on any device and major operating system. Okta Identity Engine began shipping with every new workforce customer in early 2022. We have made great progress in converting existing customers over to OIE and now over 40% of our workforce customers are on OIE. Building on this, we recently rolled out self-service OIE upgrades so customers can automate their upgrade. This self-service option will help accelerate the pace of upgrades, paving the way for even more customers to reap the benefits and power of OIE. More customers on OIE means greater opportunity to upsell our higher value services and also higher retention rates based on customers converting to date. We're now in beta testing with Okta Privileged Access. We're extending the same great secure access management as well as identity governance capabilities to privileged resources. Businesses will be able to easily integrate modern cloud infrastructure such as AWS, EC2 or Kubernetes into Okta for centralized policies and controls across the resources their workers need. Organizations are recognizing the value in the convergence of IGA, PAM and Access management and Okta is in a unique position to address our Customers Identity needs with a unified identity solution. We continue to expect general availability of Okta Privileged Access by the end of this year. We're also innovating on Okta's Customer Identity cloud, which processes billions of logins per month from around the world and provides a unique vantage point to both network traffic and application level security event data. All of this data enables us to identify patterns and detect anomalies as potential security attacks. We're harnessing that data for Security Center, which is now generally available for Okta Customer Identity Cloud. Security Center is a dashboard delivering real-time insights into potential attacks, allowing for security teams to respond quickly. In a heterogeneous technology world and an ever expanding number of devices and applications, Best-of-Breed technology is the future to help foster Best-of-Breed. Okta continues to expand our technology partnerships so that our customers can deploy the most innovative solutions while enhancing security, all while retaining freedom of choice. Here are just a couple of our latest technology partnership developments. We've had technology integrations and partnerships with Google for over a decade and have a deep base of shared customers. In the first phase of a new go-to market alliance announced last month, Google's Workspaces, global and public sector sellers will now co-sell Okta's Workforce Identity cloud alongside Google Workspace. This expanded partnership will enable both Okta and Google to reach new customers through a Best-of-Breed approach to security and productivity. In partnership with Zoom last month we announced Okta Authentication for end-to-end encrypted meetings for all paid joint customers. This new feature leverages Okta to authenticate a meeting attendees identity to determine if a meeting guest is who they say they are. Critical to Okta's success over the years has been our indirect channel partners. Historically, Okta turned to partners primarily for reach and as Okta has grown, we've recognized the need to engage with partners more strategically. Last month we unveiled our new partner program called Elevate. The program will recognize and reward partners for the full spectrum of value they can deliver to our customers and Okta from finding, developing and influencing to delivering, managing and transacting. The more of these motions a partner offers the more value they provide to Okta and our mutual customers. Streamlining operations and accelerating business technology are critical to establishing Okta as a primary cloud. To help drive these initiatives. I've asked Eugenio Pace, Co-Founder of Auth0 to take on the newly created role of President of Business Operations. Eugenio will turn his attention to the overall growth and operational excellence of Okta, including further accelerating our go-to market effectiveness and increasing automation across the company. Eugenio has a uniquely deep knowledge of the identity market and is an incredible partner. I've always been proud of our bench talent. So with Eugenio's new focus, Shiven Ramji, who has been a senior leader at Auth0 and Okta for nearly four years, will lead Customer Identity Cloud. To wrap things up, we delivered significantly improved profitability and record cash flow in the face of increasing macro related pressure. At the same time, we continue to deliver value to our customers and underscore our leadership position through product innovation. Identity is a key building block for zero trust security, digital transformation and cloud adoption projects. Trends that will continue in any macroeconomic environment as organizations look for ways to become more efficient while strengthening their security posture. Over the next decade, identity will become increasingly important, and we firmly believe that the winner will be independent, neutral and will deliver a unified platform covering both Customer Identity and Workforce Identity acts across access management, governance and privileged access. Okta is the best positioned company to deliver this to the market and expand on our leadership position, all while delivering profitable growth over the long-term. Now here's Brett to walk you through more of the Q1 financial results and our outlook.\nBrett Tighe: Thanks, Todd, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We continue to make meaningful progress on the actions we've taken to drive efficiency in our cost structure. As Todd noted, we're achieving these results while investing in our platform and business to fuel our future growth. As we navigate the increasing pressures of the macro environment, we remain confident that we have set the path of profitable growth for years to come. I'll review our first quarter results and our outlook for Q2 and FY'24. But first I'll start with some commentary on the macro environment. We're seeing increased macro headwinds on our business, most notably with new business across SMB and enterprise. These impacts were felt in varying degrees on a global basis. Similar to Q4, customers are requesting shorter contract term lengths and our overall business was weighted more towards upsells versus new business. We're also seeing smaller average deal sizes as a result. And finally we continue to experience minor FX headwinds on our top line metrics which are incorporated into our reported numbers and outlook. Turning to our Q1 results. Total revenue growth for the first quarter was 25%, driven by a 26% increase in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue represented 97% of our total revenue. International revenue grew 23% and represented 21% of our total revenue. RPO or subscription backlog grew 9%. Impacting total RPO growth is the general shortening of term lengths of recently signed contracts. Our overall average term length is just over two and half years. Current RPO, which represents subscription backlog, we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months grew 20% to $1.70 billion. Turning to retention, consistent with prior quarters, gross retention rates remain very healthy in the mid 90% range. Our dollar based net retention rate for the trailing 12 month period remained strong at 117%. The sequential downtick in the net retention rate stemmed from a decrease in the upsell rate with both enterprise and SMB customers. Given the current macro environment, customers are not expanding seats at the rate they have in recent years, and we believe this trend will persist in this environment. On a positive note, we are seeing strong growth in cross-selling of products. As always, the net retention rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as the mix of new business renewals and upsells fluctuates. Before turning to expense items and profitability, I'll point out that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results going forward. Looking at operating expenses. Total operating expenses for the quarter were lower than expected. The better than expected profitability is primarily due to the combination of revenue over performance and better than expected outcomes from spend efficiency measures. Total headcount at the end of Q1 was approximately 5,700. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the restructuring action taken at the beginning of Q1. Q1 free cash flow was a record $124 million, yielding a free cash flow margin of 24%. This includes the cash outlay of approximately $14 million related to the organizational restructuring. During the first quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $366 million of our 2025 convertible debt notes, resulting in a $31 million GAAP only gain. We will continue to regularly evaluate our capital structure and capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong anchored by $2.37 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Before getting into our outlook, I wanted to provide an update on equity dilution. At our Investor Day last November, I indicated that our historic norms for net dilution was in the 2% to 3% range and that we expected that range to be elevated in the near term, primarily related to the change in our stock price. I'm pleased to report that due to changes that we implemented, including changes in our granting practices and slowed hiring, net dilution for FY'23 finished better than expected at less than 3.5%. And we now believe that dilution for FY'24 will be back within our historical range. Managing dilution will continue to be a focus area and we remain committed to further reduction over the long-term. Now let's turn to our business outlook for Q2 and FY'24. Our projections continue to factor in the increased pressure from the macroeconomic environment. As a reminder, we've taken several actions to reduce our cost structure and increase our efficiency as an organization which will benefit margins this year and beyond. With that as a backdrop for the second quarter of FY'24, we expect total revenue of $533 million to $535 million, representing growth of 18%. Current RPO of $1.71 billion to $1.72 billion representing growth of 14% to 15%. Non-GAAP operating income of $36 million to $38 million and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.21 to $0.22. Assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 180 million. For FY'24, we are raising our revenue outlook by $15 million at the high end of the range. We now expect revenue of $2.175 billion to $2.185 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%. We are raising our outlook for non-GAAP operating income by $25 million to $161 million to $170 million, which yields a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 7% to 8%. Non-GAAP net income per share is raised to $0.88 to $0.93 assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 180 million. And we are raising our free cash flow margin outlook for FY'24 to approximately 12% from approximately 10% previously. Lastly, I want to provide a couple of comments to help with modelling Okta. Similar to years past, Q2 is expected to be the seasonal low for cash flow and we are applying a static 26% non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year. To wrap things up, we've taken action to drive efficiencies in our cost structure while investing to fuel our future growth. And we're confident that we are positioning the company for many years of profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for Q&A. Dave?\nDave Gennarelli: Thanks, Brett. I see that there are quite a few hands raised already and I'll take them in the order. In the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question and then you're welcome to queue back up with additional questions.\nA - Dave Gennarelli: So the first question goes to Rob Owens at Piper.\nRob Owens: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everybody. Was hoping you could help me out a little bit with somewhat the disconnect, I guess, between cRPO and how it's trending in annual revenue. I mean, annual revenue is inching up a point here, 17%, 18% but cRPO going the other way. So realizing that a lot of that is subscription revenue, it's already in the bank. But trends definitely are pointing the other way. So is that 14%, 15% guide, is that somewhat of a low watermark as we kind of contemplate the back half of the year? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Hey, Rob. Nice to see you. I'll take a shot at it from a big picture perspective and then Brett can probably add some details on the guidance. The quarter and the year is off to a solid start. I feel like the customer base is super solid. We're seeing really healthy gross renewals in the same range we've seen for several quarters, indicating that base of customer strength. We're also seeing the momentum in terms of conversations and importance of identity be really quite strong. The macro is a little bit of a different story. We talked a little bit about the macro headwinds we're seeing to an increasing degree. It's interesting, the way it's manifesting itself in the numbers is a little bit average deal size is a little bit lower. The new customer count is a little lower than we would have expected. But interestingly enough, in terms of the -- a lot of the executional -- or a lot of the execution metrics we're looking at, whether it's sales force attrition or the amount of sales reps doing a CIC deal, which is two things we've been watching a lot on the go-to-market side over the last few quarters, are getting better and better. So that's very positive. Another interesting thing is that more -- the large deals over $1 million and customers crossing that $1 million ACV threshold is up over 40% so that's super positive. So it's -- I think it's a lot of things to be positive about, solid execution, improving execution. And -- but the macro backdrop is just there's a lot of uncertainty around it. So that is kind of a high level how we're looking at the business and color some of our outlook.\nBrett Tighe: I can add a little bit there. I mean, I think from a current RPO guide, irrespective, obviously, we've been thoughtful about the macro I mean, we talked about it over the last few minutes and how it's really been affecting us a little bit more every quarter. So we're being prudent about that side. And I think the other thing I want to make sure everybody remembers is current RPO does have some residual effect from those FY'23 execution challenges. It's not the major part of it but that does also weigh on the growth as we go through this year.\nRob Owens: Thanks for the color.\nBrett Tighe: Rob.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Roger Boyd at UBS.\nRoger Boyd: Great. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to push a little bit further on macro. I think it sounds like the biggest impact is really just around deal sizes. But wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing through the first month of May or the first month of 2Q that's really changed. If you think about sales cycles, pipeline, et cetera, how does that kind of factor into the guidance you've laid out? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, pipeline is solid. It's interesting. If you look at the -- like the analytics we look at over the whole of the business, that's where you get that average deal size ticking down. When you just have customers -- when you just have conversations with customers and the kind of the qualitative aspects of how important identity is and being interested in this approach we have, which is hey, you can get Customer Identity and Workforce Identity and Privileged and Governance from one customer very positive conversations. Also more on the qualitative side, we saw a lot of deals or maybe more than normal. We always have some deals that slip out of an end of the quarter, but we had more than normal slip out this quarter. And I guess that's not great. But on the positive news, we've had many of those close in the first quarter of -- or in the first few weeks of Q2 here. And I think what that tells me is that it's more confidence, that it's really just, it's not a question about the value of identity or the long-term strategic nature of what we're selling. It's more of what every company is doing. Okta, we're doing this ourselves internally. We're really asking for scrutiny on every purchase. We're trying to be more efficient. We're making sure -- customers are making sure they're getting ROI. They have a plan for ROI. There's maybe another level of budgetary approval that we didn't see before. And it does slow some things down, but the projects are still moving. And when I talk to CIOs of some of the biggest customers in the world, they say, hey, identity is going to help me be more secure. It's going to help me do more -- have a more efficient workforce. That's going to help me transform digitally, and it's something people are doubling down on and investing in. So I think it's -- you're seeing solid execution, a lot of macro uncertainty, but long-term, identity is going to be an important thing and we're going to be there to serve the market.\nDave Gennarelli: Great. Next question goes to Josh Tilton at Wolfe Research.\nJoshua Tilton: Can you guys hear me?\nTodd McKinnon: Hey, Josh.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey, guys. How are you?\nTodd McKinnon: Good.\nJoshua Tilton: Just a quick one for me, and I don't sorry to come back to the macro here but I just wanted to clarify. Brett, in the same sentence, you kind of said increased macro headwinds but then you also reverted to similar to Q4. So I'm just trying to understand, did the macro actually get worse from last quarter or did it stay the same?\nBrett Tighe: Yes. Yes, it definitely got worse. So what I remember about that is there's some similar trends to Q4 in terms of new business versus upsell mix being much more weighted toward upsells. That's been pretty consistent in terms of us seeing that, right? The contract duration continues to be a little bit lower than what we've historically seen. But some new trends that are coming around are what you heard me talk about around less seat expansions. And when I mean seat expansions, I mean both seat expansion on the workforce side of the house and also on the monthly active users side of the house in terms of customer identity. So we're seeing it broad-based across both products. The other area that we're kind of seeing it more broad-based is around from a geo perspective or a segment perspective, there's no one area where you're like, wow, it's really affecting it more there. It seems from what we can see in the data and everything that we're looking at, it really does feel much more broad-based at this point than it was maybe in the past or so now where we said in the previous couple of quarters ago, we said it's a little bit more small and medium-sized business. We're seeing it both enterprise and small and medium-sized business. So it definitely got worse over the quarter in terms of Q4 -- in Q1 sorry.\nJoshua Tilton: And just to finish the question was, if I look at the guidance for the full year that you guys are raising for revenue, does that assume that what you see today gets worse, kind of stays the same? And just maybe how should we think about the cRPO numbers for next quarter, maybe the year-over-year comps with Auth0 in the mix?\nBrett Tighe: Yes, absolutely. It does, in fact, assume that the macro does get worse, both on the current RPO side and on the revenue side. So obviously, when we think about the guidance, both of them have got that incorporated. So in terms of the compares, I mean, what you heard me say a second ago, there is some residual impact from the execution challenges we had in FY'23 in the current RPO guidance. But obviously, we're being thoughtful with how we're thinking about the balance of the year, given what we've seen in the macro and how it's developed over the last few quarters.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. One thing, quick thing there is Auth0 was in the comps last year, so that should be a like-for-like there.\nJoshua Tilton: Super helpful. Thanks guys.\nTodd McKinnon: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Josh.\nBrett Tighe: Thanks, Josh.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up Adam Tindle at Ray J.\nTodd McKinnon: Can't hear you, Adam.\nBrett Tighe: We can't hear you, Adam.\nAdam Tindle: There we go. Hey, Todd, I wonder if you could maybe opine on kind of a story that's going on with investors. We're seeing the quantitative metrics here, the NRR is in decline, the average deal size that you talked about is ticking down, but you've got more products to sell in each deal and at least to this qualitative story of perhaps we're in more of a commoditization cycle for core identity. Okta has never been the cheapest. I think you've been proud of that. Stiff competition, there's kind of this platform consolidation narrative across security broadly. So I just wonder if you could maybe talk about that being a premium product with the environment arguably changing. I wonder if you re-evaluate that premium product strategy. And if you could maybe comment on the pricing environment broadly and how to compete now versus years ago, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. We're -- we hear that narrative as well. And it's interesting, we don't -- we just don't see it in the data. The win rates remain strong. The -- I mentioned the average deal size ticking down a little bit, but the unit price stays -- the unit price we get has stayed consistent. So when we look at the data holistically and be rigorous at it and really something we do culturally, which is check our assumptions and make sure we're seeing the world as it is, we just don't see it. We think that -- that being the case, we think the right strategy is continue to build the best products for identity use cases broadly and package them and sell them as we sell them and make sure that we keep delivering that leadership position to the market. But listen, we're not, I mean, we want to win and we're rigorous in our analysis. And we do make sure we look at things with an open mind that we're executing the best strategy, but we think our strategy and approach, based on all the data and based on what we're seeing, not just quantitatively, too, but just qualitatively with the customer success we're seeing and the traction in our Customer Identity Cloud and the appeal of this, not just the best core access management product, but also this -- the IGA product, which is really off to a super strong start and Privileged Access is coming out and innovations with FastPass, we think we have a winning strategy and we'll keep executing it.\nAdam Tindle: And is there still an intent to replace Susan or is the management changes you talked about with Eugenio today, that is the new strategy, just to clarify? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: It's great. Thanks for asking. Yes, we are, I am still searching for a go-to-market president. That's a really important search. And in a lot of ways, we have the luxury of making sure we look everywhere and find a truly amazing candidate. And when you look at the people we're talking to, it's not -- there's not a lot of people in the world that have experience taking a company from $2 billion in ARR to $10 billion-plus, which is where we want to go over the next several years. So we have -- thankfully, the team that's in place is doing a great job, whether that's the Interim Chief Revenue Officer, John Addison or our marketing and customer success executive, Eric Kelleher, is doing an amazing job or Eugenio is taking on this role, which is really, really important. It's about how do we make Okta operationally excellent across all dimensions, including very importantly, the strategy and operations of the growth of go-to-market, which is an important component of that, including the automation projects and the technology, IT projects that have to come together to make that happen. It's adjacent to the president, a very important role, but we're going to find a great person for that president role, and I think we're on track to do that.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Sterling Auty at MoffettNathanson.\nBilly Fitzsimmons: Hey, guys. This is Billy Fitzsimmons on for Sterling Auty. I'll steer away from macro for a sec. How do you both think about Okta's opportunity in the generative AI space and the identity opportunity with the emergence of AI applications?\nTodd McKinnon: I have a big newsflash for everyone. I think AI is a big deal. And I think it's one of these things that is getting a lot of hype and is probably still underhyped. And I don't think it's like a -- it's come -- it feels like it's come on all at once, but it's really been a culmination of really a lot of important trends in the world, both just like the algorithmic advancements and what they're doing with originally what was TensorFlow and now the large language models in various domains and -- or it's the compute power, which everyone knows about or. The key thing, too, is just the data. If you think about the breakout application, it's ChatGPT. And ChatGPT really is relevant because of the compute and because of the algorithms, but really because it was trained on the Internet or 20-plus years of the Internet to be that training set for that model. So you have to have the data. So when we look at our own business, one of our huge, we have AI in our products, and we have for a few years, whether it's Threat Insights on the Workforce side or Security Center on the Customer Identity side, which look at our billions of authentications and use AI to make sure we defend other customers from like similar types of threats that have been prosecuted against various customers on the platform. Those products are great, and they'll get better with better algorithms and more data because we have the strategic advantage of having so much data, we can see the patterns. And we'll continue to add more products that take advantage of data and algorithms and compute. So that's -- I'm really excited about the potential. One of the ideas that we're working on that might be a typical use case of how someone like us could use AI is configuring Okta, setting the policy up for Okta across hundreds of applications on the Workforce side or 10 or 20 applications on the Customer Identity side with various access policies and rules about who can access them and how they access them. Be pretty complicated to set up. But we've actually been prototyping using AI to auto-generate that configuration and that policy setup so a customer doesn't have to start from scratch. They can see what 18,000-plus other customers have done and then apply that quickly to their own configuration, decrease in the errors, increasing the speed to value. So that's an idea of in the products, how it could be maybe a nonobvious use case. And then the other one we're excited about is if you zoom out and you think this is a huge platform shift, it's the next generation of technology. So that means that there's going to be tons of new applications built with AI. It means that there's going to be tons of new industries created and industry has changed. And there's going to be a log-in for all these things. You're going to need to log on to these experiences. Sometimes it's going to be machines, sometimes going to be users. That's an identity problem, we can help with that. So in a sense, we're really going to be selling picks and shovels to the gold miners. In fact, you all know that OpenAI is a customer and our Customer Identity Cloud is the login for ChatGPT. So that's, I would say, a very exceptional example of a successful application in the extreme. But there's going to be thousands of these types of applications and they all need identity and we're here to serve as that supplier to them. So that's another positive trend on our business I think.\nBilly Fitzsimmons: Perfect. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up we have Rudy Kessinger from D.A. Davidson.\nRudy Kessinger: Thank you for taking my questions. I guess coming back to the guide, the cRPO guidance, certainly the implied second half revenue guide, Brett implies growth exiting the year in the mid-teens, if not maybe even the low teens. And I guess, what can you guys, on the one hand, you talked about improvement in metrics with the sales force productivity and selling CSC, et cetera. I guess, what more do you have to do to maybe put a stock to the deceleration in growth even against a more difficult macro and maybe even potentially reaccelerate growth?\nBrett Tighe: Sorry I had -- my computer just froze. What was the question?\nTodd McKinnon: I can take it. I'm happy to take it. I think that there's -- first of all, there's -- we're always improving and trying to get better. And I think I made the comment that we're -- we've made a lot of progress on some of the execution issues we had last year. And we talked about sales attrition being healthy and tenure ramping and productivity of reps being in terms of selling CIC being positive. So we're still doing a lot of things to improve. And that's across the whole company, by the way, whether it's operationally improving our efficiency, our effectiveness, building better products, building products faster, better enablement, better go-to-market operations across the board. So we're going to continue to improve. I think the one in terms of like modeling and going forward, when we see a quarter of some of these trends turn the other way, whether it's mix of new business to upsell, whether it's deal size, as we mentioned, things like that, that's when we're really going to be comfortable that the macro is past us and the business can achieve greater than the guidance we've outlined.\nBrett Tighe: Yes. I would just also add to that, that I would say that we remain committed to this profitable growth concept, right? I mean, we've been talking about this for a while now, and you can see it in this quarter with the margins that we had, 24% margins. On the free cash flow side, 21-point improvement. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong as well. There was a huge improvement year-over-year. So it's not just, obviously, we want to grow as fast as we can but we want to grow responsibly and profitably as we move forward.\nRudy Kessinger: That's helpful. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Good afternoon. Can you maybe help us understand where we are with the sales transition, productivity levels? And maybe what's left to be done at this point? You referenced the sales conditions right here. Thank you.\nTodd McKinnon: Jonathan, just to catch people up. So we're really -- so that's three quarters into a big change on the clarifying of the positioning of the Workforce Identity Cloud and the Customer Identity Cloud. And that was -- we did that in Q2 of last year, kind of announced it, revealed it to the world in November, so into Q4. This is really the end of Q2 here is really the third quarter since it was publicly launched, kind of the fourth quarter since we started working on it internally. So that was a big milestone behind us. And when we look at evidence of that -- we look for evidence of that is resonating. One thing is just the qualitative conversations with customers, conversations with analysts in the market, industry analysts, et cetera, et cetera, and those are all going very well. Quantitatively, what we look at is we look at the numbers I mentioned over and over. It's how many sales reps have done Customer Identity Cloud deals. That's the big new product suite. Doing a deal in there is -- it demonstrates familiarity and capability to do it, it portends the future of do more so. That one has been trending positively and is really in a healthy place. That's a positive thing. That being said, the tuning of go-to-market and the running of the go-to-market machine on a global basis is something we're always improving, whether it's better top-level, more effective campaigns in terms of driving demand generation, whether it's just operationally, how we're prosecuting leads to opportunities, how the sales team has taken those opportunities and all the kind of the blocking and tackling of sales, the sales funnel and the sales machine, we're continuously improving that. I think -- but the big changes we made last year with that clarifying of the Workforce Identity Cloud and the Customer Identity Cloud positioning and some of the changes we talked through at that time. So I guess it's a tale of two things. It's getting those big rocks behind us. We're also continuing to make sure the go-to-market machine is humming as effectively as it can. But remember, you have a team that's every quarter, the retention is strong or the attrition is low, you have more ramp, and they've done more deals and they have more advice to do more deals and they're getting more and more productive, which is a positive signal.\nBrett Tighe: Yes. I would add one comment to that, Jonathan, which is the CIC trend that Todd talked about in terms of participation in the field is getting better. But the other thing that we saw in the quarter, which was a real strength was cross-selling across all products like whether it was like more WIC products to a WIC customer or a WIC customer buying CIC. It's actually one of the fastest-growing areas we had in the company and was definitely accretive to growth in the quarter. So we're very excited about that trend because that really shows you're getting a go-to-market organization that has a breadth of understanding of how to pitch the value and how to deliver value to our customer base.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you, Brett.\nDave Gennarelli: Next, we'll go to Ray McDonough at Guggenheim.\nRay McDonough: Great. Thanks. This is Ray McDonough on for John DiFucci. Maybe for you, Todd. How important is bringing IGA and PAM together to help maybe accelerate or ramp adoption of IGA? And I know it's early with the product, but do you see any delay or hesitancy in customers purchasing attention around IGA just waiting for the full release of PAM to put those two solutions together?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, it's a really insightful question. We don't. We actually -- the IGA has -- or OIG, Okta Identity Governance, which is our IGA product, has surpassed every goal we've had for it. Hundreds of customers using it. It surpassed the expectations in terms of -- we originally thought it would be more of a mid-enterprise. It's provided value to some of the largest companies as well. Another surprising thing is we thought it would be more, hey, greenfield, you don't have any IGA solution. This would be your first one. We actually see it -- we're seeing it be deployed alongside of some of the other solutions in the market, which is -- was a little bit unexpected, a positive thing. And then also even a few times, it's replacing solutions, which surprised me. I didn't think that -- I thought people once they had something installed, they wouldn't replace particularly the on-premise product with more of the modern new product that we have. So those are all positive trends. I actually think -- I don't think that people are waiting at all for the integration between -- to go with IGA, for the integration between IGA and Privileged. I do think that the flip will be true. I think that the fact that Privileged has integration to IGA will accelerate Privileged because that's something that hasn't happened before. Privileged resources were really around -- or Privileged Access management was really around the admin accounts and dealing with those things and somewhat of a silo. And what we're doing is you can have the same kind of access certification, the same kind of reporting and visibility across all your resources that servers, Kubernetes and you get the governance capabilities with that. So I think there'll be a tailwind there where we're not seeing the hesitancy the other way to -- although I think there could be an upside, but we're just not seeing a lot of people waiting for -- to go with IGA because of the Privileged not being there quite yet.\nRay McDonough: Thanks.\nDave Gennarelli: Next we'll go to Adam Borg at Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just on the federal vertical. You guys recently talked about Okta for US military. That seems like an interesting announcement. Talked about a growing partnership with Arasoft. So maybe how to think about the federal opportunity more broadly and where you're investing the most there. Thanks.\nBrett Tighe: Yes, federal . Go ahead, Todd.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, I was going to say it's really an important vertical for us. And we've had a -- you mentioned the DoD military, the instance for the DoD, which is the dot military instance. And then also, we achieved FedRAMP High recently, and these are all huge tailwinds to that important business for us. The government is -- and it's not just federal, by the way, it's the state and local as well. Some of our sizable opportunities over the last couple of quarters and over the next few quarters are actually with states, states doing big transformation projects. And yes, we have a big goal and target on federal this year. It's something we invested a lot in and we're very excited about the potential for that to achieve and even overachieve its targets.\nBrett Tighe: Yes, I would just add to that in the sense that if you remember last time we spoke for FY'23, federal specifically was the fastest-growing segment we had across the company, and that's a direct result of the focus we put on in FY'23. And I think that's created a lot of momentum for us as we're going to move through this year. I mean, you saw the US Air Force Recruiting Service sign on for us as a customer. So we definitely are excited about the opportunity in the long run.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. That's a lot.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Stefan Schwarz at Wells Fargo.\nStefan Schwarz: Hey, I'm on for Andy Nowinski. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one. You mentioned the PAM is in beta. Any early customer feedback from that?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. It's pretty early. It was released, I think, into beta like six eeks ago. But, yes, they're digging in and there -- a lot of these customers are -- they were familiar with the road map, and so they kind of -- they've really kind of honed their evaluation to be really on the sweet side of the product, which is dynamic environments that use a lot of containers, use a lot of cloud instances, want to control those types of environments with the same types of access management primitives like passwordless, like anti-phishing, access management capabilities that the core Okta platform provides. So they're really kind of perfect fits for this. So it's off to a very good start. It's early. We expect that the next wave of customers will be much broader, and it will also be customers that maybe weren't as hand-selected so we'll get a lot of good signal out of this next wave as well.\nStefan Schwarz: Got it. And then just real quick, any timing on when you might see the next wave of customers?\nTodd McKinnon : So I would -- instead of the exact time on that, I would focus on the fact that we're on track for the end of the year GA.\nStefan Schwarz: Okay. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up is Joe Gallo from Jefferies.\nJoseph Gallo: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Todd, you've mentioned CIAM being a key focus area this year. Just any quantitative or qualitative update on the performance of CIAM versus Workforce. And then maybe just a quick update on the sales force's comfortability selling CIAM. Thanks again.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. The 1 -- it is something importantly we watch, and I mentioned a couple of times that just kind of qualitatively, as I have conversations with customers and I do my -- I talk to a lot of customers, and I'm in a lot of both being the executive sponsor for big accounts for Okta but also working with deals and new customers. It's still a relatively small number, given the number of 18,000-plus customers and the number of deals we do in a quarter. So I do like to compare -- the actually quantitative aggregate data with my qualitative data. But qualitatively, the interest is pretty similar across both. There's big Customer Identity customers, there's important Workforce customers that want us to -- are going through strategic transformations and want to make sure that we're going to be there to support them for massive rollouts and huge investment in Okta. And then when you look at the -- but when you look at the aggregate number, the 1 that's really important is just the number of sales reps doing these CIC deals. And that's just more of, more repetition. That's going to lead to, I think, a really balanced business going forward and a go-to-market organization that can sell both products at scale. The one thing I will say in terms of qualitative as well -- or it's quantitative as well is that the macro impacts we're talking about, whether we say smaller than average or decrease in the average deal size or it's the tilt toward upsells versus new business, these are across both use cases. These are consistent across Workforce and Customer. We don't -- you might want to -- one of the ideas we had is it would be impacting 1 more than the other and we don't see that. It's consistent across that, which is also a reason why when you think about market dynamics or pricing or competitive, the two businesses have very different competitive sets. And it's interesting that all these trends we track are impacting both the CIAM, which also gives us confidence that it's macro-related.\nBrett Tighe: Yes, I just would add to that in the sense that if you heard my comment a second ago around our cross-selling across the business, whether it's intra-cloud or inter-cloud, was really good. One of the bright spots in that was the cross-selling of CIC into other types of customers. So it's another good positive sign inside what we're seeing in the execution of the organization.\nJoseph Gallo: Thanks.\nDave Gennarelli: Next, we'll go to Fred Havemeyer at Macquarie.\nFred Havemeyer: Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. And I'm sorry to return the conversation back to macro, but --\nTodd McKinnon: No worries. No worries at all.\nFred Havemeyer: I'm hoping to get a better picture or a more intuitive understanding about kind of where the macro headwinds are originating. So wanted to ask if you could elaborate about just, is this something that could be coupled perhaps the layoffs and hire increases that are ongoing ubiquitously across a whole range of markets? Or is this something perhaps more related to just general cost controls within organizations or is it something completely different?\nBrett Tighe: I would say it's a mix of both of what you just said. Because when you look at the Workforce Identity Cloud, you heard me talk about seat expansions. Well, the seat expansions are really our customers' employees, right? They don't have as many as they expected so they're not going to buy more, or maybe they have less than they had when they originally contractually agreed with us. So -- and that's happening, by the way, on the CIC side, the Customer Identity Cloud side as well. We're seeing the commitments to and expectations around their own websites or their own customer-facing applications being a little less so. So we're seeing that component, but then we're also seeing, if you look at contract durations, seeing how they're a little bit shorter than normal. I think people are just being more thoughtful about the uncertainty out there in the macro. That's all the quantitative we can see. There's also the qualitative that we hear from the field of budgets being reduced a little bit or, hey, the CFO and procurement being a little slower to close deals because they want to be thoughtful about how they enter into contracts. So we're seeing a variety of those things of what you just said, Fred. So I think you've got it spot on.\nFred Havemeyer: Okay. Thank you for the context.\nBrett Tighe: No problem.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Shrenik Kothari at Baird.\nShrenik Kothari: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So on the positive side I know Brett mentioned that you guys have seen strong growth in cross-sell across products. So I'm assuming it's both Customer Identity as well as IGA beginning to move the needle in terms of ACV. But I mean, since you guys mentioned about the future of Identity Governance, you guys are seeing almost one-thirds or more of the total kind of Workforce Identity Cloud spend going to OIG. So just wondering, and I think you touched upon it in terms of essentially, the majority of the business still being greenfield, but the replacements are also in terms of your ability to win and RFPs exceeding your expectations. So can you provide some more color there? Has there been more replacements compared to last quarter in terms of the mix, how that's trending? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, I think, it's a really good -- it's some really good questions there. I'll separate the kind of aggregate statistics of the healthy cross-sell and upsell numbers. So this is inclusive of you have a Workforce. You add multi-factor. You have single sign-on, you add advanced multi-factor or governance. So there's -- it's upsell products within Workforce. It's also upsells -- sorry, cross-sells within Workforce. It's also cross-sells where you have Workforce and you buy Customer or you buy Customer -- you have Customer and you buy Workforce. So that's just in the data holistically. So IGA, it's off to a strong start, but it's only in the hundreds of customers so it's very optimistic, but I don't -- it's not really moving that needle yet. We think it will over time. But it is off to a very fast start. And I think one thing that -- just to clarify what I said, I think that our assumption was that it would be more greenfield. It's a very -- it's a modern IGA. It's super integrated with access management. It's -- it covers all of the basic use cases and all the integrations that a customer that is more cloud-centric and modern in their technical architecture want to need -- would want or need. And the -- so I thought it would be more greenfield. The surprising thing is that it's being installed next to legacy deployments. So even though they chose a legacy vendor, for whatever reason, they couldn't expand it fast enough, they didn't get the value or it didn't get as broad as they want it to. They're putting Okta Identity Governance next to it for kind of and surrounding it in that. I don't -- we have seen a couple of replacements, but I think full rip-outs of an IGA solution are going to be relatively rare. I think once people get these things installed, they work and they don't touch them. But we also think there's a big opportunity. I mean, the IGA market right now is not that big. We think with a great product like Okta Identity Governance, we can make it much, much larger. And that's why these early trends are super exciting.\nShrenik Kothari: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nDave Gennarelli: Next up, let's go to Scotiabank.\nJoe Vandrick: This is Joe Vandrick on for Patrick Colville. Can you hear me okay?\nTodd McKinnon: Hey, Joe. Loud and clear.\nJoe Vandrick: All right. So going back to the governance product, adding an incremental 33% or so to customer spend for those who adopt it, should we expect a similar uplift for customers who adopt PAM once that's rolled out? Thanks.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, I think that's realistic. We want to see it in the market and see it contribute that because that one-third increase is based on looking at customers in the market, hundreds of customers. So when we look at PAM right now, we see kind of the pricing of it and we model it out. We think it could be that -- contribute that much. But we want to see it actually before we're as confident as what we're seeing in Okta Identity Governance.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Madeline Brooks at BofA.\nMadeline Brooks: Hey, guys. Can you hear me okay?\nTodd McKinnon: Loud and clear.\nMadeline Brooks: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just oneclarifying question and then one quick follow-up. I guess, on the cRPO guide, if I'm thinking about the impact from Auth0 integration last year, can you just give us some parameters on how large that is? I mean, a 1% impact is very different from 5% impact.\nBrett Tighe: You mean like the impact associated from the Customer Identity Cloud selling last year?\nMadeline Brooks: Right. And some of the selling issues and how that's reflected in cRPO growth?\nBrett Tighe: Look, I couldn't give you the exact percentage. I mean, obviously, it creates a headwind for us, both on revenue and cRPO because we didn't execute as well as we want. But obviously, as you've heard today, we feel like we've turned the corner on a lot of those execution issues and we've actually had quite a nice quarter, both top line and bottom line. So, yes, I can't give you an exact number.\nMadeline Brooks: Okay. Got it. No worries. And then on the customer side, too, I mean, I know you said that there's no -- you guys aren't seeing an impact, a difference from macro impact on that. But given that customer is a little bit more of a transformational project.If we think forward as to how the year is going to go, are you forecasting any slowdown on the Customer side because of that? And if you look forward to it, Brett, you mentioned that you are having a little bit more conservative going forward. So where is that conservatism coming from? Is it still assuming you're going to see similar impacts on both product lines?\nBrett Tighe: The guidance right now assumes it's -- it gets worse in both product lines because we are seeing the impact in both product lines. So that's really how we're thinking about it going forward.\nMadeline Brooks: Okay. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Keith Bachman of BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Good afternoon and thank you. I wanted to ask Brett for a second. If you could talk a little bit about the net retention rate, the latest 12 months number. And so presumably, this quarter was a pretty big step down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But how should investors be thinking about the net retention rate as we look out over the next couple of quarters? And related to that, you've talked about IGA and PAM and presumably some other products being interesting to customers. And so if the macro just stays the same or maybe gets a little bit worse, if we think over the next two to four quarters, how might these products really be able to help the mix or the upsell, if you will? Because what I think investors are really struggling with is the cRPO guide is candidly deemed to be disappointing. But the larger question is, is that 14% to 15%, is that the bottom or does it get worse from here?\nBrett Tighe: Yes, okay. So in terms of net retention rate, the decline quarter-over-quarter from 120 to 117, like we spoke about previously, we did expect the number to decline, and they were for two reasons. If you remember last time, I talked about macro worsening, and we basically spent most of this call talking about macro worsening. So it definitely kind of played out like we thought it was. You can see it due to seat expansion, stats that we talked about today. The other thing we talked about is why we thought it was going to drop throughout FY'24 was around FY'23 customer adds. We didn't add as much new business in new customers in FY'23, thus makes it less customers to upsell into in FY'24. Both of those obviously came to fruition, 117 is where we landed. But the thing that I want to make sure everybody is very clear on is that the gross retention rate has remained stable in that mid-90% range. And we do expect that to continue throughout the balance of FY'24. In terms of those two other factors, which basically influence your upsell rate, the upsell rate is basically the difference between net retention rate and gross retention rate, we do believe that there's a continued headwind through the year, and we do believe we tick down from here in terms of net retention rate through the balance of FY'24. Now to your question on OIG and PAM, yes, obviously, we're actively working that to have those offset, those seat expansions, but I mean, OIG, off to a great start, as you've heard Todd talk about. But the numbers are still small. We all need hundreds of customers versus 18,000-plus customers, right? And then PAM is only going GA at the very end of the year. So we'll see the effects from PAM more likely in '25 and '26. So that's how I would think about net retention going forward.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. The other thing, too, is that when you think about the products to potentially upsell, the Customer Identity or Workforce Identity, selling Workforce Identity to someone that has Customer or a customer that has some in the Workforce is a way bigger impact than PAM and IGA at this point. That could change next year or '26, but for this year, the big upsell opportunities are selling the other cloud.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. And just to finish off though, is there anything you want to say about the cRPO growth? I mean, can you say this was the bottom or is it just too hard to call at this point?\nBrett Tighe: We'll update you as we go. Obviously, it's a fluid macro environment and so we don't want to get too far out in front of ourselves at this point.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: I know we're a little bit past the top of the hour, but we'll go into overtime a little bit more here, try to get to a few more questions. So next, let's go to Gabriela Borges at Goldman.\nGabriela Borges: Hi. Thank you. I want to stay on the topic of net retention. Brett, could you remind us, what percentage or how do you think about net retention split between upsell? If you look back over the past couple of years, how much has seat count growth or classic upsell contributed to net retention versus how much is cross-sell today?\nBrett Tighe: So that was what I was saying earlier, which is seat expansion definitely was a headwind to growth and also a headwind to net retention in Q1. And we do expect that to continue to be a headwind as we move forward, given our lens on macro and what we're seeing. So cross-sell had a nice quarter, like you've heard us say, but it's really that seat expansion is really what we're seeing is -- and when I say seats, to be very clear, it's both seats on the workforce side and MAUs on the customer side. So we're seeing it in both sides of the business. And we do believe that continues to be a headwind throughout the balance of FY'24.\nGabriela Borges: Is there a way to think about what the typical magnitude of contribution would be in a normal year from classic upsell seat count and MAUs?\nBrett Tighe: It varies from year-to-year but it's been a mix between the two. It hasn't been like 90-10, one or the other, right? It's been a mix between the two.\nGabriela Borges: Okay. Thank you.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Eric Heath at KeyBanc.\nEric Heath: Thanks, Dave. Todd, Just a question for you, I mean, Microsoft last week at their Build Conference announced kind of a new program or a new product around CIAM. So just curious to get your initial thoughts here on kind of that product and maybe how that may alter the competitive landscape if you will?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, I'm not -- I didn't pay attention to it. I'm not familiar with that announcement so I can't comment on that specifically. But I do know that it's just -- they've tried customer identity stuff in the past. I think it's just pretty different than -- it's pretty different than -- their workforce identity picture is it's kind of like a identity as part of your e-mail. And the whole focus of their identity program really is to be identity for e-mail and then by extension, be identity for security. And it's just a pretty different motion than Customer Identity and having a great developer experience and having the integrations that you have to have on the customer identity side. So I think -- I don't know the specifics, but it's just a pretty different world and I think that's why we're pretty unique to have such scale businesses in both. By far, the biggest customer identity vendor, it's a pretty -- it's important to bring both to customers, but one of the reasons why it's so valuable from a company perspective from -- to be that vendor is because you have to really build two muscles to do it successfully, which is what we've done.\nEric Heath: Thanks, Todd.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Brian Wilcox at Cleveland.\nBrian Wilcox: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about the contribution you're seeing from cloud marketplace transactions and how you think about that channel longer term, given we're hearing many customers are using it as a way to work down cloud -- excess cloud commits?\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. We're definitely seeing that as well. The AWS Marketplace has been pretty successful for us. It's still relatively small in terms of our partner channels, but it's growing quite rapidly. And the same thing, it sounds like you've heard, we hear as well. Customers like they can spend their enterprise credits that they've purchased. They can spend it on Okta through the marketplace. That's pretty compelling to them. But I think there's a bigger reason why Amazon is a really good partner for us and customers use the marketplace. And that's because if a customer has Okta, that means that they're more likely to use a choice of cloud providers versus being locked into one. And that's -- I think that's why it resonates to not just Amazon but a lot of the partners that we have, whether it's -- we talked about the Google announcement, the Zoom announcement. One of our big value props is our independence and our neutrality. And some of that is just the way we build features and how they're not beholden to kind of shuttling certain technology to customers. But it's also the ecosystems and the partner's ability to work with us, whether it's Google Workspace or Amazon or Zoom we talked about or the hundreds and hundreds of other big scale technology vendors that have an interest in and they're having to be choice in an ecosystem we're ready and willing and capable partner for them.\nBrian Wilcox: Thanks.\nDave Gennarelli: Let's go to Matt Hedberg at RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg: Hey, thanks, guys. So there's been a lot of talk about better cross-sell and upsell within your base versus new logos. I'm curious, Todd, when you look at the new logo side, how do you think we could start to unlock the broader legacy identity, access management replacement? Like there's hundreds, if not billions of dollars, out there on the legacy side seemingly waiting to be sort of like unlocked.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes. It's -- so I think I've said this before, for folks that have listened to the calls and I've had the pleasure to meet and talk to. I think the biggest opportunity for Okta is really the mass -- which is coming, the mass movement of people to do security and identity from the cloud, whether that's on the workforce side, where the default in especially large organizations, the default is just to kind of do it in their own data center and do it on-premise, do it in their own office and their own -- they think about the old world of local area networks and VPNs. And on the customer identity side, it's just kind of build it yourself. So the -- I guess the good news and the bad news is that the good news is that it's changing. I guess the bad news is that, I think in cases the -- maybe people being more conservative with technology investments and some questions about the macro economy can slow down some of that big change that would lead them up to a place where they want to -- they've chosen so much modern SaaS applications or so much cloud infrastructure or so much security stack outside of their own firewall, that now they're going to choose a cloud-based identity provider. They might be, in some cases, more reticent to do that in a macro environment that's maybe softer. So what that means is that our strategy is really we look for companies and we look for opportunities that are going through change, whether it's -- they are adopting apps or they're adopting cloud infrastructure or they're maybe doing M&A, merging things together, divesting things, something that's a catalyst for change, and that's when we do very well. So I think how do you unlock that? Well, one thing you do is you keep having success with customers and you keep building great products and you keep building a company that can help customers when they're ready. And then the other part of it is just it's kind of inevitable. I mean, it's going to change. Technology is going to move forward. Companies are going to make these investments, and we're going to be there to provide the identity solution when they do.\nDave Gennarelli: Maybe we can get these last two quickly. We'll go to Peter Weed at Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. One of the things that I'm kind of taking out of some of your guidance and numbers here is -- and look I get that some deals slipped into the next quarter that you had anticipated to get in this quarter. But it looks like you have yourself kind of reaccelerating a bit into the next quarter and actually even more in the second half of this year. And it's modest, obviously, but hopefully, those are conservative and might imply that you've got some optimism for reacceleration. What's giving you that sense of optimism and continuing to kind of raise your full year guide and perhaps quarter-over-quarter acceleration in the second half?\nBrett Tighe: Yes. I mean, I think for us, when we're thinking about the guidance, I mean, I don't think we're getting overly aggressive here. I think we're obviously being prudent with the environment. And we've seen some good execution in the quarter. And so we're obviously balancing that off with the effect from the macro. So that's really how we're thinking about the guidance.\nDave Gennarelli: Yes. Let's take our last question from Param Singh.\nParam Singh: Hi. Thank you. This is Param Singh on for Ittai Kidron and thank you so much for squeezing me in. So firstly, I wanted to get a sense between the Customer Identity Cloud and the Workforce Cloud, how much of a cross-sell opportunity still exists. I mean, just trying to get a sense of out of the 18,000 customers, how many use bulk? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nTodd McKinnon: The -- I think the opportunity is huge. I think just the Customer Identity and Workforce Identity, if our existing 18,000 customers had both fully all the products in both clouds, would power success for many, many quarters.\nBrett Tighe: I would say, I would actually say years.\nTodd McKinnon: Yes, many, many quarters like all plus.\nParam Singh: Is there any way to quantify that? You have like 15%, 20%, 50%?\nTodd McKinnon: So it's interesting, so we've done some work on this. The tricky part about it is trying to uniformly, across 18,000 customers, quantify the Customer Identity side of it because you have to -- it's not like Workforce where you can say how many employees making assumptions about partners and contractors and then look at the spend. With customer, you have to kind of make a leap about when's the next ChatGPT or how much digital transformation are these industries going to go through broadly? So it's a little bit harder to calculate, but we know enough to know that it's -- if we execute, we have a big opportunity.\nParam Singh: And then the real quick follow-up is, do you think you're right-sized with the restructuring you had in the first quarter? Or do you think there's some more opportunity here to trim fat here and there?\nTodd McKinnon: We think the plan is in terms of the guidance and the profitability and the profitable growth, we think it's a good plan. We're always [indiscernible].\nParam Singh: You think you're right-sized at this time?\nTodd McKinnon: We think it's a good plan, yes.\nParam Singh: Okay. Thank you so much.\nDave Gennarelli: Well, great. We appreciate everybody attending in today. Before you go, I wanted to let you know that we'll be attending the Mizuho Cyber Summit virtual event on June 12th. We'll also be participating in several bus tours this June and we hope to see you at one of those events. So that's it for today's meeting. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can e-mail us at investor@okta.com.\nTodd McKinnon: Thanks, everyone.\nBrett Tighe: Thank you."
