        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Turbine Report Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that this event is being recorded. At this, I would now like to turn the floor over to Brian Bartholomew, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bartholomew: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Turbine fiscal year 2024 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call to discuss our results are CEO, Bill Stone; and CFO Barrett Garrison. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current assumptions, expectations, and beliefs including projected operating metrics, future products and services, anticipated market demand and other forward-looking topics. Although, we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance and some will inevitably prove to be incorrect. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, please refer to the documents we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures of our performance. Non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release for important information about the limitations of using non-GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial results to the most comparable GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Bill Stone.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Brian, and thank you all for joining our call tonight. I'm going to break my remarks into three areas. First, I want to summarize our December results. Second, I want to describe the current state of our technology migrations and operations and changes we are making to improve our execution. And finally, I want to discuss the progress we're making against the future opportunities, which are very encouraging. For the December quarter, we achieved $143 million of revenue, $25 million of EBITDA, and $0.15 of non-GAAP earnings per share. We finished in line with our outlook expectations for our HEP business, but were below our expectations for our ODS business. We experienced three unique issues in our ODS business late in the quarter that were the difference between coming in below versus above our overall outlook. First, despite our forecast in U.S. device sales, to continue facing headwinds year-over-year, they were even more disappointing than what our conservative expectations were. Secondly, we finalized the migration of our cloud hosting platform late in the quarter. The good news is that this is a major milestone is now complete. However, some elements of our software that were working fine on our prior platform were not performing to the same on the new platform for a few weeks. These issues have now been fixed. And finally, we made some changes to our AI machine learning models for the holidays to drive improved engagement from our customers. The good news is that the engagement happened, but it happened at the expense of advertisers willing to pay more money to be on the platform for the holiday season and less focused on engagement. Combined, these three things were the difference between our results being below versus above our outlook. I'll discuss later in my remarks what we are changing to improve our execution going forward. But we do view all three of these issues as temporary in nature and not structural. From a segment perspective, our AGP or ad tech business showed sequential growth driven by improved eCPMs rates from our advertisers, despite our sunsetting of our legacy AdColony exchange. And now we are fully operational on our consolidated DT exchange. We are also now seeing growth from our new features, such as SDK bidding, contributing more material revenues to our business. Bigger picture, we are seeing demand and advertisers return, which is much improved from 12 months ago. In particular, our brand business experienced more than 25% sequential growth, despite one of our largest brand advertisers having their own temporary internal issues that impacted their spend on ours and others' networks. I'll provide more color later in my remarks on how we will continue to grow and scale our AGP business. The ODS business declined by 2% in the quarter, driven by short-term issues described above. With one US carrier exception that was only marginally up, our US operators had declined in devices from the prior quarter, which is unusual, given it was the holiday selling season. We have heard some recent encouraging reports from chipset suppliers on future device volumes, which tend to be lead indicators for future demand. So we are hopeful for better trends into the future. But for now, it is a major headwind, and it is reflected in our guidance for the March quarter. In addition to this, we are working to expand our device pipeline. I'm pleased to announce that we are expanding our relationship with Motorola with more devices in more countries, and also our relationship with ONE Store in Korea that will add nearly 40 million devices with SingleTap capability. Our pipeline remains robust, and we look forward to sharing more device supply opportunities into the future. Improving revenue per device outside of the United States to mirror where we are seeing in the device growth is a top priority for us. We also made progress with different advertisers on SingleTap in the quarter as we continue to expand with new contracts and new advertisers. We are not yet live with our large social media partner pilot. It is not any operational or technical issue preventing us from launch, but a final administrative issue that is being worked on their side. The relationship with that party continues to be positive and becoming more strategic, but we understand the frustration we are all feeling on translating this enthusiasm into revenue. I want to spend a few moments describing the changes we are making to improve our short term execution that will drive future growth. Our issue is unique and it is neither the what or the why. We are confident that we are working on the correct items as we can demonstrate product market fit and also how to make money on those things we are prioritizing. We also have a very clear vision on the why we are here. Digital Turbine can be a major disruptive force in the alternative app distribution with our unique assets and subject matter expertise. Most companies facing headwinds suffer from one of those two issues. We are unique as those are not our issues. Rather, we have two things we need to do to improve our execution which will drive future growth and cash flow. The first is the material investment we are making on the modernization of our tech stack which impacts short term results and the second is how we are working to execute. We need to demonstrate the ability on how we ramp new things into the market at scale to replace the exited businesses and the headwinds described earlier in my remarks. Those require new systems, new processes and new leadership models. On the tech stack modernization, we have approximately 40% of our product and tech organization working on building for the future versus working on short-term, non-strategic revenues. We're seeing early positive results from these modernization activities with things like our exchange consolidation, our hosting migrations, new ERP systems, and so on now live in the market. But we still have much work to do as we are implementing a lighter, more modular version of Ignite, a new demand side platform, or DSP, new backend tools that will scale our AI and machine learning efforts on the platform, and so on. All of this work is mission critical to build a long-term company that will scale to all of our expectations, and we have made a conscious decision to prioritize this work. I want to be clear that it does come at the expense of a few items that could drive short-term revenue in EBITDA, but for long-term investors, I want to emphasize the importance of finishing the swing on these things, and you will see continued progress over the upcoming quarters as we are very close to completing these activities that have been in the works now, in some cases, for many years. In addition to the system level work, we're also changing our leadership model, our organizational structure, making some leadership changes, changing our internal processes for decision making, and finally, improving our focus on the things that are going to drive short and long-term growth. And as we change these things, we are confident that the revenue and cash flow will follow as we know we have demand for our offerings in the marketplace. We are laser focused on these changes, which are being implemented in the current quarter, and these how things are working to change the what we're willing to be for the catalyst of returning Digital Turbine to a growth company. And what makes all of this worth it is the bright future. We are uniquely positioned with our on-device technology, including our first-party data, our AI machine learning tools, and SingleTap, plus our extensive publisher relationships and our operator and OEM relationships. We've launched our first alternative app distribution products, which we brand as DT Hub, with five operators here in the United States. We are leveraging our Aptoide investment and are generating revenue today. And as a reminder, our equity investment in Aptoide is now approximately 20%. We've also taken a minority investment in Flexion so we can improve our partnership on building great alternative app experiences as Flexion is a leading porting source for many alternative apps stores, such as Amazon, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and many others. And finally, many of you may have seen our press release from yesterday that we are also taking an equity stake in ONE Store. ONE Store is the largest alternative app store in Korea, and for context for investors not familiar with them, they generate more revenue than Apple does in Korea for the Apple App Store. We are beginning our relationship with ONE Store by enabling SingleTap on all of their 40 million Korean devices. And this has three benefits. One is that it will allow us to leverage our DSP to deliver friction free app downloads of alternative app versions to Korean customers. Secondly, it's a way for us to expand the scale of developed market device applied versus being constrained with the issues I mentioned here in the United States. And finally, we'll look to enhance our partnership with ONE Store into the future outside of Korea and combined with our Aptoide and Flexion relationships, we have the building blocks to be a dominant force in the alternative app market. And as a reminder for investors, the Digital Markets Act or DMA will be launching in early March in the EU, and we would encourage investors to pay close attention to the launch and the opportunities that it will present. I also want to emphasize that the alternative app strategy is not just about new revenues, but perhaps more importantly, will also be a catalyst to return our current business to growth. Today, approximately 50% of our business is driven by user acquisition and 50% driven by in-app advertising. Our app providers want to find ways to acquire more users at lower cost with those alternative users, and we believe that this will open up new app providers to leverage our ad tech stack as part of this strategy, thereby driving more AGP or ad tech revenue growth. We are live today running both alternative app user acquisition campaigns and in-app advertising, leveraging our technologies into our current results. In other words, improving our present revenues and cash flows are both closely linked to the future strategy. To close out my preferred remarks, our future continues to be very exciting, but we need to improve our short-term execution and return our business to growth. We have many specific growth drivers from devices, products, media partners, and cost optimization activities in flight that will accomplish that this year. Those things are the things that are going to return DT to a growth company in the short term while we continue to pursue our very bright, longer term vision. And with that, that'll conclude my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Barrett to take you through the numbers.\nBarrett Garrison: Thanks, Bill. And good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue of $142.6 million in the quarter was flat sequentially and down 12% year-on-year. Within our on-device solutions, or ODS segment, revenues of $94.3 million were down 2% to prior year, December quarter. These results were below our expectations we provided on our November earnings call, largely due to further softening in U.S. carrier device volumes during the holiday season, even against our conservative outlet. Combined with the temporary execution issues, Bill referenced stemming from certain platform integration efforts. These headwinds were partially offset by continued strength from improved U.S. revenue per device growth year-on-year. Our content media revenues were slightly up sequentially in the quarter. And while this part of our business has experienced headwinds from the prepaid content media from a year-on-year comparison, this headwind was fully lapped in the December quarter. We're encouraged by both the developments of our new partnership that Bill shared and our robust pipeline, providing the opportunity to leverage our existing device footprint and grow revenues on new supply, particularly outside the U.S. In our app growth platform, or AGP business, Q3 revenues of $49.2 million, which performed in line with our guidance expectations, grew 6.5% sequentially and declined 27% over prior year. We saw improving signs of spend levels, particularly within brands, evidenced by greater than 25% sequential revenue increases. While the overall decline in AGP year-on-year continues to be impacted in the short term by the consolidation and exiting of certain legacy business lines that we have discussed previously, we're pleased that as of the beginning of this calendar year, the revenue lines have been integrated and fully operational onto our consolidated DT exchange. I'd reiterate Bill's earlier comment that despite the near-term headwinds, we're encouraged by the platform consolidations we're making to bring the businesses together and expect these actions to have a positive return on our future growth. Our consolidated gross margin was 45% in Q3, which was down 180 basis points sequentially from Q2 and compares to 50% from Q3 in the prior year. Sequentially margins were influenced by modest ODS product mix shifts, where we experienced an increase in the mix of certain lower margin products. Last year's Q3 results also included the benefit of a contractual revenue share adjustment with an ODS partner, not repeated in this quarter. Within AGP, we saw strength year-on-year in expanding margins of 500 basis points from improvement in overall brand margins and favorable product mix within the segment. As a reminder, while gross margin rates can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, we generally anticipate long-term margin expansion as we continue to execute on our gross strategies. We remain disciplined with expenses, and cash operating expenses were $38.8 million in Q3, a reduction of 6% from prior year, and represented 27% of revenues in the quarter. In the period, we incurred lower than normal performance compensation expenses, and total GAAP operating expenses were $72.9 million, which were up 4% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by business transformation costs that we've discussed previously. Lean to the initiatives focused on integrating the technology platforms and back office systems across our assets. While the recent periods have incurred increased costs due to the completion of these efforts and new growth initiatives, we expect both the efficiencies and growth to begin to be reflected in our results throughout fiscal 2025 and beyond. During this phase, we remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are encouraged by the savings we're realizing from these platform consolidations. Turning to profitability, our adjusted EBITDA of $25.4 million in the quarter declined $2.2 million sequentially and was down from $40 million in the prior year, driven primarily from lower revenues and partially offset by a reduction in cash OpEx. Our EBITDA margin of 18% compared sequentially to 19% in the September quarter. Given the inherent operating leverage in our business model, we expect the active focus on expense measures and integration efforts we are taking will strengthen the platform as we return to growth and enable a greater portion of those dollars to fall to the bottom line. In the quarter, we achieved non-GAAP adjusted net income of $15.7 million or $0.15 per share as compared to $30 million or $0.29 per share in the third quarter of last year. As compared to prior year, we incurred greater interest expense driven by rising rates and partially offset by lower outstanding debt balance. Our GAAP net loss was $14.1 million or a negative $0.14 per share based on 103.3 million diluted shares outstanding compared to prior year net income of $4.1 million or $0.04 per share. $14.1 million in free cash flows generated for the quarter enabled us to execute three with $49 million in cash after paying down an additional $10 million in debt using free cash flow from operations to further deleverage our debt position. Our debt balance into the quarter at $376 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. Also, in support of the key growth initiatives we've discussed, specifically around the pursuit of our alternative app store, strategic opportunity, and realizing the benefits from consolidating and modernizing our tech platforms, we recently amended our credit facility to provide additional flexibility and to align our capital requirements with the overall business needs. With these enhancements, we are confident in our ability to execute on our growth plans, and we continue to focus on balancing growth opportunities and cash flows to optimize financial performance and long-term enterprise value. Before covering our outlook, I wanted to provide some visibility into our guidance assumptions. Within our revenue guidance, we anticipate the headwinds associated with volume device declines to continue into Q4, principally on U.S. operators. While we believe future devices trends should improve, we've seen accelerating declines early in the March quarter, and at this time have limited visibility to the performance of the recent Samsung flagship device launch, and therefore we have further tempered our ODS volume expectations. We are optimistic about the future revenue growth from new partners and the successful execution against our pipeline in FY25. However, we do not expect material new revenues from these partner launches in our March quarter. I'd also point out as a reminder that in addition to the typical historical seasonal sequential impact experienced in Q4, with the exchange platform migration now completed, there will be approximately a $4 million in sequential revenue migration headwind from the completed exchange platform consolidation in Q4. And as we've highlighted previously, we're encouraged by the future benefits of this integration. Now let me turn to our outlook. We currently expect revenue for full year fiscal 2024 to be between $547 million and $553 million, and adjusted EBITDA to be between $90 million and $94 million, and non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $0.50 and $0.54, based on approximately $104 million diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 25%. With that, let me hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Darren Aftahi from ROTH MKM.\nDarren Aftahi: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just to clarify, if I may. I know the first one may not be an easy one to answer, but it seems like the device headwind is pretty persistent. I'm just kind of curious, are there any kind of green shoots you're seeing in the market? I know, Barrett, you've made some comments about accelerated declines in the U.S. But any kind of sense for when this kind of reverses itself? To, Bill, your comments about the tech stack, I'm just kind of curious, when are we going to be fully complete with implementation of that? And the just lastly, on the open app store initiatives and some of the stuff you're doing and investing in, when do you think that's going to start to have an impact on your P&L in a more material way? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Yes, thanks, thanks, Darren. I'll jump in on those and Barrett can provide any color, on the device headwinds. Yes, here in the United States, we saw a double digit year-over-year declines with our U.S. partners, which was something that we weren't expecting that precipitous of a decline, even though we'd forecasted one. So that continues to be an issue for us. And as Barrett referenced in his comments, January was off to a slow start, which reflects some of the things you saw in our outlook. The first weekend was encouraging for the S-24, although weekend does not make a trend. We'll see, but we want to make sure that we're being extra cautious regarding that. Based on some of the comments we've heard from chipset suppliers, it sounds like those device supplies will get better as the year goes on. Also, as we start seeing anniversary and out of three year anniversaries of lease contracts here in the United States on both Apple and Android devices from the US operators. I think we'll also be helpful. And then the thing for us is rather than get focused on those uncontrollables, what can we control? Well, we can control getting more devices in places like Korea that I mentioned. We can also expand our relationships with some of our other partners. We can take advantage of a pretty attractive competitive environment right now with bringing on new device supply. So we're really focused on doing that right now versus being relying upon some of the operators here in the United States. On the second question regarding the tech stack, it's going to be rolling. So every quarter you're going to see improvements from us. My expectation is it over the next 12 months that it'll be done. But you're going to see material improvements in the next quarter when we get on the call and in the following quarter and the following quarter and so on. It's a super high priority for us because in order to get to the business that we all want to get to a real scalable business, we've got to create a lighter, more modular tech stack, be able to take advantage of all the data science and learnings on that. And those things are in flight. And I'm pleased that we're making good progress. The issue is it's just right now; it's cannibalizing some very, very short-term issues where we could perhaps have some improved revenues, but it's absolutely not the right thing to do to just get too focused on the short-term and the expense of where we want to go with the business. And then finally on the App Store P&L, it is already in our business. We're already seeing rough, let's call it roughly a seven figure run rate of revenues from the alternative App Store business. I mentioned my remarks that we're running now campaigns through our pipes in terms of on the ad tech side as well as the in-app purchasing side and the user acquisition side. So this is not academic. It is early days as we get into 2024, I think you're going to see it to be a more material growth driver and begin building each quarter for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Dessouky from Bank of America.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi guys, thank you for taking my question. I was intrigued by your partnership and your investment in ONE Store. And I was hoping that you could talk about the economics of the deal. For example, what's the fee structure like, price per install, revenue share, things like that. And then secondly, what part of the consumer journey are you going to be involved in with regards to, I guess Korean customers. Is it just going to be the app install, or the in-app ads or potentially the in-app purchases as well?\nBill Stone: Yes, sure, Omar. Yes. So we're viewing our relationship with ONE Store, this really phase one of something that we were planning to do something bigger with those guys as we get into the future. And I think that as we, as the Digital Markets Act becomes live over the next 30 days or so, we're looking forward to really collaborating with them in the EU with the opening up of Google Play Store and Apple Store there. So I'd kind of stay tuned for something more strategic, more tactically in Korea, we've got to really do three things. We've got to number one; we've got to show that we can improve our dice biomes as I just answer on the prior question from Darren. And this helps us get our tech on about 40 million devices in Korea immediately, we can do that kind of as one fell swoop. Number two is we can drive user acquisition now with SingleTap, so we can be able to acquire more users into the ONE Store with those alternative apps leveraging our DSP and our ONE Store capabilities and a friction freeway for Korean customers. And then number three, we can work with the local app publishers in Korea and then get our own in-app advertising tech stack onto those, whether those are games or other types of applications and now it provides a new revenue stream force on our AGP side. So those are really the things that we're focused on. I am not obviously going to disclose any specific terms of how we're working the revenue with ONE Store other than say that I think it's a good win-win partnership for both sides.\nOmar Dessouky: And could I just ask as well, how should we think about the strategic value of these deals kind of coming together, right? You have the Aptoide, you have ONE Store. How do we think about synergies and the strategic value across regions and with multiple assets now?\nBill Stone: Yes, I think what's important for investors is if you believe that the alternative app store space is going to grow and be extremely disruptive over the upcoming years, which obviously we believe that, we believe we're uniquely positioned in partnering with the companies that continue to bring the capabilities because in order to enable this, there's a lot of things behind the scenes that have to happen, whether that's porting the apps into the alternative versions, managing the payments, doing it in a friction freeway with customers, having the publisher relationships to do multi-variants, I can go on and on about all the different things. But anybody that wants to do that, whether it's us direct or whether it's with other mega cap tech companies that have ambitions to go do this, there's a lot of those plumbing and electricity things that have to happen that make us super uniquely positioned to go out and help enable that. So now having these relationships with these companies all together is something that I think is going to make it easier for a one-stop shop for any app publisher to come to what we're doing to be able to solve the single biggest issue they have on their P&L, which is the egregious 30% tax that is getting paid to the two that are running the duopoly today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Day from B Riley Securities.\nDan Day: Yes, guys, thanks for taking the question. So Bill, in the prepared remarks you talked about changes in leadership and new org structure. Just it would be great if you could elaborate on that are you planning to bring in totally new people to run certain business lines, just sort of switching around positions or reports. It should be good to get a sense of what you're looking to accomplish with those changes.\nBill Stone: Yes, absolutely. I think the biggest issue we need to improve our execution is just getting alignment around the organization. So we need to make faster decisions. We need to have clearer accountability in what we're driving right now. So one of the things we're going to be doing is moving our business into a GM model where we'll be able to have clearer accountability to make results and drive the short-term profit and loss for different business lines each quarter. So we're making leadership changes to accomplish that, but this is really about us just getting better focus externally with our customers and better alignment internally between our different functions. And so we've got to change what we're doing and we've done a nice job assembling the companies, the legacy companies we've acquired and now have standardized a lot of things of how we've worked versus the legacy DT way versus the AdColony way versus the fiber way and so on. So now we're at a point and now where we can take that standardization and now decentralize that standardization out that's closer to customers and have clear accountability internally to who's making decisions. So what we're doing is really aligned around that.\nDan Day: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just for me, you've consistently said that US RPD is sit around over $5 for the last few quarters. Has that helped pretty steady even if devices have been a lot softer than you thought?\nBill Stone: Yes, device RPDs have been pretty consistent. They were marginally down in the December quarter from the September quarter and that was 100% driven by those two execution issues I mentioned earlier in my remarks. If you take out those two issues, it would have accrued it again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Stoss from Craig-Hallum.\nAnthony Stoss: Hey, Bill, I just wanted to follow up on your comment about why the SingleTap trial wasn't live. You talked about administrative issues. Can you give us a little bit more color on that when you expect that to be resolved? And then I had a couple of follow-ups.\nBill Stone: Yes, sure, Tony. Yes, we, as we know, we've all been impatiently waiting for us to go live and we'd work through the kind of final tech and ops issues, yes, that may be confident and talk about it. Yes, there's a final administrative decision that the partner wants to make with some other considerations that they're looking at bigger picture and they're going through that internal discussion right now. So as soon as that discussion is done, then I expect us to go live with the pilot. I don't have a timeline at least given our past here that I want to commit to on the call today, but I would just consider it to say it's important for both sides to work through that.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. Then maybe, this is probably more for Barrett, for your March guide, the down sequential revenues, can you break out how much of the decline was from ODS or your expectations versus AGP? Are they both down equally or is one worse than the other? Just a question.\nBarrett Garrison: Hey, Tony. Yes. Here's what I would say. We obviously don't guide by segment, but I would say our seasonality is that if you look back at our seasonality for AGP business, it's relatively constant. We got a little bit of headwind I mentioned on as we completed the consolidation of the exchange. The real factor that on the change is kind of an accelerating decline on the Q4 US devices that we've contemplated in our guidance.\nAnthony Stoss: Got you. And Bill, back to you. Just curious if you could talk about what you're seeing in the competitive environment. If one source is having issues or not, just what you expect, and then I had one last question after that.\nBill Stone: Yes, I think in the competitive environment, obviously there's been a lot of announced changes out there in the market for one of our competitors. So we're looking at that as an opportunity for our business, especially as we talked about this softness in US device supply. And while we expect that to rebound by some of the things, I was talking about with chipset suppliers and flagship devices and all that, we also have to take matters in our own hands. And so we're viewing some of those changes happen in the macroenvironment with some of the competitors as a positive for us. And there's a lot of encouraging things going on in the pipeline right now.\nAnthony Stoss: Got you. And then hopefully you can answer this or give everybody a sense. It's been a frustrating stock for some time. Numbers keep going down. When you look over the next 12 months, so fiscal 2025, would you expect at least revenue growth in ‘25 over ‘24?\nBarrett Garrison: Tony, your question around run rate growth?\nAnthony Stoss: No, just fiscal year 2025 revenue is your next, call it June through the next March quarter. Do you expect growth? Given everything that's going on in the tech stack and the issues that's created?\nBarrett Garrison: Yes, all the things we're working towards, all the things we have in our planning and execution that we talked about are to drive growth next year. And that would be the expectation.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to our CEO, Bill Stone, for any closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Yes, thanks everyone for joining the call tonight. We'll look forward to reporting on our progress against all the points we made on the call tonight. And we'll talk to you again on our fiscal ‘24 fourth quarter call in a few months. Thanks, and have a great night.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

I continue to be encouraged with our effort and execution uncontrollables and believe they will pay dividends in the future as we work through some of the uncontrollables with soft U.S. device sales and also being able to expand the reach of popular Chinese applications on our U.S. supply. I was also pleased with the tangible progress on a variety of capital investments against the future with new technology platforming, new ad tech capabilities, our hub initiative, alternative app distribution and SingleTap. We believe these investments will prove to be well-served against our future growth and also have the added benefit of being able to reallocate many of those resources against shorter-term revenue initiatives over the next few quarters to drive growth. I'll provide updates on those future growth drivers after providing some operational updates and commentary on the business. For the September quarter, we had $143 million of revenue, $28 million of EBITDA, $0.13 of non-GAAP earnings per share and our gross profit margins were 47%. Our EBITDA improved sequentially driven by reduced controllable costs. Barrett will talk about the details in his remarks, but it was positive to also see us reduce our debt in the quarter by $22 million, driven by improved sequential free cash flow. From a segment perspective, despite continued soft device sales here in the United States, our on device business grew revenue sequentially to just over $99 million. Operationally, I was pleased with our improvement of revenue per device or RPD in the U.S., which continues to be over $6 for all of our partners and for two of our U.S. postpaid carriers we almost hit $10 for the first time. Over the past five years, our RPDs have accretive from just over $2 in fiscal year '20 to $3 in fiscal year '21 to $4 in fiscal year '22 to $5 in fiscal '23 and today is over $6. We continue to see strong demand for our platform both from advertisers and new products contributing more revenue to each device. Expanding global demand to our U.S. device supply has also been a big driver of those improved RPD results as U.S. demand is less than 20% of revenues on our U.S. supply despite some continued headwinds on being able to run all the Chinese media dollars that we have budgets for. While we expect the current quarter to experience continued device softness here in the U.S. going into 2024 we will be expanding our global telco and OEM relationships to help offset weakness in device sales from our existing partners. As an example to this point, many of you've seen our announcement with Xiaomi that is focused on growing in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific and we're also adding new operator in Latin America in this current quarter and our global pipeline remains robust. Regarding our content media business, as we've discussed on prior calls, we expected it to trough in the June quarter and that is what happened as we showed sequential growth quarter-over-quarter in September. On our App Growth Platform segment or AGP business, we finished with $46 million in revenues. We're seeing sequential improvements in eCPMs rates on both our brand demand and DSP from advertisers and in particular it was encouraging to see our brand business continue to grow nearly 10% sequentially as we saw eCPMs improved by nearly 25% in the quarter. The macro market has stabilized and our execution is improving but there's still on some uncertainty baked into our outlook given some of the global macro and geopolitical issues others have mentioned in their commentary. Our exchange offer wall business was roughly flat in the quarter and the exchange business continues to be well diversified globally with approximately 37% of our publishers in North and South America, 51% in Europe, Middle East, Africa and 20% in Asia-Pacific. We have nearly completed our consolidation of multiple exchanges into a single DT exchange. The main benefit of this consolidation is the efficiencies and new products such as STK bidding that will helps - will help us capture more ad dollars from companies such as The Trade Desk, Google and Amazon into the future. And as part of that migration, which will be complete in the current quarter, we've also chosen not to migrate some of the many thousands of long tail publishers on the legacy exchanges over to the DT exchange, which will create headwinds on past comps even as we grow our DT exchange into the future. We've also beta launched our evolution of our Demand Side Platform or DSP that we brand as DT Direct. This allows us to have more intelligent buying and selling of ad dollars across the DT Network which means better margins and better return on ad spend for our customers as we can better leverage SingleTap, our first-party data, data science machine learning and AI at better scale and performance than our legacy DSP. These enhancements mean that DT Direct will be a growth driver for us in 2024. In addition to leveraging SingleTap on the DSP, we continue to utilize it in many other ways across our Device Solutions as an enablement technology. The first is direct demand via the DSP, where we leverage our own AI and machine learning to target advertising to SingleTap devices. The second is enabling other third-party demand partners from companies who can buy advertising on our SingleTap-enabled supply. Third is licensing mobile web traffic from brands such as Epic Games' Fortnite title which end use a single to convert web visitors to native applications. The fourth is distributing alternative versions of the applications such as what we do with our hub and Amazon version and so on for our direct distribution of the device. And finally, it's enabling large distributors of applications such as large social media players to leverage the conversion rate benefits of SingleTap across your network. We continue to make progress on all fronts, including with multiple social media companies. In particular, I'm encouraged by the number of publishers who wanted to use SingleTap to distribute alternative builds other applications, which fits nicely with our strategy of alternative app distribution hub that I'll talk later in my remarks. And as the market expands with alternative builds SingleTap will be a primary differentiator from others for distributing those new versions of applications. Turning to future, I want to spend a few moments highlighting our longer-term growth drivers. We believe we're uniquely positioned with our on-device technology including our first-party data, our AI machine learning tools, SingleTap and our extensive publisher relation and operator and OEM relationships. We have launched our first alternative app distribution products which we brand as DT Hub with five operators here in the U.S., leveraging our Aptoide investment that are generating revenue today. We have increased our equity investment in Aptoide to almost 20%. The carrier feedback has been encouraging and we expect to be across many tens of millions of devices by the end of this calendar year. It's still early days and still not yet material to our overall results, but we are seeing incremental and higher revenue per device from devices engaging with our Hub product, which is a combination of in-app purchase revenues and incremental cost per install or CPI revenues helping publishers acquire new users. So the focus for us is driving more devices, more engagement and more downloads. We've not yet started leveraging our in-app advertising assets into this alternative app distribution but do expect that to add an additional revenue stream to this opportunity, and all three of these monetization capabilities being drivers of incremental RPD into the future. Monetizing via cost-per-install and in-app advertising are all very natural extensions of our existing business models. We also believe that global regulatory environment will provide additional thrust to this vision, especially in the EU as the Digital Markets Act becomes effective next March. Many of you have seen articles in the press talking about a concept of direct distribution of applications that involve mega-cap tech players. This is highly strategic and I want to spend a few moments describing it. Direct distribution is where any app publishers such as Spotify, Netflix, Epic Games and so on, is running advertising for a user to install its application. Rather than take the user to the Apple or Google store after clicking on the ad it would direct download the application to the device with its own unique version of an application outside of traditional app stores. And to achieve this, there are some market pain points that need to be solved such as making it easy for app publishers to port their apps to a new version, managing the payments in advertising inside the application, installing the apps without friction as there may not be a store involved and also managing the creation of the applications. And these are all things that Digital Turbine is uniquely positioned to deliver on whether directly via our own hub product or indirectly through white labeling our capabilities to large players who want to leverage their large audiences. And to that end, in addition to Aptoide we're expanding our partnership with Flexion who is the market leader in porting applications into alternative version. Flexion works not just with us but with all the other major alternative app stores such as the Samsung Galaxy store, Amazon app store, Xiaomi Get Apps, Huawei's app gallery, Aptoide, One Store in Korea and many others. In addition to paying down our debt, we're allocating our capital to pursue these new investments with a new dedicated team focused on unlocking this future growth opportunity. To recap, we have an enormous addressable market, large customers that want our solutions and operating leverage with our business models. Our focus is bringing these elements together with all the initiatives underway mentioned earlier in my remarks from alternative app stores, ad tech enhancements, platform modernizations, strategic media relationships and leveraging our global device footprint. This is our formula for future growth and scale. And with that, this concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Barrett to take you through the numbers.\nBarrett Garrison: Thanks, Bill and good afternoon everyone. Overall results in the quarter were in line with our expectations for top line and profitability, delivering sequential improvements in EBITDA and cash flow measures. Revenue of $143.3 million in the quarter was lower by 2% sequentially and down 18% year-on-year. Within ODS revenues were slightly up sequentially from the June quarter and down 9% to the prior year September quarter. And as Bill referenced, while we saw softer device volumes in Q2 this impact was offset by improved U.S. revenue per device which exceeded $6 per device and increased materially year-on-year. Our content business delivered sequential growth in the quarter, and while this part of our business has experienced headwinds from prepaid the content media from a year-on-year comparison we expect this grow over comp to run off within the December quarter. On our AGP business Q2 revenues declined 32% over prior year. While we're encouraged by the improvement in the core business, the overall decline in AGP year-on-year continues to be driven largely by the short-term impact of the consolidation and exiting of certain legacy business lines that we have discussed previously and we would expect these revenue lines will be fully consolidated by the end of the fiscal 2024. I'd reiterate Bill's earlier comments that despite the near-term headwinds we are encouraged by the platform consolidations we're making to bring the businesses together and expect these actions to have a positive return on our future growth. Our consolidated gross margin was 47% in Q2, which was constant sequentially and was down from 52% in Q2 from the prior year, driven largely by product mix shifts year-on-year, where we experienced an increase in the mix of certain lower-margin products. As a reminder, while gross margin rates can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we generally anticipate long-term margin expansion as we continue to execute on growth strategies. We remain disciplined with expenses and cash operating expenses were $39.4 million in Q2, a reduction of 7% from prior year and represented 27% of revenues in the quarter. I'll highlight that we incurred lower-than-normal performance compensation expenses in the quarter, which we would not anticipate recurring in the second half of the fiscal year. While our expenses have remained relatively constant, we are making important investments that Bill referenced to ensure we capitalize on the full potential of our growth strategy. These internal initiatives are focused on integrating the technology platforms and back office systems across our assets, developing new ad tech capabilities, and also on strategic growth initiatives, Bill discussed, namely DT hub, alternative app distribution and SingleTap. While the current and near-term periods will incur increased transformation costs due to the completion of these platform consolidations and new growth initiatives, we expect both the efficiencies and growth to begin to be reflected in our results as we move into calendar year 2024. And as I've discussed previously during this investment phase we will continue to remain highly focused on operating efficiency. Turning to profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA of $27.7 million in the quarter increased $0.7 million sequentially and was down from $48.2 million in the prior year. Our EBITDA margin of 19% grew sequentially from 18% in the June quarter and given the inherent operating leverage in our business model, we expect that active focus on expense measures and integration efforts we are taking will strengthen the platform as we return to growth and enable a greater portion of those dollars to fall to the bottom line. In the quarter we achieved non-GAAP adjusted net income of $13.9 million or $0.13 per share as compared to 35 million or $0.34 per share in the second quarter of last year. As compared to prior year, we recorded a $2 million non-cash FX loss in the quarter and also incur -- incurred greater interest expense driven by rising rates on our outstanding debt. Our GAAP net loss of $1.61 per share in the second quarter reflects a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.46 per share or $147.2 million in our AGP business unit. This charge was driven by the recent market-based factors such as the sustained decline in our market cap and increases in interest rates, as well as updates to our forecasted AGP cash flows consistent with our guidance disclosed today. There was no change to the goodwill for the ODS reporting unit and we remain excited about the AGP segment given the ad tech enhancements we've made and that are underway to enable future growth. $23.9 million in free cash flows generated for the quarter enabled us to exit Q2 with $58.1 million in cash after paying down an additional $22 million in debt using free cash flows from operations to further deleverage our deposition. Our debt balance ended the quarter at $386 million drawn on our revolving credit facility and our business --- as our business continues to strengthen, we would expect to continue to pay down our revolver. We continue to be confident in our balance sheet and capital position given our profit model cash flow generation and access to low-cost credit facility. Now let me turn to our outlook, we currently expect revenue for fiscal Q3 to be between $144 million and $150 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $27 million and $31 million and non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $0.16 and $0.19 based on approximately $104 million diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 25%. With that, let me hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darren Aftahi with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nDarren Aftahi: Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Few if I may, if my memory serves me correct last December quarter you guys guided and I think some of your channel partners maybe had some handset expectations that kind of fell off the cliff second half of the quarter. I'm just wondering if there's any conservatism baked into this December quarter similar to that. Second question, Bill, the comments you made about some of the legacy long tail publishers on the DT Shane's not migrating, is there a way you can kind of quantify to the how big and how long that impact may take? And then maybe one for Barrett, your free cash flow was pretty nice in the quarter. Congrats on that. I look back on the last quarter and there's kind of some variability sequentially, and I'm just trying to understand what maybe is a steady state of free cash flow generation vis-à-vis EBITDA cash flow. Thanks.\nBill Stone: Yes, hi, thanks, Darren. I'll take the device sales and the DT exchange and as you said Barrett can take the free cash flow one. Yes, I think on the device sales one of the things we saw here in the U.S. is a lot of carriers back during COVID had moved from two to three-year leases on the devices, both across Android and iOS. That will burn off next year. And so I think that'll be a good thing in terms of change in some of the trajectory around U.S. device demand. But in terms of the focus on the holidays right now we want to make sure that yes we're pretty conservative in what we're expecting on devices. And just in the September quarter we saw amongst our large carrier partners down millions of devices between the large carriers from September quarter, last year's September quarter this year. So I don't know if we would expect anything to dramatically change in the current quarter around that and you can do the math, multiplying it by north of six box in terms of what that impact is to us. So that's something we look forward to getting back on track with the operators next year. And then on the DT exchange side, yes, we're consolidating and really focused on where the puck is going versus where it's been. So, I mentioned a lot of things in my remarks around new features on the exchange like SDK bidding and what we see from large brands that are buying advertising through the Trade Desk or Google's TUV360 or Amazon whatever they want to buy through STK bidding. So again our exchange going into where things are going in the future to capture those dollars is going to be really key and critical. So that's where we're focused, but as part of that there's probably many thousands of long tail publishers from the legacy companies that are doing very small dollars where it's just not worth the effort to migrate them over. But in aggregate, we still have to comp over those and that's millions of dollars of revenue a quarter, it's not tens of millions and is something that will burn off and our expectation is we'll go through to where the growth is going with a lot of these brands and larger omnichannel DSPs. And now, I'll turn it over to Barrett, on the cash flow.\nBarrett Garrison: Yes. Darren, I think your question on the cash flow was kind of timing and seasonality and kind of the flow through. So we had a little over $27 million in cash from operations in this quarter. As we touched on last quarter, you're right, we mentioned some timing elements on working capital that would push into this quarter, which we saw. I think that on a quarterly basis over the year, we'd expect the flow-through of EBITDA to our cash from operations to be around 50% and to give or take a quarter or so. Those will - there are some timing elements, especially when we see rises in revenue. But otherwise we see about 50% of our EBITDA turn it into free cash for us.\nDarren Aftahi: Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nBarrett Garrison: Thanks. Darren.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Siddiqui with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: [technical difficulty] for Omar. Thanks so much for the question - for taking my question. So I know you guys are were working on - working with some of the supply partners in the U.S. to fill demand from the Chinese e-commerce players like TMall like you guys have touched on that a little bit in the prepared remarks. I'm just wondering if there has been any progress there. And just in terms of timeline like when should we expect sort of the hurdles to clear out? Thanks.\nBill Stone: Yes. So, our expectation is that we're going to see some positive progress in the current quarter, and we do not bake that into our outlook, just because it's not here yet. If it happens, then that's great. But your expectation is we are seeing a positive movement in the current quarter. But I think as we go into next year, we're going to see some improvements there. We continue to see a lot of popular Chinese apps that want to run on U.S. supply. You were given some of the historical geopolitical things we've seen throughout the balance of this year that's really limited the dollars that we've been able to run on that. It does vary by partner. So partner X has maybe a little more conservative view then partner Y on these things and then even within the apps themselves. So there's really two impacts there. One is the actual dollars from the Chinese, the popular Chinese applications. But the other thing is the rising tide lifts all boats, meaning that the rates that others now have to pay when there's higher rates coming in from them. So there's kind of a double whammy there. So we're obviously working hard to derisk that with our operator partners because our expectation is that's something that could be a material driver for us on our OES business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Stoss: Hi, guys. Bill, over the last couple of quarters, you've talked about a large social media company expected to go live with SingleTap by the end of this year. Can you update us where they stand? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nBill Stone: Yes, sure, Tony. Yes. Unfortunately, a large social media company doesn't want me making any statements on their behalf so unfortunately I can't make any statements here today around that. I'd like to - so I kind of say stay tuned, nothing has changed from our prior comments or remarks. We continue to have good relationships there, but unfortunately nothing I can say specifically on the topic today.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And then just I'm going to pick one of your SingleTap customers, Amazon. I think they've been live for maybe just short of a year. Talk to us about what the experience has been, do you expect them to renew? What do you expect pricing? Because it seems like you're not generating a lot of revenue yet from SingleTap, more or less giving it away or attractive prices to get them hooked. I'd love to hear kind of the experience of your customers who have been using it for, say, a year or less.\nBill Stone: Yes, sure. So Amazon specifically today what we do with Amazon is we have a licensing deal with Amazon where they pay us a fixed fee, let's call it you seven figures a year in revenue to distribute the alternative versions of the Amazon apps, so, and then the store itself. So think about things like Prime and Audible and so on. And that relationship has been going great, with Amazon. Our next step with them is to expand it to third-party applications. So think Candy Crush, Uber, Starbucks, that kind of thing and that would be kind of next leg of the relationship there that would have a different monetization with them and so we're working through some of those integration details right now. But I characterize relationship is in a good spot. I think we all want to see things move faster than what we're seeing right now. But in terms of delivering the conversion rate benefits that they expect we're absolutely seeing that in the marketplace.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And then just trying to get a little bit more info on the Latin American carrier that you talked about that you expect to go live with your RPD. I mean really attractive for carriers. Where do you stand with kind of interest levels from other international carriers?\nBill Stone: Yes. So the pipeline is really robust and I expect to have some good things to talk about here over the upcoming future because the pipeline is in really good shape right now. We're in the process of launching with this quarter with some new Latin American operators, which is encouraging to continue to expand our presence down there and then I touched on Xiaomi as well in my comments. And really the point here is rather than just being only relying upon a few operators here in the U.S., we've got to go ahead and cast a wider net and get a wider footprint so we're not relying upon just upgrade cycles here in the U.S. and that's exactly what we're doing.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. Thanks, Bill. Appreciate it.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nTim Horan: Hi guys, thanks. The last few years, I think your fiscal fourth quarter revenues have been down 10% or so and EBITDA a little bit, any reason it should be different this year?\nBarrett Garrison: Yes. I don't know that it would be much of a different seasonal factor. Tim, one thing we are considering is last December quarter was quite unique and didn't have quite the holiday seasonal lift that many expected in the ad markets. So, we've taken what we think is a pretty prudent approach to how we're thinking about our December quarter. But I don't think outside of historical trends a seasonal decline, a normal seasonal decline wouldn't be odd for Q4 this year.\nTim Horan: Got it. And can you give us a sense of the profitability of the two main lines of business at this point and maybe relative kind of growth rates for '25? Yes.\nBarrett Garrison: Tim was your question around -\nTim Horan: Well, can you give us a sense of, is there much difference in profitability for the two different business units on an EBITDA basis and then and how about growth into 2025, maybe in total for the two units? Yes.\nBarrett Garrison: Yes, so let me start with the first one on kind of profitability. I'd say there is a difference on profitability, especially when you think about the margin and we have some details in the Q that you will be able to review which breaks out the profitability. It doesn't have all the expenses, but just give you a sense of that. But as a reminder, much of our exchange business on our AGP business is reported on a net basis. So you will see the margins are slightly higher. Bottom on an absolute dollar basis they are similar profitability. Of course, there are different products within each of those business units that have different economic and profitability profiles. But typically, I'd say they are similar on an absolute dollar basis, but on a margin basis, our AGP business would be higher. And then secondly, given the growth profile, we're not guiding to next year, but you would hear optimism around many of the things, the investments we put in place as well as some of the comps that we're growing over that would enable and allow us to grow next year.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nBarrett Garrison: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stone for any closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Thanks everyone for joining the call tonight. We'll look forward to reporting on our progress against all the points made on tonight's call. We'll talk to you again in our fiscal 2024 third quarter call in a few months. Thanks, and have a great night.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending the presentation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Digital Turbine Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Bartholomew, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Bartholomew: Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Turbine fiscal year 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today to discuss our results are CEO, Bill Stone, and CFO, Barrett Garrison. Before we get started, I’d like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current assumptions, expectations, and beliefs, including projected operating metrics, future products and services, anticipated market demand, and other forward-looking topics. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance, and some will inevitably prove to be incorrect. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, please refer to the documents we exchange -- we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures of our performance. Non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for GAAP measures. Please refer to today’s press release for important information about the limitations of using non-GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial results to the most comparable GAAP measures. Now I’ll turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Bill Stone.\nBill Stone: Thanks, Brian, and thank you all for joining our call tonight. For the June quarter, I was pleased that we beat the top end of our guidance range, both on the top and bottom lines, but we still have a lot of work to do to reach both our internal expectations and the potential of our broader total addressable market or TAM. I was pleased that we had a very clean quarter as operationally we sequentially improved our business performance across key financial metrics. But the strategy is not simply to harvest our profitable products for short-term financial performance, but rather use our profitability to make capital investments against the future with new technology platforming, new ad tech capabilities, our Hub, alternative app distribution, and SingleTap. We believe these investments will prove to be well served against our future growth. I’ll provide updates on those future growth drivers after providing some operational updates and commentary on the current business. For the June quarter, we had $146.4 million of revenue $27 million of EBITDA, and $0.18 of non-GAAP earnings per share and gross profit margins were 47.1%. All of these financial metrics represented sequential improvements from our March quarterly results. From a segment perspective, despite continued soft device sales, our on device business or ODS also grew sequentially to $98.3 million. Operationally, I was pleased with our improvement of revenue per device or RPD in the U.S., which continues to grow and set an all-time high in the June quarter. Over the past five years, our RPDs have accreted from just over $2 in fiscal year 2020 to $3 in fiscal 2021, to $4 in fiscal 2022 to $5 in fiscal ‘23 and today is now over $6. We continue to see strong demand from our platform both from advertisers and new products contributing more revenue to each device. Expanding global demand to our U.S. device supply has also been a big driver of those improved revenue per device results as two years ago U.S. demand was approximately 50% of our U.S. supply, and today it is less than 25%. In particular, we’ve seen some positive movement on the willingness of our U.S. supply partners to soften their positions on some popular Chinese applications, which increases the overall demand for our platform. While we expect the current quarter to experience continued softness in the U.S. devices, we expect a strong global pipeline of expanding telcos and OEM relationships to help offset any macro weakness in device sales in the future. We also made progress on our SingleTap enablement. As a reminder we have five ways monetize SingleTap. The first is direct demand via our demand side platform where we leverage our own AI and machine learning to target advertising to SingleTap enabled devices. The second is enabling other third-party demand partners from companies who can buy advertising on our SingleTap enabled supply. The third is licensing mobile web traffic from brands such as Epic Games Fortnite title, which then uses SingleTap to convert its web visitors into native Fortnite users. The fourth is distributing alternative versions of applications, whether that’s our own DT Hub version and Amazon version and so on for direct distribution device. And the fifth is enabling large distributors of application installs, such as large social media players to leverage the conversion rate benefits of SingleTap across their entire network. And given there’s so many use cases of how we utilize SingleTap going forward, we’re going to focus on talking about SingleTap in the aggregate versus confusing investors with each individual use case, which may be seen as overwhelming with various operational metrics. However, given the investor focus on this product and interest in social media players in particular, I did want to provide some operational updates on our progress. It’s early days, but we have now generated our first revenues with TikTok, who is running SingleTap campaigns for their advertisers, wanted to use their own version of an application to their users. We are also launching this quarter with LinkedIn, who’s converting their mobile web users to native app users. And finally, we expect to begin a revenue generating pilot with another large social media company across their entire user base here in the U.S. later this calendar year. Later in my remarks, I want to connect these operational updates to where we see SingleTap [Indiscernible] with the alternative app distribution markets of the future. Our app growth platform segment or HEP business, I was pleased to see our business show sequential growth in the June quarter, which was up nearly 10% from the March quarter. We are seeing sequential improved ECPM rates on both our brand demand and DSP from advertisers, and in particular, it was encouraging to see our brand business show double-digit sequential growth as we expand our relationships with large advertisers such as Starbucks and Chase Bank. The macro market has stabilized and our execution is improving. In addition, our exchange business had solid double-digit sequential growth in the quarter and the exchange business continues to be well diversified globally with approximately 40% of our publishers in North and South America, 35% in Europe, Middle East, Africa, and 25% in Asia Pacific. We’ve made numerous enhancements to our ad tech capabilities such as improved AI and machine learning optimizations, ad rendering, new ad formats, and new bedding methodologies. We spent the last year integrating the companies and are now finally building upon the integration with new products and services. The combination of the new demand solutions and the expansion of supply types are allowing us to focus on controlling what we can control to drive improved performance. Combined with a more stable macro environment for ad spend, we expect these new ad tech capabilities to be a growth driver for our business as we enter the second-half of this fiscal year. Turning to the future, I want to spend a few moments highlighting our longer term growth drivers. I mentioned SingleTap earlier in my remarks as a strategic growth opportunity, but as we’ve mentioned on prior calls, we are building alternative app distribution for app publishers. We believe we’re uniquely positioned with our on device technology, our expansion of publisher relationships, and our operator in OEM relationships. We’ve launched our first alternative app distribution products, which we brand as DT Hub with four operators here in the United States, leveraging our Aptoide investment and are generating revenue today. The carrier feedback has been impressive and supportive and it’s very early days and not yet material to our overall results, but we are seeing incremental higher RPDs from devices engaging with our Hub product, which is a combination of incremental in app purchase revenues and incremental cost per install revenues from helping publishers acquire more users. So the focus for us is driving more devices, more engagement, and more downloads. We have not started leveraging our in app advertising assets into this alternative app distribution, but we do expect to add that as an additional revenue stream to this opportunity. And then all three of these monetization capabilities being drivers of RPD accretion into the future. We also believe the global regulatory environment will provide additional thrust to this vision. Many of you may have seen articles in the press talking about a concept of direct distribution of applications involving mega cap tech players. This is highly strategic, and I want to spend a few moments describing it. Direct distribution is where any app publisher, such as a Spotify, Netflix, or Epic Games can run advertising for a user to install its application. But rather than take the user to the Apple or Google store after clicking on the advertisement, it would direct download the application to the device with its own unique version of an application outside of the traditional app stores. And to achieve this, there are some market pain points that need to be solved, such as at making it easy for the app publishers to port their app to a new version, managing the payments and advertising inside the application, installing the apps without friction as there may not be a store involved at all; and managing the curation of the applications. And these are all things that Digital Turbine is uniquely positioned to deliver on, whether directly via our own Hub product, or indirectly through white labeling our capabilities to large players wanting to leverage their large audiences. And to accomplish all of these new growth areas, allocating resources will be key. In addition to paying down our debt, we are allocating capital to these new investments with a new dedicated team focused on unlocking this future growth opportunity. And despite these investments, our cash operating expenses are flat from the June quarter last year as we were focused on running lean and efficient with our legacy products, while simultaneously investing in new platforms and products for future growth and scale. And Barrett will provide additional details in his remarks. And before I turn it over to Barrett, I want investors to take away from a quarter that we had a very clean quarter and operationally, we sequentially improved our business performance across the key financial metrics, and we’re making progress against our longer term vision, but still have much work to do. Our strategy is to use that profitability to make investments against the future with new technology platforms, new ad tech capabilities, our Hub and alternative app distribution, and SingleTap. And with that, this concludes my prepared remarks. And I’ll turn it over to Barrett to take you through the numbers.\nBarrett Garrison: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we were pleased to see results in the quarter ahead of our expectations for both top line and profitability measures. Revenue of $146.4 million in the quarter, was up 4% sequentially and down 22% year-on-year with revenues improving sequentially across both segments of our business on device solutions or ODS and our app growth platform or AGP from the March quarter. Within ODS, revenues were slightly up sequentially from the March quarter and down 17% to the prior year. However, as Bill referenced, while we saw softer device volumes in Q1, this impact was offset by improved U.S. revenue per device, which exceeded $6 per device and increased both sequentially quarter. As we’ve discussed in the past, while our content business has stabilized in the quarter, our ODS segment continues to experience headwinds from our prepaid content media business from a year-over-year comparison, and we expect this grow over comp to run off by Q3 within the December quarter. On our AGP business, Q1 revenues increased 9% sequentially and declined 32% over prior year. While we’re encouraged by the improvement in the core business, the overall decline in AGP year-on-year continues to be driven largely by the short-term impact of the consolidation and exiting of certain legacy ad colony business lines that we have discussed previously. And we would expect these comps to fully run off by the back half of this fiscal year. I reiterate Bill’s earlier comment that despite the near-term headwinds, we’re encouraged by the integration benefits we are seeing from the investments we’re making to bring these businesses together and expect these moves to have a positive return on our future growth. Our consolidated gross margin was 47% in Q1, which increased from Q4 sequentially and was down from 50% in Q1 from the prior year. Improvements in margins sequentially were largely driven by the combination of quarterly product mix shifts, where we experienced an increase in the mix of certain higher margin products or those where revenues are recognized on a net basis. As a reminder, while gross margin rates can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we generally anticipate long-term margin expansion as we continue to execute on growth opportunities. We remain disciplined with expenses and cash operating expenses were $42 million in the quarter, increasing 1% from prior year and represented 29% of revenues in the quarter. I’d highlight, while our expenses have remained relatively constant, we are making important investments that Bill referenced to ensure we capitalize on the full potential of our growth strategy. These internal initiatives are focused on integrating the technology platforms and financial and back office systems across our assets. Also, developing new ad tech capabilities and strategic growth initiatives Bill discussed, namely within DT Hub, alternative app distribution, and SingleTap. While the current and near-term periods will incur increased, due to the completion of these integrations and new growth initiatives, we expect both the efficiencies and the growth to begin to be reflected on our results as we move into calendar year 2024. During this investment phase, we will continue to remain highly focused on operating efficiency. Turning to our profitability, our adjusted EBITDA of $27 million in the quarter increased $3.8 million sequentially and was down from $52 million in the prior year. Our EBITDA margin of 18% grew sequentially from 16% in the March quarter. And given the inherent operating leverage in our business model, we expect the active focus on expense measures and integration efforts we are taking will strengthen the platform as we return to growth and enable a greater portion of those dollars to fall to the bottom line. In the quarter, we achieved non-GAAP adjusted net income of $18.2 million or $0.18 per share, as compared to the $38.7 million or $0.38 per share in the first quarter of last year. As compared to prior year, we incurred greater interest expense driven by the rising rate environment on our outstanding debt. Our GAAP net loss was $8.4 or $0.08 per share based on a 103.5 diluted shares outstanding and compared to a prior year netting of $15 million or $0.15 per share, on a 102.7 million diluted shares outstanding. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $58.6 million after paying down an additional $5 million in debt using cash flows from operation to further deleverage our debt position. Cash flow and working capital were negatively impacted by the timing of revenues, which will wait toward the end of the quarter, and we expect to return to generating positive free cash flow in Q3. Our debt balance ended the quarter at $408 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. And as our business continues to strengthen, we would expect to continue to pay down our revolver in larger quarterly increments. We continue to be confident in our balance sheet and our capital position given our profit model, cash flow generation, and access to low cost credit facility. Now let me turn to our outlook. We currently expect revenue for fiscal Q2 to be between $141 million and $149 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $25 million $27 million. And non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $0.13 and $0.15 based on approximately a 104 million diluted shares outstanding, and an effective tax rate of 25%. With that, let me hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We’ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nArthur Chu: Hey, guys. This is Arthur on for Omar. Thanks for taking the question. So my question is on Google’s header bidding into fair bit, you know, I understand this has been testing, but I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about, you know, some of the early signals we’re seeing from the initial integrations and, you know, what sort of learnings are you taking away from the initial testing? And probably just, you know, on the same note, like, if we should be expecting any sort of revenue contribution impact for the [Indiscernible] in the next fiscal year? Thank you.\nBill Stone: Yes, sure. I’ll take that one. The short answer is yes. you know, we’re seeing positive impacts there and the strategy here is obviously to increase our share of voice and demand, into the mediation platform, which then benefits publishers. And so, having the ability to bring Google is obviously vast demand is a positive for us, still very early days. I wouldn’t characterize it as moving to [Indiscernible] or so. We’re still, kind of, optimizing what we’re doing around that. But, it’s absolutely something as we think as we go into next year, bringing more demand, bringing the credibility of Google to our publishers is something we think will be a benefit for us.\nArthur Chu: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Today’s next question comes from Dan Day with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed.\nDan Day: Yes. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me? There was a little choppy at that.\nBill Stone: Yes, I think it’s the operator’s line.\nDan Day: Okay, great. So, thanks for taking the questions. Bill, in the past, when you talked about SingleTap on these calls, You’ve been pretty cautious around, kind of, the path to material revenue generation. You’ve been pretty clear. You know, you’re developing it, investors should be patient. I didn’t hear you say that this time. Can we take that as a sign that you guys maybe have any more visibility than you have in past quarters into it becoming a material revenue contributor, or am I just reading too much into that?\nBill Stone: Yes, we continue to be excited SingleTap. I mean, there’s no question about that, it’s not -- it was not material to our results in the June quarter, but there’s a lot catalysts that we’re seeing into the future, right now. And so, we’re starting to see some excitement on the catalyst and the opportunity for scale to really improve on that. I will say it will, it’s going to take time, but the encouraging signs are starting to really show for us, with the product. And, you know, the thing that really I want to remind investors about is we have this embedded base of many, many hundreds of millions of devices, and that’s extremely difficult for anyone to replicate. And so, you know, having that high, amount of devices already out in the market at global scale and our focus to continue to grow that, you know, something I think that, advertisers, publishers, demand side platforms and all the people that are going to integrate in this new app world is something I think they’re going to -- want to take advantage of. I think important point I want to also make on this is the integration with the alternative app stores, you know, there’s going to be this increasing -- our view is that, I mean, it’s increasing pressure on the duopoly of app stores today. And that the ability to have a publisher get lower rates to pay, is going to -- they want something -- they’re going to acquire new users. And SingleTap is an enabler to help make that happen to distribute a non-Google or non-Apple built, out to customer. So that’s going to be something that, you know, we’re excited about and leveraging our existing hub capabilities to go do.\nDan Day: Great, thanks. And then just for the fiscal second quarter revenue outlook, so the midpoint is right around where, fiscal first quarter revenue came in. Just any material difference between the on device versus the app growth platform segments, as far as the outlet goes? Or do you think pretty flat for both quarter-over-quarter?\nBarrett Garrison: Yes. Dan, I think we think about, you know, in the Q1, we’ve seen we touched on the improvements we’re seeing in AGP business, you know, near 10% sequential improvement. You know, we think there’s a lot of opportunity there. We don’t give guidance by segment, but, you know, we’re seeing nice trends there. We touched on some of the device softness, that, you know, is sometimes hard to predict. I think we might see that for the, you know, the near-term that’s kind of embedded in our guidance. But, you know, I think the AGP business is, you know, is growing nicely on a sequential basis. And I think that might be a continued trend we’d expect to see.\nDan Day: Perfect. Thank you guys. Appreciate taking the questions.\nBarrett Garrison: Thank you.\nOperator: Today’s next question is from [Technical Difficulty] Roth. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is [Dylan] [ph] on for Darren. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to sort of talk about, sort of, RPD in the U.S., you mentioned it’s an all-time high at $6. I think you sort of said 25% full supply. So I guess, I mean, what are sort of your strategies in going after growing that RPD on the international side, both with sort of higher monetization on the existing devices and sort of just capturing more devices in the different markets with some of the partners you’ve mentioned in the past?\nBill Stone: Yes, sure. What we’re seeing right now and it was encouraging, is the diversification of our demand on our U.S. supply. And I wanted to highlight that out, particularly because, you know, now we’re to a point where, you know, we’re well north of you know, 50% of the demand coming in to U.S. supply from places outside the United States and a lot of international advertisers, whether they are from Europe or APAC want to be on those devices. And so, being able to bring those onto devices, and then we can do strategic demand deals and whether that’s carving out things like, you know, whether particular game type or, you know, social media or whatever happens to be, allows that international competition as well to come in. And so that allows us to achieve higher rates. So that’s something that, has been really encouraging for us. Now the key is for us, how do we expand that to other markets whether that’s in Europe or Latin America or what have you. So major focus area for us to replicate that success that we’re seeing in the U.S. outside. That’s on the advertiser side. And then the other part would be on the product side. So, you know, historically, as you’re well aware, we started with dynamic installs as a primary product. But as we’ve added so many other products to our portfolio, the product growth is also enhancing RPD. So the combination of this more demand on the platform combined with the more products on the platform is really helping drive those, accretion and results.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. And sort of as a follow-up with some of the investments you mentioned, with ad tech, and with other app stores, like, how should we think about the timeline of that trade off of the incremental investment dollars that aren’t really bringing in revenue, in terms of, like, the OpEx, sort of, when do you start to see those contribute?\nBill Stone: Yes, let me start on the revenue side and then we’ll turn it over to Barrett on the OpEx side. You know, right now in terms of how we’re thinking about it, in terms of the back end of this year, you know, Barrett mentioned his remarks on AGP, you know, show a nice sequential growth. And our view right now is in the short-term as we look at future quarters, in the near-term that, you know, AGP and these enhancements and things I mentioned in my prepared remarks will be drivers. And as we get into next year, you know, I think you’re going to see more things like with the Hub and SingleTap and some of these other things ramping, is how we think about it from a revenue/business perspective. And I’ll turn it over to Barrett to talk about the OpEx and the investment side.\nBarrett Garrison: Yes, Dylan, I think, you know, for your model, we touched on it in my remarks, you know, we have -- we’re incurring those expenses some of those excess costs for, you know, a lot of the back office systems that we’re integrating, bringing the companies together. Those are our financial systems. Those are, you know, things like our HR systems, as well as the investments in the teams that Bill touched on. Those investments are in place today. I think we’re going to carry those expenses, at kind of similar levels, out through the end of the calendar year and then we’ll start to see, you know, those costs, those investments drop off and you’ll start to see efficiencies in both our cost structure, as well as the incremental growth in revenues, begin to pick up as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nBarrett Garrison: Thanks, Dylan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Anthony Stoss from Craig Hallum. Please proceed.\nAnthony Stoss: Hey, Bill. I wanted to ask about this verge article where they were interviewing a meta employee and they are discussing would certainly sound like SingleTap functionality. If not, digital turbine, who else could it be?\nBill Stone: Yes. It’s hard for me, Tony, to comment on, like, things that came from somebody on future speculation. So I’m going to kind of stay away from that. But what I will say, is that you’re seeing mega cap tech players not just meta, but others, now talking about alternative app distribution. And you’re seeing, and specifically in Europe, now that the digital markets act is coming into reality and you’re seeing, for example, side loading applications on things like iOS 17, it was really opening up a lot of interest from mega cap players, you know, and I’d highlight Amazon, I’d highlight, with the Microsoft Activision Blizzard deal getting done, as an example, Meta was in the article you’re referencing. So there’s a lot of interest, you know, starting to see right now. But I think the key is that, okay, it’s one thing to have the interest and have the -- want to be able to do this. The question then becomes how? And so when you think about, you know, how the apps actually get ported from different versions, how you manage the internal, kind of, plumbing of the apps, how you make it a friction free experience, if it’s not store. It should be in effect direct distributed down to you. How do you curate that on the device with your telco and OEM partners? Those are all things that we’ve got unique advantages to go to. And so when I mentioned in my comments doing it directly through DT Hub or doing it white labeling with other large players, I think we’re in a pretty unique spot, you know, here to really capture on this wave of alternative app distribution. And so it’s something from our perspective, I think about CTV a few years ago and how CTV is today. I almost say about alternative app distributions, kind of, at these early innings today and, you know, something, you know, as the regulations and some of these other large players and just customers and publishers, you know, really wanting alternative choice. I think it’s going to be some really nice opportunities that, you know, we’re really uniquely positioned to just given the embedded base of devices with our technology already on them.\nAnthony Stoss: Okay. And then a couple of follow-ups on -- in past quarters, Bill, you talked about, I think it was in your prepared remarks, quite often international carrier launches. Clearly, the on device segments weak in the U.S, not a shock to anybody. Is there anything or new carriers that you’re planning on launching that will help offset that? I mean, I think in the past, you used to highlight the percent of the international markets covered and then you guys haven’t really done that lately. I’m just -- if you could update us, that’d be helpful.\nBill Stone: Yes, absolutely. I did make a comment in the prepared remarks around, you know, strong global pipeline of expanding the telcos and OEM relationships. And so I kind of dry it at that. You know, we’re not going to names here on the call, for obvious reasons. But, we think we have a lot of optimism right now in terms of, you know, the ability to continue expand, our addressable market here.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And then if I can slide in one for Barrett, you know, normally your seasonal -- your December quarter is up pretty strongly seasonally. Any thoughts on if you expect it to be more muted again this year like it was last?\nBarrett Garrison: Maybe Andrew, that’s December?\nAnthony Stoss: Yes.\nBarrett Garrison: But Tony. Yes, so you know, December was an odd quarter last year, right? We kind of, markets change quite quickly. I think, you know, as we’re seeing things now, I would like to expect that we see, you know, closer to a more normalized seasonal trend. I don’t -- not sure we’re back to -- not sure we’re back to, you know, ‘21 levels, but, yes, we would expect to see some seasonal uplift for the holiday quarter.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And one last quickie for Bill. Love to hear more on Aptoide, I hope, I know you think it is. I’m just curious kind of where you’re at with Aptoide?\nBill Stone: Yes, you know, we continue our Aptoide, technology partnership has been great. They’re techs integrated into our Hub product today. They’ve been great to work with. You know, we’re looking forward to expanding with them looking forward to expanding with others, you know, there’s a lot of players out there in the space, you know, Aptoide has been fantastic, but I think that, you know, we’re -- we want to think about it even broader than that. We think there’s an enormous community, you heard the word investment a lot, in Barrett and in my prepared remarks. So we really want to think about how we can, you know, get after the space and really have some first mover advantages.\nAnthony Stoss: Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nBarrett Garrison: Thank you, Tony.\nOperator: At this time, we [Technical Difficulty] questioner in the queue. And this does concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stone for any closing remarks.\nBill Stone: Yes. Thanks for everyone joining the call today. You know, we’ll look forward to reporting on our progress against all the points that we made on the call, and we’ll talk to you again on our fiscal ‘24 second quarter call in a few months. Thanks, and have a great night.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect."
