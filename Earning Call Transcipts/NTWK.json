The company's discussion may include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of the company's future, and our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in NetSol's press releases and SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. I would also like to point out that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures. The press release issued earlier today contains a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial results to their most comparable GAAP measures. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that this call will be recorded and made available for replay at www.netsoltech.com and via link available in today's press release. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Najeeb. Najeeb?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Like we began the fiscal year, our second quarter of fiscal 2024 was characterized by increases in total revenue, improved gross margins and profitability, which demonstrates both the strength of our business model and our ability to execute on our growth strategy. Revenue grew once again in the quarter, driven by solid performance across our business. As we continue to scale our SaaS business, our hybrid license and SaaS model has become a strong catalyst for our growth in both this quarter and throughout the fiscal 2024. We recognized substantial license fees of $3 million in this quarter as part of a new large contract in Asia with a major automotive company. We are thrilled. We have distinguished ourselves from a highly competitive pool of candidates to win this contract, which we expect to officially announce in the coming weeks. Our selection reflects both our visibility and recognition in the market as well as the superior performance and reliability of our products that is required by major companies operating on a global scale. License fees are a key part of our business, and we expect them to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. That said, license revenues can be a bit lumpy, and a major focus for us is to continue to build on an already robust pipeline of potential licensing and SaaS opportunities to deliver more consistent results over the long term. We achieved growth in our recurring subscription and support revenues in the quarter. At the heart of our SaaS business are products like the Otoz digital retail platform and our API-first marketplace, Appex Now. We are committed to the continuous innovation and improvement of these and additional SaaS offerings to meet the diverse demands of our customers, integrating a leading technology, such as deep learning AI algorithms, to ensure that we are positioned at the forefront of our industry. During the quarter, we unveiled Otoz 2.0, implementing major updates to our digital retail and mobility platform to expand on existing offerings, with a phased launch planned over the next year. The Otoz platform is a premier SaaS offering, powering services, such as MINI USA's MINI Anywhere retail platform since June 2021. Supported by Otoz, MINI Anywhere enrollment has doubled over the past 12 months and is now active across nearly two-thirds of the MINI USA dealership network in the US, enabling a 5 times increase in lead volume and vehicle sales. Also in the quarter, we expanded our relationship with one of our key automotive clients by supporting the launch of AutoNation Mobility micro lease marketplace with Otoz's back-end technology. The automotive market is witnessing a significant shift towards short-term vehicle usage options in lieu of traditional long-term leases, and the Otoz 2.0 platform is ideally suited to support this new micro lease marketplace that allows customers to navigate the entire leasing process, from vehicle selection to deal configuration to finalizing each transaction. Overall, we're very excited and pleased with our second quarter results. As I said before, our performance is a demonstration of both the strength of our business model and our ability to execute on our growth strategy. Moreover, we continue to strategically invest and allocate capital to further expand our presence across key high-growth markets like North America, and we are pleased to see steady progress across all three of geographic markets: North America, Europe and APAC. Given our recent results and trajectory, we expect to see strong double-digit organic revenue growth and improved margins in fiscal 2024 as we move into a period of more sustainability profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Roger Almond, our CFO, to go over our financials from this quarter. Roger?\nRoger Almond: Thanks, Najeeb. Our total net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $15.2 million compared with $12.4 million in the prior-year period. On a constant currency basis, total net revenues were $15.3 million. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, total net revenues were $29.5 million compared to $25.1 million in the prior-year period. On a constant currency basis, total net revenues were $29.6 million. License fees for the quarter ended fiscal 2024 were $3 million compared with $16,000 in the prior-year period. License fees on a constant currency basis were $3.1 million. In the first six months of fiscal 2024, license fees were $4.3 million compared with $266,000 in the prior-year period and the same on a constant currency basis. Recurring revenues or subscription and support revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $6.8 million compared with $6.5 million in the prior-year period and the same on a constant currency basis. Recurring revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2024 were $13.3 million compared to $12.5 million in the prior-year period and the same on a constant currency basis. Total services revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $5.4 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior-year period and the same on a constant currency basis. Total services revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2024 were $11.9 million compared to $12.3 million in the prior-year period and the same on a constant currency basis. Total cost of revenues were $8.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $9.2 million in the second quarter fiscal year 2023. On a constant currency basis, total cost of revenues was $9.4 million. Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $7.2 million or 47% of net revenues compared with $3.1 million or 25% of net revenues in the prior-year period. On a constant currency basis, gross profit was $5.9 million. Gross profit for the six months of fiscal 2024 was $13.3 million or 45% of net revenues compared to $7.4 million or 29% of net revenues in the prior-year period. On a constant currency basis, gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2023, was $10.6 million. Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $6.1 million or 40% of sales compared to $6.2 million or 50% of sales in the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses for the second quarter were $6.7 million or 44% of sales. Operating expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023 were $12 million or 41% of sales compared with $12.3 million or 49% of sales in the prior-year period. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2024 were $13.1 million or 44% of sales. Turning to our profitability metrics. GAAP net income attributable to NetSol for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $408,000 or $0.04 per diluted share compared with a net -- a GAAP net loss of $2.1 million or a loss of $0.19 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. GAAP net income attributable to NetSol for the first six months of fiscal 2024 totaled $439,000 or $0.04 per diluted share compared with a GAAP net loss of $2.7 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Included in our net income this quarter was a loss of $15,000 on foreign currency exchange transactions compared to a gain of $657,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. On a constant currency basis, we realized a loss of $23,000 on foreign currency exchange transactions. Included in our net income for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was a loss of $149,000 on foreign currency exchange transactions compared to a gain of $2 million in the prior-year period. On a constant currency basis, we realized a loss of $197,000 on foreign currency exchange transactions. Because we operate in several geographical regions, a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the US dollar. A decrease in the value of the US dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has an effect of increasing our revenues, but it also increases our expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Similarly, as the US dollar gains strength relative to foreign currency exchange rates, it tends to reduce our revenues, but it also reduces our expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Moving to our non-GAAP metrics. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $725,000 or $0.06 per diluted share compared with a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.3 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of fiscal 2024 was $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared with a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.4 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Please see the reconciliation schedules contained in our earnings release for our revised calculations of adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Turning to our balance sheet. At quarter-end, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.7 million or approximately $1.38 per diluted common share. Total NetSol stockholders' equity at December 31, 2023 was $34.5 million or $3.03 per share. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Najeeb. Najeeb?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you, Roger. This was an excellent quarter for NetSol. We're excited by our progress and are very optimistic for the journey ahead. We believe that we are well positioned on a path towards growth and sustainable profitability, and we look forward to driving value for our shareholders as we continue to execute on our growth strategy in the later half of 2024. With that, I'd like now to turn the call over to operator for questions. Operator? Is she there? Roger? [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the inconvenience. Please stand by. We will resume momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, we thank you for your patience. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of [indiscernible]. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned integrating deep learning AI algorithms into your technology. Could you elaborate a little more on those algorithms and how you're kind of leveraging that AI to enhance your product offerings?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you for that question. Naeem, would you want to jump in?\nNaeem Ghauri: Yeah. Sure, Najeeb. So, what we do is that we have access to a lot of data, and we actually build, if you like, a warehouse of metadata, and then we run our algorithms based on that data that's coming from thousands of dealers, and our installations are across the globe coming from different markets. So, what we are able to determine are behavior and trends and patterns on, for example, what type of products are sold in one market as opposed to another, credit risk, credit underwriting, residual values on cars, how they're moving. So that data is really a treasure trove in terms of -- if you like, we run about $300 billion worth of assets on our portfolios across the globe. So, you can imagine the amount of data that we get. And on that data, we can build large language models, which is -- primarily can be used for generative AI, and then that is how we actually build our algorithms based on data that can generate a two-way conversation with any consumer going directly on our platforms, as well as our dealers who are accessing systems are able to understand somebody's credit risk pretty quickly based on how that data presents itself. So really, we are at the -- literally the tip of the iceberg, if you like, in terms of exploiting and manipulating that data to just add so much more value into our tech stack. And going forward, you will be hearing a lot more about more specialized modules and more discrete modules that we can deploy just for AI based on the amount of data we have and how much information we have on behavioral patterns to credit risk and, in fact, down to even what type of cars are being sold, down to what color, which markets. So, really it's a very exciting time for us in terms of getting into the AI, if you like, generation and iteration to now building more use cases out of the data that we have. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Absolutely. Yes, understood. Thank you. That's all for me.\nNaeem Ghauri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Todd Felte with AGES Financial. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Felte: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter there. Nice to see the improvement. Just had a few quick questions here. On the deals with MINI Cooper and AutoNation, I think, if I remember correctly, we're in 50 or 60 dealerships now. Can you quantify as to how much revenue that produces on a yearly basis for you guys?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Yes. Thank you for this question, Todd. Both Roger and Naeem may help, but this is almost 60-plus dealerships that we have onboarded so far. Roger, you have specific numbers, right, for the annual revenue?\nRoger Almond: Yes. Currently, we have, as Najeeb said, 60 dealers, and it brings in about $100,000 a year with the 60 dealers, so that's...\nNajeeb Ghauri: No, $100,000 a month.\nRoger Almond: Sorry, $100,000 a month, which is $1.2 million a year currently with the 60 dealers.\nTodd Felte: Okay. That's great to hear. And on the AutoNation, I know you're growing really fast there. How much revenue is AutoNation contributing now? And what would you project for the current fiscal year?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Naeem, you want to jump in? Naeem is a champion of AutoNation and mobility products. Go ahead, Naeem, please.\nNaeem Ghauri: I can pick that up. So Todd, this is a different use case to many. For many, we are doing digital retail. For AutoNation, we're doing subscription. And what they've done is that they have launched the subscription product, we did a soft launch. But in terms of the revenue, we have generated already just over $1 million in terms of implementation and just tailoring the platform for their use case. Going forward, we believe if they hit the targets, this could be big or as big, at least, if not bigger than what we're doing with MINI, subject to them hitting targets, because the subscription is based on certain tiers. If they hit those tiers in terms of usage, then the revenue starts to grow. So, it's an exciting model because it's a win-win. If they grow, when they grow, we grow with them. And it could -- there's no upper limit or ceiling to where the revenue can grow if they do grow the product with the right marketing and planning.\nTodd Felte: Okay. That's great to hear. And I assume that since it's set up, the margins on that AutoNation business, now that everything is set up, are extremely high for you?\nNaeem Ghauri: I'm sorry, what's the question? It's all set up, yes.\nTodd Felte: Yes. So, the margins should be very high on that AutoNation as it continues to grow?\nNaeem Ghauri: Well, what happens is that there is a setup cost, which the client pays for. And our product is deployed on the cloud, and it's very, very scalable. So, it's like we could grow the Otoz's revenue by fivefold, 5x, without having a major impact on cost. So, really, it's the adoption. The faster or bigger the adoption, the better the margins, because we do have a fixed amount of cost to run the platform, and we are already in profit in terms of what we bring from MINI and AutoNation. So, we're already in the black. However, as they scale and they grow and we get additional customers, so we have a pipeline of new customers we are bidding for. And as that happens, with scale, the profit margins would grow quite rapidly.\nTodd Felte: That's great to hear. I know your license agreement can be lumpy, and I know that currency exchanges or the currency gains and losses can affect your net income. But have you all reached the point yet where you're able to project positive operating income every quarter going forward? Or are you comfortable thinking that will happen?\nNaeem Ghauri: I'll just give my take, then I'll leave it up to you.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Go ahead, Naeem.\nNaeem Ghauri: My take, Todd, is that, ultimately, the future for us is SaaS, but we are operating on a hybrid model where license is still very attractive. And although it's lumpy, good news is that from where we were three, four years ago, we're depending completely on license, now we are offsetting a large portion of our revenue within ARR, which is annual recurring revenue, as opposed to the lumpy license revenue. So, even if we don't get a big license revenue or, if you like, a win, we continue to grow our SaaS revenue at a decent pace so that, at some point, we'll have a tipping point where we will get to a position where even without any license income, we are profitable as a company.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Also, let me add one more point, Todd, to Naeem. The beauty of our model is that, like Naeem said, it's a hybrid model. We do have a pretty good demand for our flagship Ascent in all three markets. Yes, it's a much longer sales cycle, then it goes through a lot of, I think, iteration. But combination is amazing with the license revenue and then, of course, with the SaaS, which is a growing trajectory for us. So all in all, I believe we are in a good position. If you look at the competitor, I think really, you see a company which has such an amazing history for license sales in all these 25 years. Now, we're managing both sides quite well effectively, and we believe, eventually, as I said in my prepared remarks, the growth is quite positive coming quarters and hopefully will continue in the following year. So I think overall, the higher revenue, whether it's license or, of course, SaaS, it just affects all the way to the gross margin and net income. And company has done a good job to be more efficient and a bit more leaner. That will impact all our metrics in the coming quarters.\nTodd Felte: That's great. And that tipping point that Naeem spoke about where you won't even need licensing agreements to achieve an operating profit, would you expect that to happen this year or next year? Or is there any sort of...\nNajeeb Ghauri: I believe next year is more probably because we're still building the sales trajectory here. So, I think, Naeem, next year is a better way to look at it, but to your question, specifically on the margins.\nNaeem Ghauri: Look, I think in terms of when that tipping point is, I don't think we could predict that, but I think it's imminent. If you see a growth and if you see how subscription revenue has grown from single-digit millions to where we are in a relatively short time, I think we're reaching that point very soon. I don't -- I can't put a, if you like, a flag on exactly which quarter or which month, but I think we're not far off.\nTodd Felte: Okay. That's great to hear. And then my final question is, I know in the past, you've had several share buybacks going. You look at the stock now. I think we're right around $3 a share in book value, and we're doing over $5 a share in sales. Do you have any share buybacks going on now? Or do you plan to announce any in the near future?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Well, at this stage, we don't have any plan immediately in the short run, simply because, as I mentioned, we are investing in key markets, whether it's North America and some other regions, and there's a lot of activities in the new business opportunities, some new markets also, which we'll share with the market in the appropriate time. So obviously, we have done buybacks a few times in the past. And you're right, it is a very attractive price to do that, but we are very open about it, but we have not made the decision at this point.\nTodd Felte: Okay. Well, I really appreciate you all taking my questions and congratulations on a fantastic quarter.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you, Todd.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So, I'd like to pass the floor back to management for any additional closing remarks.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you for joining us today, and I do apologize for this little glitch in the beginning of the Q&A. I especially want to thank all of our investors for their continued support, our loyal customers and our most dedicated employees worldwide for their ongoing contributions. And we look forward to updating you on our next call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Once again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Patti McGlasson, General Counsel. Thank you, Patti. You may begin.\nPatti McGlasson: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Najeeb. Najeeb?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter of 2024, which was highlighted by increases in total net revenues, improved gross margin and profitability. Revenue grew in the first quarter due to solid performance across our business. Each of our three complementary revenue streams contributed meaningfully. Importantly, we recognized approximately $1.3 million in licensing revenues from Isuzu Motors, a multi-national auto manufacturer based in Japan. Our goal going forward is to find more licensing deals so that we can drive more consistent license revenue from quarter-to-quarter. In addition to the licensing fees, we also continue to see consistent revenue recognition from subscription and support or SaaS-based revenue as well as our services revenue, which is generated after a licensing deal is signed. Also on display this quarter was the impact of increased cost discipline across the organization. Cost containment remains a priority as we focus on freeing capital to allocate to our two most vibrant growth opportunities, the growth of our SaaS business and the penetration of the US market. Our expansion in the US continues to progress as we focus on staffing our new office in Austin, Texas with the best talent available. Our goal with this facility is to aggressively expand NetSol into the United States, which is a largely untapped market for us. In addition to organic growth in the US, we continue to carefully evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities in North America. We're also now live with Otoz, our SaaS based white label platform, providing long-term, on-demand mobility model and retail solutions in 60 MINI Anywhere dealership across 37 US states, demonstrating the demand of our SaaS products in this market. On the business development front, we continue to see strong activity and remain focused on building a pipeline of potential licensing deals. In summary, we are very pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. Our performance reflects the earnings potential of the NetSol business model as we scale revenue. We are working diligently to drive more predictable revenue with additional licensing deals and continued expansion of our SaaS offerings, which we believe will drive improved and more consistent profitability and cash generation. I'll now turn the call over to Roger Almond, our Chief Financial Officer, to go over our financials from this quarter. Roger?\nRoger Almond: Thanks, Najeeb. Our total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $14.2 million compared with $12.7 million in the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, net revenues were $14.3 million. License fees are approximately $1.3 million compared with $250,000 in the prior year period and the same on a constant currency basis. Recurring revenue or subscription and support revenues for the first quarter were $6.5 million compared with $6 million in the prior year period and the same on a constant currency basis. Total services revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 million compared with $6.4 million in the prior year period and $6.5 million on a constant currency basis. Total cost of revenues were $8.1 million for the first quarter compared to $8.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. On a constant currency basis, total cost of revenues was $9.6 million. Gross profit for the first quarter fiscal 2024 was $6.2 million or 43% of net revenues compared with $4.3 million or 33% of net revenues in the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, gross profit was $4.7 million. Operating expenses for the first quarter were $5.8 million or 41% of sales compared to $6.1 million or 48% of sales in the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 million or 45% of sales. Turning to our profitability metrics. Our GAAP net income attributable to NetSol for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $31,000 or $0.003 per diluted share compared with a GAAP net loss of $621,000 or a loss of $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. Included in our net income this quarter was a loss of $134,000 on foreign currency exchange transactions compared to a gain of approximately $1.3 million in the first quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, we realized a loss of $174,000 on foreign currency exchange transactions. Because we operate in several geographical regions, a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the US dollar. A decrease in the value of the US dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of increasing our revenues, but it also increases our expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Likewise, as the US dollar gains strength relative to foreign currency exchange rates, it tends to reduce our revenues, but it also reduces our expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Moving to our non-GAAP metrics. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $466,000 or $0.04 per diluted share compared with a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $28,000 or $0.002 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. Please see the reconciliation schedules contained in our earnings release for our revised calculations of adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Turning to our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $16.6 million or approximately $1.46 per diluted common share. Total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2023 was $36.7 million or $3.22 per diluted share. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Najeeb. Najeeb?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you, Roger. This was an excellent quarter for us. Our focus is on more consistently delivering solid revenue growth, maintaining cost discipline across the company and executing on our strategy to drive our SaaS business and penetrate the US market. This is how we build long-term value for the shareholders. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from [Tyler Brewer with Stone Works Capital] (ph). Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you for taking my question. So I was just wondering, could you talk a little more about the long-term strategy for the US market and whether you think you can replicate some of the success you had overseas?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Yeah. I think it's a twofold question. One is, of course, what are we doing now short term. As you heard in the presentation, we are very focused on driving business from our pretty strong pipeline across the globe. As you know, these license deals are high in value but they also take time to close if we win this deal. So that is an ongoing process. In relation to that, our SaaS business, mobility is quite, I think, impressive for us, the way we look at it. The long term I think, I feel, continue to invest in North America, which is our, we believe, not only is an untapped market, but also it's a very strong and resilient market for our business. Given all the challenges across the globe, I feel both US and China are very strong markets for us. I was personally there just recently and met with all the customers and our employees, and the environment is still very robust for our company. So I think in the long term, we feel that our growth will come from the US -- north America, Canada and US. There's a lot of activities going on given the new office. We will continue to invest in the new talent. We have been assembling some good people locally in all the key position because I think, for us, to make a solid name in the market and scale our business, we need to have a lot more new executive level positions so that we are not dependent on people traveling regularly to US from different countries. So we are now investing and building up our Austin, Texas office with the right talent both in the sales, marketing and client relations. That is really, to me, is the future, because once we have a bigger scale and capability on site, everyone knows, our customers and new prospects, that our amazing dependency on our technology campus in Lahore, Pakistan which is state-of-the-art, it supports our customers worldwide and never miss our delivery commitment. So we're pretty confident for our future outlook long term because investment in the US continues, growth in the US, China and also looking at many other markets, in Mexico, which we have a lot of customers and North America, of course, combined with China and Canada. So I feel quite good about it, about the future outlook.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you for answering my questions, and congratulations on the quarter.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Felte with AGES Financial. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Felte: Hey, congratulations on the return to profitability and thank you for taking my questions.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Sure. Thank you.\nTodd Felte: Just had a few here. First of all, do you expect the margins and profitability to continue? And are you still standing by, I believe it was at the last quarterly conference call, you had estimated revenues for this year would be somewhere $60 million to $62 million. Are you still standing by that?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Yes. So far, we are leaving that as is. And the best time would be to formally update in the second quarter, which will be [half 1] (ph), and we'll be in a better position to update or even improve the guidance. So I think now I feel pretty strong about it, yes. And the profitability is a function of essentially revenue. Our margins improved to 43% this quarter versus almost 27% previous quarter. So it's a sign that we are becoming efficient. We have cut down costs across the company. We're investing in the right people, right talent. And the revenue growth is our number one focus of course, and of course, all the key metrics. Of course, bottom line, a little bit the result of how fast we grow the revenue and the gross margins.\nTodd Felte: Okay. That's great to hear. And this is more of a general question, but as you're bidding for new customers, what percent would you say of customers that you bid on for a software project do you actually land?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Well, that's a very good question. It's -- I think some of our listeners or investors who have been following us for some time, we are in a very a unique business or even a niche business. Few companies are competing with each other. Some are very big, some are about same scale as we are, whether we're in North America or Europe or Asia. I think the pipeline is -- we don't mention the pipeline. We have a robust pipeline, pretty large size. Some are -- we believe we can achieve some successes in the near future, some will take a bit more time. If I -- say, if we have 10 deals out there and we close three of them, that will be the day for the company because it is a tough competition, because it's a very niche and few companies. Secondly, I think that we definitely are working diligently to improve our scale and capability in the US, which is again, a very robust and a strong market for us and as we get stronger in the US, our chances to win US business will only get better.\nTodd Felte: Okay. And so if you land about three out of 10 of the contracts you bid on, what do you think is the number one reason why you don't land those other seven? Or what are the areas you're improving on? Does it relate to this [indiscernible]?\nNajeeb Ghauri: I think, Todd, one thing for sure. Like I said, whether investor or long-term funds or our customers who know us well, our capabilities, our strength and our opportunities that we have, US is the most challenging market but also the most incredible market to work in. And we are working on it diligently. What happens is in every RFP we get invited, at least five top companies, sometimes five to seven, and then we become shortlisted. In most cases, we do become shortlisted. Oftentimes, the contracts are really large in size and value, then they prefer to look at the US company which have very strong US presence. And we understand that because these customers want to depend on the local. There's a company that has 70,000 employees, for example. I'm not going to share the name here. And we compete with them. Sometimes we win over them, sometimes they win over us. In China, we have beaten them many times in major contracts. So I think companies look for scale, capability. But there are companies which are midsized, mid-tier company, which is right spot for us. And in most cases, it will be good for us. It makes us better and stronger to be able to compete with the big guy. We have beaten many times -- I mean, one of them is SAP years ago in China because we were so strong in China, still are the number on company in China in this space. US is a very big market. We will do well in the coming three to five years, and positioning is the way that we get the right people, partners, joint ventures. And there's lots going on, some I'm not in the liberty of sharing because they're not public information yet. As they become material, we'll of course, disclose and share with the market. So overall, I'm very excited and bullish about the US market.\nTodd Felte: Great. That's helpful. And then my last question is, I noticed the dramatic improvement in NetSol Pakistan, which I think you own over 60% of. But I've been looking at the minority interest or your noncontrolling interest investments, and it seems like over the last 1.5 years, that's cost you about $4 million. Can you kind of discuss that and what your plans are because that's a lot of money to a company that's just now breaking into profitability?\nNajeeb Ghauri: Okay. Very good question. Look, NTI, the parent company, this company owns 67% of NetSol Pakistan. So minority interest is about 33%, of which I think mostly fund institutions, some are family ownership, which is not that much. We have more ownership than the parent company, NTI. Secondly, I think, yes, it was a good quarter. Continuously, we are investing in Lahore because what happens is, as you know, AI is a new revolution, and our AWS and some other mobility platform, these are three very important new areas that we've been investing. We’ve hired some MIT, PhD and AI specialists. They're helping us develop some solutions. We have built up some more scale in the AI side in the US and in Lahore, Pakistan because we want to provide proactively some part of the AI tools to our customers, because every customer eventually will embrace and adopt AI tools and technology. So we are -- as small company as we are, we're still ahead of the curve because we don't want to be left behind. So we are investing in those areas. And then, of course, we continue to invest in the younger, new generation because some are being retired. We're bringing new fresh blood in programming, new tools, equipment, all the digital mobility platform. So there's lots going on. This company is not only a technology company, but also it has a vision for the innovation. And the last thing we want to be is left behind in the curve. This company is always ahead of the curve, making the investment in the right place. And that takes cash and investment. And -- but we are streamlining our headcount completely all over the globe, not just in Pakistan. So all in all, I feel very comfortable about our strategy. We will execute what we promised this year and we'll get stronger and stronger in coming years.\nTodd Felte: All right. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll hop back in the queue. Thank you.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Sure. You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Najeeb Ghauri for any closing comments.\nNajeeb Ghauri: Thank you for joining us today. I especially want to thank our investors for their continued support, our loyal customers and our most dedicated employees worldwide for their ongoing contributions. We will look forward to updating our call -- our earnings call next call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
