There's an opportunity for question-and-answer session at the end. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Stefan Chkautovich, CFO of Southern Missouri Bancorp. Please go ahead.\nStefan Chkautovich : Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. This is Stefan Chkautovich, CFO with Southern Missouri Bancorp. Thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to review the information and data presented in our quarterly earnings release dated Monday, January 29, 2024, and to take your questions. We may make certain forward-looking statements during today's call, and we refer you to our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements contained in the press release. I'm joined on the call today by Greg Steffens, our Chairman and CEO; and Matt Funke, President and Chief Administrative Officer. Matt will lead off our conversation today with some highlights from our most recent quarter.\nMatt Funke : Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. This is Matt Funke. Thanks for joining us. I'll start off with the highlights from our December quarter, the second quarter of our fiscal year. Quarter-over-quarter profitability was down a bit as the higher cost of funds weighed on our margin, but for this current environment, we remain relatively pleased with the results and the outlook ahead. We've absorbed the largest part of the impact of the prior year's sharp increase in short-term rates, and we've seen 22.1% net interest income growth year-over-year due to a larger balance sheet with the addition of the Citizens loan and securities portfolio early in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, along with continued solid deposit and loan growth so far this fiscal year. We earned $1.07 diluted in the December quarter, that's down $0.09 from the linked September quarter and down $0.19 from the December 2022 quarter. During the quarter, the bank executed a securities loss trade, selling bonds with a book value of $12.4 million, realizing a loss of $682,000, or $0.05 of earnings per fully diluted share after tax. These proceeds were reinvested into $11.9 million of higher rate bonds, which are expected to result in an earn-back of the realized loss in less than two years. Excluding this loss for the quarter, non-interest income would have been $6.3 million, net income after tax, $12.7 million, earnings per diluted share of $1.12 and our return on average assets would have been 1.12%. Book value per share was $41.66 and has increased by $4.98 or 13.6% over the last 12 months with AOCI roughly unchanged since the year ago period. Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.25% as compared to 3.45% reported for the year ago period and 3.44% reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. This decrease was attributable to a higher cost of deposits as well as an increase in cash balances. Net interest income was down 2.6% quarter-over-quarter and up 22.1% year-over-year as we grew average earning asset balances. We had a slightly lower amount of margin benefit from accretion of purchase accounting marks in the current quarter as compared to the linked quarter and a larger benefit as compared to the year ago period, which was just in advance of the Citizens merger. On the balance sheet, gross loan balances increased by $32 million during the second quarter compared to one year ago at December 31, 2022, gross balances were up $737 million or 25%. The Citizens merger, which closed during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, accounted for $447 million of net year-over-year growth and our adjusted annual growth rate over those 12 months adjusting out the acquired Citizens loans would be a little under 10%. Due to strong deposit growth quarter-over-quarter, cash and equivalents grew $128 million and compared to December 31, 2022, cash and equivalents are up $162 million. Deposit balances increased by almost $154 million in the second quarter and increased by $989 million compared to December 31 of the prior year. That included an $851 million increase net of fair value attributable to the Citizens merger, which again was during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Strong growth in deposits this quarter was a result of CD and savings account growth from well-received special rates offered during the quarter as well as seasonal deposit inflows. With all that, I'll hand it over to Greg for some discussion on credit.\nGreg Steffens: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report. Overall, our asset quality remains strong as of December 31, with adversely classified assets at $39 million or a little over 1% of total loans, a decrease of about $3 million or 10 basis points over the last quarter. Non-performing loans were $5.9 million in 12/31, which is relatively flat compared to last quarter and totaled 0.16% of gross loans. In comparison to December of 2022, non-performing loans increased a little over $1 million, but in line as a percentage of total loans outstanding. Loans past due 30 to 89 days were $7 million, down nearly $20 million from September and at a low 19 basis points on gross loans. This is a decrease of 53 basis points compared to the linked quarter and down 5 basis points from one year ago. Total delinquent loans were a $0.3 million, down $20 million from September. This quarter's drop in past due and delinquent loans is primarily from the chair of the large relationship that was delinquent that we noted in last quarter's call. As compared to the prior quarter ended September 30, ag real estate balances were down nearly $2 million, and they were up $15 million compared to December 31 a year ago. Ag production and equipment loan balances were down $18 million over the quarter due to normal seasonality, but they were up $33 million year-over-year due in part to Citizens acquired loans and the slower marketing periods for some of our farmers this year. In the 2023 agricultural seats at our farmers experienced a successful harvest with above-average yields, particularly in cotton, rice and corn. Despite facing a similar drought in most markets, water availability for irrigation contributed to better than average yields. Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate our farmers will diversify their crop specifically away from corn due to the combination of lower corn prices, the impact of the 2023 drought on river levels, and higher input costs that all have contributed to more anticipated expense for that crop. While rice cultivation is expected to increase, cotton farmers aim to maintain production levels and soybean acres will likely remain stable. Financial reviews indicate that most farmers will meet their 2023 obligations, but are entering 2024 with somewhat lower working capital than the prior year, attributed to declining commodity prices, drought impacts, and increased input costs. Still, we feel good about the agricultural segment of our portfolio. During the renewal season, we conduct stress tests on our farm cash flows, ensuring strong underwriting of these credits as we move into new production lines. Looking at the loan portfolio as a whole, gross loans grew $32 million or 3.5% annualized during the quarter. We are in the slowest part of the year for loan growth due to seasonal factors, especially related to agriculture. The bank experienced some well-rounded growth stemming from multifamily, non-owner-occupied CRE, C&I, construction, and owner-occupied one to four family. This loan growth was led by our west and south regions, which are in good growth markets. We are continuing to prioritize making credit available to our core clients. Between that and normal winter seasonality, we would not anticipate seeing much net loan growth during the March quarter, even though our pipeline continues to include many construction line draws. That said, due to improved liquidity, stable credit, and increasing commercial demand, we expect to opportunistically evaluate additional high quality credits that could lead to a real pickup in loan growth this summer. Our pipeline for loans to fund in the next 90 days totaled $141 million at quarter end as compared to $158 million at September 30th and $122 million one year ago. Our volume of loan originations was approximately $242 million in the December quarter, an increase of $12 million as compared to the September quarter. In the December quarter a year ago, we originated $281 million. The leading categories this quarter for lending were C&I and multifamily. Our non-owner-occupied CRE concentration at the bank level was approximately 323% of Tier 1 capital and allowance for credit losses at 12/31, down by one percentage point as compared to September 30th. Stefan?\nStefan Chkautovich: Thanks, Greg. Matt hit some of the key financial items already, but I wanted to share a few details. Looking at this quarter's net interest margin of 3.25%, it included about 14 basis points of fair value discount accretion on acquired loan portfolios and premium amortization on assumed deposits compared to the linked September quarter of 16 basis points and the prior year's December quarter of 6 basis points. The primary contributor to the net interest market compression compared to the linked-quarter was the increase in the cost of deposits by 42 basis points to 2.61%, primarily led by CDE and savings specials, which partially offset from lower FHLB balances. At the end of last quarter, we paid off all overnight borrowings. In total, the cost of liabilities increased 38 basis points to 3.11%. In comparison, our yield on average earning assets was up only 15 basis points in the same period. As our asset repricing lags the impact of higher rates more than our liabilities, we continue to see some net interest margin pressure through the quarter, which resulted in the net interest margin for the month of December being modestly lower than the quarter average. The monthly compression has slowed as a significant percentage of the CD portfolio now rolling over each month has already been impacted by higher rates offered in periods following the sharp move higher in short-term rates. Also, we have reduced special deposit rates offered as we balance availability of liquidity and near-term loan growth expectations, as we have seen an inflection point in the competitive landscape for deposits. Looking at our liabilities that are repricing in comparison to our earning assets, we could continue to see some additional pressure. With this coming stream, we are optimistic that we should see our margins lower. If deposit competition does not re-escalate, the reduced day count in March quarter will have a small negative impact on quarterly net interest income. Lastly, on the net interest margin and net interest income, we are liability sensitive. If the FOMC does start cutting rates this year, we would expect to be a net beneficiary of those cuts especially if the slope of the yield curve would normalize somewhat. Noninterest income had some noise in the quarter from the loss trade we executed, with the resulting loss of $682,000. Excluding this, noninterest income would have been up almost 16% as compared to the year ago period, primarily due to the Citizens merger in fiscal 3Q and up 8% compared to the September linked quarter. In linked quarter, the increase was from several categories of loan fees and other noninterest income increased as a result of a settlement of legal speeds settled in the bank's favor with total impact of 85,000. This was partially offset by lower wealth and trust management income. Although not impacting the quarterly comparison, we will continue to have a drag on year-over-year comparisons due to NSF policy changes we adopted in July 2023, our first fiscal quarter on how we assess fees for some items that resulted in a reduction of fee income. Noninterest expense was up 35.3% compared to the year ago quarter due to the larger expense base with the addition of the Citizens and up 0.6% compared to the linked quarter. In comparison to the linked quarter, the bank benefited from having no material merger charges. Last quarter, we had about $134,000 mostly in our other expense line. That benefit was more than offset by higher compensation and benefits from an increased headcount and the associated expenses with higher FTE. We would expect to see another quarterly increase in compensation expense in the March quarter as annual merit increases and cost of living adjustments take effect. As indicated on the last earnings call, we had a slight uptick in occupancy expense as we relocated personnel to better positioned offices in our Kansas City market. As Greg mentioned, credit remains benign, but we did see an uptick in net charge-offs for the quarter to 10 basis points annualized, still a very solid performance by comparison to historical industry figures. About half of these charge-offs were related from one real estate relationship from the Citizens merger. Our provision for credit losses was $900,000 in the quarter as compared to $1.1 million in the same period for the prior year and in line with the linked quarter. Our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023, was $50.1 million or 1.34% of gross loans and 846%  of non-performing loans as compared to an ACL of $49.1 million or 1.33% of gross loans and 856% of non-performing loans at September 30, 2023, the linked quarter. The current period PCL was the result of a $1.9 million provision attributable to the ACL for loan balances outstanding, partially offset by a recovery of $1 million, provision attributable to allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure. This was due to the construction draws reducing the available credit and increasing our balance or on balance sheet exposure. Our assessment of the economic outlook was little changed. Despite some of the challenges over the last few quarters, as the bank navigated this higher interest rate environment impacting our margin, slowing the overall economy and resulting in lower loan originations and secondary market fees, we feel optimistic about margin and overall earnings for the June quarter and beyond, if we remain in a benign credit environment. Greg, any closing thoughts?\nGreg Steffens: Thanks, Stefan. We're now a year past our merger with Citizens Bancshares and 11 months past the systems conversion. We remain focused on core deposit retention in those markets and elsewhere and have seen steady improvements over the quarters and how we're integrating those team members into our operations and procedures. And our team is doing a great job. We have achieved the cost savings we had anticipated at the merger. And from here forward, we are looking to expand in our metro markets. As Stefan noted, and we are also looking to recruit community bankers in some of our new markets, so there could be modest incremental upticks in non-interest expense. We are 100% committed to providing our excellent services in the more rural and middle market communities we added through the Citizens merger in addition to the Kansas City metro area. We're not currently actively pursuing additional merger opportunities. That being said, continued regulatory and macroeconomic factors pressuring other banks could eventually lead to an uptick in potential interested partners.\nMatt Funke: Thank you, Greg. At this time, Kathy, we're ready to take questions from our participants. So if you would, please remind folks how they make queue for questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kelly Motta of KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKelly Motta: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I think maybe starting out you noted that you repositioned a small portion of your securities book during the quarter. Just wondering the timing of it relative within that December quarter one as well as to appetite for -- at the margin potentially doing another piece as we look ahead.\nStefan Chkautovich: We completed the repositioning of those securities in mid to late December. So we didn't see much of an impact in the December's results at all from the securities transaction. And we would anticipate that we're going to continue to evaluate whether we do a little more.\nGreg Steffens: Kelly, it's pretty limited as to the dollar amount of securities that we have that's had a low enough yield where it's made a lot of sense for it, but there is a little bit additional that we could clean up there.\nKelly Motta: Got it. I appreciate it. And then I think when we last spoke last quarter at this time, you were looking for mid single-digit loan growth. It seems like near-term need, the ag seasonality might be slow, but you noted you expect a pick up in the summer. Just wondering is mid single digits over -- for the full fiscal year, still something that you think is a reasonable expectation?\nGreg Steffens: Yes, I think going forward, we would anticipate somewhere between 3% to 5% annual growth. So if you look at our 12 to 31 figures, we'd look at another 3% to 5% over the course of calendar year 2024.\nKelly Motta: Got it. Appreciate it. Maybe one or two more from me. On the deposit side, it looks like one-third of the growth was from public deposits. Can you remind us any seasonality with that? And as we look ahead, you mentioned that margin, the month-over-month trends appear to be stabilizing, which is good. Just kind of where incrementally you're adding on the rate at which you're adding on new deposits? And do you think in order to get a stabilization in the cost? Does it take a rate cut or provided that were likely done with rate cuts, should we -- would you still expect a stabilization there in funding costs?\nGreg Steffens: So on the public units, yes, we did have some dollars come in this quarter. We would expect some of those to go back out. It's always a little tricky to know exactly how that will play out. We do have some new public unit customers from our merger that was just out a year ago now. So we're not 100% familiar with what their flows would be. But definitely some of that growth would wash back out in the March quarter. Margin overall, we have reduced our CD specials a little bit, some savings products are really stable. But where we look at how much in CDs has already absorbed the higher pricing. We really feel pretty good that we're past an inflection point on the pace of those increases and really ought to see as long as rates stay here or move lower, that we obvious see a decrease in the uptick on cost of funds.\nKelly Motta: Great. Thank you. I'll step back. Appreciate it.\nMatt Funke: Thanks, Kelly\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Liesch of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Liesch: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess this might be related to the public funds question, but cash balances were a little bit elevated at year-end. I'm just curious what -- is that what drove that? And any plan for these funds for this cash here going forward?\nGreg Steffens: Yeah. We would expect, obviously, to use some of that to fund outflows on any of those seasonal deposits, some of it would fund our seasonal ag book as we move through the first half of calendar 2024. Some of it is just we did a little better than we had anticipated in the second half of calendar 2023 with deposit specials. So we're pulling the reins back a little bit on that. It wouldn't surprise us if we have some deposit outflows as some of those specials reprice again. But we do have some brokered funding that long-term. We wouldn't like to maintain at the same levels we are. And then as Stefan and Greg both noted, we would look to be incrementally a little more optimistic about loan growth as we get into the middle of calendar 2024.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. All right. That's helpful. And then Stefan, did you quantify what eats 25 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate could do to the margin? I'm sorry if I missed that, if you did? All else equal.\nStefan Chkautovich: No. I didn't quantify 25 basis points. But on a big picture, 100 basis points on a static balance sheet would be about a mid single-digit benefit to net interest income and with our sort of budgeted growth, it would be about low single-digit benefit.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. Got it. That's right. You guys have covered all my questions. Thanks.\nGreg Steffens: Thanks, Andrew.\nMatt Funke: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no additional questions waiting at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Southern Missouri Bancorp, CFO; Stefan Chkautovich for closing remarks.\nStefan Chkautovich: Thanks, Kathy, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Appreciate your interest in the company and speak again in about three months. Have a good day.\nGreg Steffens: Everybody, have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us for today's call. Have a great rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand the call over to CFO, Stefan Chkautovich to begin. Stefan, please go ahead, and you are ready.\nStefan Chkautovich: Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. This is Stefan Chkautovich, CFO with Southern Missouri Bancorp. Thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to review the information and data presented in our quarterly earnings release dated Monday, October 23, 2023, and to take your questions. We may make certain forward-looking statements during today's call and we refer you to our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements contained in the press release. I'm joined on the call today with Greg Steffens, our Chairman and CEO; and Matt Funke, President and Chief Administrative Officer. Matt will lead off our conversation today with some highlights from our most recent quarter.\nMatthew Funke: Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. This is Matt Funke. Thanks for joining us. I'll start off with highlights on our financial results from the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year. Quarter-over-quarter, we did show some pressure in profitability at higher cost of funds as well as lower fees tied to loans, mortgage and transaction accounts weighed on results. But for this current environment, we're relatively pleased with those. Offsetting some of this pressure was lower reported non-interest expense from lower merger-related costs as well as other operating expenses in the September quarter. Despite challenges, the bank was still able to report an 11.5% year-over-year increase in diluted EPS, due primarily to a reduction from the larger provision for credit losses posted in September of 2022. That diluted EPS figure for the current quarter was $1.16, down $0.21 from the linked June quarter, but up $0.12 from the year ago September quarter. Our annualized return on average assets was 1.2%, while annualized return on average common equity was 11.7%. Those compared to 1.16% ROA and 11.7% ROE in the same quarter a year ago, and 1.44% ROA and 14.1% ROE in the linked June quarter. Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.44%, down from the 3.65% reported for the year ago period and down from the 3.60% reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, the linked quarter. Net interest income was down 2% quarter-over-quarter and up 24% year-over-year as we grew average earning asset balances. We had a similar amount of margin impact from non-core items in the current quarter as compared to the linked quarter, but our reported margin was improved on a year-over-year basis by the non-core items compared to September of 2022. On the balance sheet, gross loan balances increased by almost $81 million during the first quarter and by $723 million over the prior 12 months, with 12-month figure, including a $447 million increase outside of -- inclusive of fair value adjustments that were attributable to the Citizens merger, which had closed in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Loans anticipated to fund in the next 90 days were $158 million at September 30. Deposit balances increased by $115.6 million during the first quarter of '24 and they increased by $990 million over the prior 12 months, which included $851 million attributable to the Citizens merger during the third quarter of fiscal '23. Solid growth in deposits this quarter was the result of CD and savings account increases from well-received special rates offered during the quarter, and we did utilize some brokered funding early in the quarter. FHLB advances were $114 million at September 30, a decrease of just under $20 million from June 30, as we repaid all our overnight borrowings and lowered the bank's reliance on non-core funding. We took a net increase of about $14 million in term FHLB borrowings during the quarter. But compared to a year ago, our FHLB balances are down by $111 million. I'll now hand it over to Greg for some discussion on credit.\nGreg Steffens: Thank you, Matt and good morning, everyone. Overall, our asset quality remained strong at September 30, with adversely classified assets standing at $42.5 million or 1.15% of total loans, which represents a decrease of around $3.8 million or 13 basis points during the quarter. Non-performing loans were $5.7 million at September 30, down $2 million compared to June 30 and decreasing to 0.16% of gross loans. In comparison to September 2022, non-performing loans increased $1.8 million and are up 3 basis points on total loans. Loans past due 30 to 89 days were $26.7 million, up $19.7 million from June and at 72 basis points of gross loans. This is an increase of 53 basis points compared to the linked quarter and 57 basis points compared to a year ago. Of this increase, 96% relates to a single borrower group relationship with notes that are past maturity are not renewed due to a dispute among the partnership, which prevented timely renewal. We expect this dispute to be resolved and the delinquency to be resolved during the December quarter. The relationship is not criticized or classified and we do not anticipate any loss to the bank resulting from this dispute. Guarantor strength provides substantial network and liquidity. Overall, total delinquent loans at September 30 were $28.4 million, up $17.7 million from June. From June 30, ag real estate balances were up $1.8 million over the quarter and up $22.3 million compared to the same quarter a year ago, while agricultural production loans increased $26.3 million for the quarter and $24.2 million over the prior year. Our agricultural customers continue to make great progress on their '23 crop harvest, and we'll likely see many of them finish their corn and rice harvest in October and have a significant amount of their soybean and cotton harvested by month end, perhaps into mid-November. Very dry conditions this fall have allowed our borrowers to move forward more quickly than normal with their harvest. For the most part, we feel that our farmers were able to get through this year's drought conditions, and our lenders are reporting average to above average yields on most crops on their irrigated farm land. However, this did drive expenses higher. Farmers continue to face higher seed, fuel, fertilizer and chemical costs this growing season. And unlike last year, prices have not trended above the levels they received for the prior year crops. Farmers that have on-farm storage will likely be delayed hauling their grain to fulfill contracts due to lower Mississippi River terminal levels until river stages return to a more normal level. Fortunately, farmers can utilize the USDA's CCC loan program to get loans on stored grain so that they can at least pay down a portion of the traditional borrowing lines until brand can be marketed. The farmers holding a good portion of their corn and soybean crops until spring, we anticipate we may see smaller paydowns than normal on some of our borrowing lines for the quarter ending in December. For the crop year crop banking reach mix was about 30% corn, 25% soybeans, 20% rice and cotton, and 5% other specialty crops. Corn prices have dropped since earlier this year, especially on the spot market, they may stay lower until the Mississippi River levels come back up for full barge traffic. Rice has strong pricing and it's too early to project how soybeans will end up this year. Generally, we expect our farm lines will pay out for 2023 and anticipate lower working capital positions. There may be a small number of farmers that suffered yield losses on their dry land farms this year that may struggle to meet some of their term payments. However, should they not meet all their term payments, most will have sufficient equity to be able to successfully restructure any shortfall. Speaking in the loan portfolio as a whole, the portfolio grew $79.5 million or 8.9% annualized, net of ACL during the quarter. This loan growth was led by our East region where we have a bunch of our agricultural activity. Our South region was just behind the East with good growth in those markets. We are continuing to focus on making credit available to our core clients between that and seasonal ag lines paying down, we wouldn't expect to see much net loan growth in the December quarter, even though we will continue to fund construction line drops. Our pipeline for loans to fund in the next 90 days totaled $158 million at quarter end as compared to $135 million at June 30 and $230 million one year ago. Our volume of loan originations was approximately $230 million in the September quarter, a decrease of $43 million as compared to the June quarter. In the September quarter a year ago, we originated $436 million in loans. The leading categories this quarter for loan production with commercial, non-residential real estate and ag production. Our non-owner occupied CRE concentration levels at the bank level was approximately 324% of Tier 1 capital and the allowance for credit losses at September 30, down by 6 percentage points as compared to June 30. Stefan?\nStefan Chkautovich: Thanks, Greg. Going into a little more detail on the income statement. Matt mentioned our margin of 3.44%. Our net interest income for the quarter was $35.4 million, an increase of $6.9 million or 24.2% as compared to the same quarter a year ago. The increase was attributable to a 31.6% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets compared to the same period a year ago, partially offset by a 21 basis point decrease in net interest margin, as we work to improve on balance sheet liquidity, leading to a higher cost of funds. Net interest income from loan discount accretion and deposit amortization resulting from the company's acquisitions contributed 16 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter. Unchanged from the impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the linked quarter and up from a 7 basis point contribution in the same quarter a year ago. Recognition of deferred origination fees on PPP loans was immaterial across these periods. On what we view as core, we then see margin down 30 basis points year-over-year and down 16 basis points sequentially. Compared to June, the 92 day quarter in September helped add about 3 basis points of reported margin. Non-interest income was up a little more than 6% compared to the year ago period, but down 34.6% compared to the linked quarter. We saw a significant reduction in NSF charges as we change policy on how we assess fees for some items. Bank card interchange income was back down to a more normalized level after seasonal benefits in the quarter. So non-recurring charges related to lending offset some application fee income in the quarter as well. We'll show a bounce back from those, but the NSF charges will be a headwind. Mortgage banking activity also remains low. Non-interest expense was up 40.1% as compared to the year ago period, but down 4.7% from the linked quarter as non-recurring merger charges dropped to $134,000 as compared to $829,000 in the linked quarter. The year-ago quarter also included a modest amount of M&A charges at $169,000. There wasn't a lot in the quarter that we consider unusual otherwise. We'll see an uptick in compensation beginning in January, and we will have a little bit of occupancy cost increase in the coming quarters as we relocate some personnel into better position offices in our newer metro markets. Our provision for credit losses was $900,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as compared to a PCL of $5.1 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the linked June quarter, it was $795,000. The PCL in the year ago period was impacted by substantial loan growth during that quarter, as well as a modest decline in the modeled economic outlook. The company's assessment of the economic outlook at September 30, 2023 was little change as compared to the assessment of the June 30, 2023. Qualitative adjustments in our ACL model were slightly decreased based on a reduced pace of loan growth, but we did increase adjustments relative to a small group of classified hotel loans. Net charge-offs remained at a low level during the quarter, with our trailing 12-month net charge-offs running at 3 basis points. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2023, totaled $49.1 million, representing 1.33% of gross loans and 856% of non-performing loans as compared to an ACL of $47.8 million, which represented 1.32% of gross loans and 625% of non-performing loans in our June 30, 2023 fiscal year end. Our earnings release included a more detailed table of deposit trends over the last year. On a quarterly basis for total deposits, exclusive of brokered funds, we had solid growth. This was primarily due to well received rate specials ran in the quarter for savings in CDs. We're also pleased to see more stable non-interest bearing deposit loans. We used core growth and brokered funding to meet seasonal loan demand while reducing reliance on FHLB funding during this quarter. Matt noted earlier, the elimination of our overnight position and reduction from a year ago in FHLB borrowings. It's especially notable that we did so in the September quarter as we currently are at our peak loan demand and trough deposits funding position on the calendar. Going into the fourth calendar quarter, we are entering a period which we see further deposit growth from ag, the general business cycles, and public funds, which is based on the tax cycle in our areas. While we want to remain cautious about the liquidity outlook in the current quarter, if normal trends hold, we may look at further reductions in non-core funding, such as broker deposits. Looking into full year fiscal 2024, we anticipate continued solid levels of profitability, though the lag effect of the Fed's rate increases will still pressure margin over the next quarter or so. We're optimistic if the Fed is done with significant rate hikes we saw over the prior period that we should see a trough over the next two quarters. Greg, any closing thoughts?\nGreg Steffens: Thanks, Stefan. Right now, we're now nine months past our merger with Citizens Bancshares and eight months past the systems conversion. We remain focused on deposit retention in those markets and elsewhere and have seen steady improvements over the last quarter and how we're integrating those team members into our operations and procedures. The team is doing a fine job. We have achieved the cost savings we had anticipated in the merger. And from here forward, we are repositioning some of our office locations, as Stefan noted, and we are also looking to recoup community bankers in some of our new markets. So there could be modest incremental upticks in non-interest expense. We are 100% committed to providing our excellent services in the more rural and middle market communities we added to our partnership with Citizens in addition to the Kansas City metro area. We're not currently actively pursuing additional merger opportunities, I would expect that other than under very unique circumstances, we'll stay on the sidelines for a bit longer. That said, continued regulatory and macroeconomic factors pressuring banks could eventually lead to an uptick in potential interest of partners.\nMatthew Funke: Thank you, Greg. At this time, Adam, we're ready to take questions from our participants. So if you would, please remind folks how they make queue for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler. Andrew, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Liesch: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Welcome, Stefan. Thanks for taking the questions here. The CD specials that you were running, any more details on those what were you -- what was some of the rates and the terms and are those ongoing here into this quarter?\nMatthew Funke: They are ongoing, Andrew. We were primarily marketing shorter-term CDs, 15 months and in which rates up to 5.5% where we had taken some brokered funding in the prior quarter, early in this quarter, summed up with some longer-term brokered funding that we would have added to try to balance out the latter there.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. And so [indiscernible] both campaigns are continuing, so we expect to see more CV growth here this quarter? And is that kind of leading to that margin compression that you talked about with the guidance in the near term?\nMatthew Funke: Yeah. It certainly has contributed and will continue to contribute there. It has continued into this quarter. We've dialed back just a little bit. We'll continue to look at how aggressive we need to be on that pricing relative to our funding position.\nAndrew Liesch: Got you. And then looking out to the rest of the fiscal year on loan growth and decent growth here. But it sounds like the pipeline is down certainly compared to a year ago. I guess, what sort of growth rate do you expect and what are your clients telling you for like for their credit demand and needs for the next 12 months?\nGreg Steffens: We're really looking at muted growth for the current quarter and the following quarter, which are traditionally our lowest growth quarters, and then we'll have a fair amount of uptick in activity again in the final quarter of our fiscal year, as Ag lines grow again, we draw about $20 million a month in construction draws that will maintain a lot of our current balances for the next six months.\nMatthew Funke: Overall for the year, Andrew, probably in the mid-single digits for percentage growth.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. Yeah. It makes sense. Thanks for taking the questions here. I’ll step back.\nMatthew Funke: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kelly Motta from KBW. Kelly, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKelly Motta: Hey. Good morning. Nice to hear from both of you, Greg and Matt as always, and nice to have Stefan joining us. Welcome. I was hoping you could refresh us a bit on loan portfolio repricing about how much of that portfolio comes due this year? And can you provide where new loans are coming on just so we can get a sense of what further lift we might see on the loan yield side?\nGreg Steffens: Loan production is coming on primarily 8.25%, 8.5% for link production and monthly, I would anticipate, on average, we would have roughly $50 million a month maturing that would be repricing higher.\nMatthew Funke: Prepayments could add to that Kelly.\nKelly Motta: Got it. That's helpful. And then in your prepared remarks, Greg, I think you mentioned that you're looking to add new teams to certain markets. Can you provide to kind of -- are there any particular markets in particular that you're looking to add talented and where are you seeing the greatest opportunity for growth, either through the addition of new teams or through current organic production.\nGreg Steffens: When we partnered with Citizens, there were several other rural outstate markets are outside of Kansas City area that they did not have any lending teams in place. We are looking for lending personnel in several of those more rural markets. So that would include potentially Chile Cate (ph), Brookfield, [indiscernible] Boonville or Trenton, Missouri. We probably would not sell someone in all those markets, but we are looking for talent, but at present, we're just in the looking for stage.\nKelly Motta: Got it. That's helpful. And then in terms of capital, I mean, levels are pretty solid here. In terms of capital priorities, it seems like M&A might there may not be that many opportunities near term, although you're looking. Can you just walk us through your priorities for capital? Is the idea there really to save any dry powder for what deals may lie ahead in addition to organic growth pr is there any appetite for buyback here?\nGreg Steffens: I would really not anticipate us to initiate any type of buyback. I would see us building more of a capital work test, so to speak, for deployment in future acquisitions.\nKelly Motta: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe last question for me. Looking at these, I know you had the kind of non-recurring benefit last quarter. It looks like one area on a core basis that may have pulled back was deposit service charges. Was there -- is that just a function of activity or was there any repricing of -- on your side that kind of drove that lower? Just trying to get a sense if that's a good number to start off as or if we should kind of have that snapping back to where it was in both prior two quarters of your last full year.\nMatthew Funke: We would expect that to probably move lower than what those last couple of quarters were. Kelly, we've adopted some policy changes on the items that we do charge for. So that will be downtick in the run rate there.\nKelly Motta: Got it. Thank you so much for the color. I’ll step back.\nMatthew Funke: You’re very welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] As we have no further questions, so I'll hand the call back to the management team for any concluding remarks.\nMatthew Funke: Thank you, Adam, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate your interest, and we'll speak again in three months. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines."
