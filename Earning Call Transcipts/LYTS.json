A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jim Galeese. Thank you. You may begin.\nJim Galeese: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. We issued a press release before the market opened this morning, detailing our fiscal '24 second quarter results. In addition to this release, we posted a conference call presentation in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Information contained in this presentation will be referenced throughout today's conference call, included are certain non-GAAP measures for improved transparency of our operating results. A complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is contained in our press release and 10-Q. Please note that management's commentary and responses to today's questions on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements about our business outlook. Such statements involve risks and opportunities and actual results could differ materially. I refer you to our safe harbor statement, which appears in this morning's press release as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. Today's call will begin with remarks summarizing our fiscal second quarter results. At the conclusion of these prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to LSI President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Clark.\nJim Clark: Thank you, Jim, and good morning all. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As noted in our press release issued earlier today, LSI continues to perform well and in line with our expectations despite some temporary headwinds in our grocery vertical. In our Lighting segment, sales were down 3% for the quarter on prior year sales, while gross margin improved meaningfully to 35%. This performance both in sales and margin reflects our continued ability to manage the business and take share even while we are in a challenging year-over-year comparison and general business environment. Our quote and order activity remains high, up almost 10% from last year while our conversion rate from quote to sales remains extended but stable. While the broader lighting market in many of our competitors have struggled to maintain top-line momentum, LSI has been successful in finding and creating opportunities for growth and we remain focused on profitable sales.  In our Display Solutions segment, the headwinds in the grocery vertical have had broader impact as they have challenged momentum in our graphics, standalone displays and refrigerated products. This impact is more apparent when compared to our lighting segment. As we noted a few months back, we recently awarded a significant win in our Display Solutions Group in the refueling space with 1,325 sites set to span three years and another award that will include more than 7,000 locations averaging 700 to 1000 sites per year. This project will span considerably longer. Our normal flow of business in this space and the overall refueling vertical feels very robust right now. In addition to these recent project wins, we are currently engaged with two major C-store customers who are multi-site testing our refrigerated product in a number of locations. In fact, a recent article published in last month's Wall Street Journal underlines our thesis of continued growth in this segment and the solutions approach offered by LSI fits very well. The article is titled Gas with a Side of Pizza and it goes to underline the opportunity, the investment in the higher margin sales that accompany a traditional gas station by engaging in-store sales. We are very experienced and recognized in this space as a high quality solutions provider and we're confident we will have continued notable wins.  Addressing the slowdown in the grocery vertical specifically, I would like to note that two of the largest grocery chains in the U.S. are currently engaged in a proposed merger. This merger has been under an extended federal regulatory review process and has caused a temporary slowdown across the entire grocery vertical as companies within this sector await the results of the review and the possible changes to the competitive landscape.  Although it's impossible to see what the future will hold in this space and the timing associated with the approval process, we anticipate that there will be continued growth and pent-up demand as the merger process moves forward. While we are disappointed with the time this process is taking, we believe that whether the merger occurs or fails to move forward, it will likely generate significant opportunity for additional business as the landscape continues to evolve and change. These changes that help our customers engage and retain customers fit very well with the products and services LSI offers, and we will be prepared to serve this market now and into the future.  On the new products front, LSI continues to set the bar in new product introductions and innovation. Staying on pace with our 20 plus new product introductions or product revisions each of the last five years, I'm proud to say that, our new R-290 environmentally sustainable refrigerated product was DoE or Department of Energy certified and UL approved earlier this month and our first article has already shipped to one of our customers. Interest in this product is very high and we anticipate continued growth with this solutions as customers test the effectiveness with R-290 in their own store environment. Turning to our Lighting segment. We recently introduced two completely new lighting products, including our linear aerial outdoor lighting product and our new Peak Series High Bay light, which is a modular product that includes a rotatable light engine and lens that can be rotated 180 degrees in fixed 30 degree increments. These products not only expand our broad solution set, but allow our customers and agents to access unique lighting solutions that showcase their properties and their business. Next week, LSI will be hosting our National Sales Conference. This annual meeting provides an elevated forum for our sales, marketing, engineering and product development teams to meet, discuss, debate and create opportunities. This is a real learning experience for our team and our company and we always gain momentum coming off of this conference.  I'm proud of the work the team is doing and I feel we have a lot of opportunities in front of us. There is no question the impact across the entirety of our grocery vertical is causing some headwinds, but I feel the team has pivoted quite effectively to offset a majority of those headwinds and we are enthusiastic about the possible tailwinds we could experience, as this process works its way to conclusion. We have the capabilities and the capacity to respond and we are excited about the ongoing improvements to our business and the possibilities that lie ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jim Galeese for a deeper look at our overall financial performance. Jim?\nJim Galeese: Thank you, Jim. Our fiscal second quarter results reflect ongoing strong execution in key vertical markets, while managing the expected temporary demand disruption in the grocery vertical. We maintained a steadfast focus on quality of earnings, including successfully managing selling price and product cost. These efforts generated a year-over-year 240 basis point improvement in gross margin and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.1% equal to prior year on lower sales. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, earnings per share were $0.50 equal to the prior year first half.  The business again generated over $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, further reducing debt now under $19 million and lower the TTM ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt to 0.4x. Our cash flow and debt position support our capital allocation priorities and provides the balance sheet optionality for future investments.  One of those priorities includes investing in profitable organic growth. Investment in critical capital programs was over $3 million for the first half of for fiscal year. Investments were spread across both lighting and display solutions and included key machinery and tooling to support new products, increased operating capacity, throughput and productivity. In addition, we remain committed to a balanced approach for driving shareholder value, announcing a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share to be paid on February 13th for shareholders of record February 5th.  Now, a few comments on segment performance. Momentum continues in our Lighting segment. Operating income increased 28% year-over-year on sales of $65 million or 3% below last year. We continue to outperform the broader market further improving our share position. The lighting gross margin rate improved significantly, increasing 440 basis points to 35% with multiple items contributing to the rate expansion. Items include a higher value mix, stable pricing, moderately lower material input costs, value engineering and manufacturing productivity.  Lighting orders for the quarter were 10% above prior year. Increasing the backlog as we enter fiscal Q3. Quote activity remains favorable as our key verticals continue to generate higher activity rates than the broader non-resi construction market. Our team has done an effective job managing the timing variability in the quote-to-order conversion cycle, constructing our supply chain and production planning to allow for fluctuating demand patterns. We expect lighting momentum to continue in the second half of the fiscal year.  Moving to Display Solutions, second quarter performance reflects the disruption in project activity throughout the grocery vertical. We continue to work closely with our customers on project timing with several large projects in turnkey position waiting on release. We use this disruption period to prepare for the return to normal demand activity. Relocation and startup of our new refrigeration production facility is complete and operational. And as Jim mentioned, we received final UL approval on the new environmentally friendly R-290 display case. The first customer unit shipped last week.  Our backlog in the refueling C-store vertical has increased significantly in the last several quarters. In fiscal Q2, a large oil company awarded LSI the brand refresh program for over 1,300 locations. Program is structured for LSI to be the turnkey provider responsible for site planning through installation. We're seeing an increasing trend in programs requesting or requiring turnkey solutions, as customers recognize the value of our comprehensive solution capabilities. Looking forward, we expect Q3 Display Solutions sales to increase modestly from Q2 levels, performance will vary by vertical with refueling graphics increasing as site release activity begins on several major programs. Refueling activity is projected to remain strong throughout calendar year '24 and '25. As project release activity begins to occur, grocery sales will increase somewhat sequentially in Q3 from Q2, but remain below prior year. Grocery project activity is expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter and into fiscal '25. Our focus and priorities for Q3 remain the same, advancing our strategic growth initiatives, exhibit smart, disciplined, business execution and effectively managing cash debt and capital allocation. The underlying trend for our target markets remain positive and we are confident in our plans moving forward. I will now return the call back to the moderator for the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Spychalla with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nAaron Spychalla: First, for me on, C-stores, good commentary on the move to fresh food that's happening there and initial progress on the cross-selling. Can you just talk about, maybe how big that opportunity can be with those initial customers and over time as we look out a couple of years?\nOperator: I believe the speakers were disconnected. I think they're dialing back in now. Okay. Bear with us, and we will get the conference back. Get them back on. I believe our speakers are live. Please proceed.\nJim Clark: Apologies everyone.\nOperator: Okay. Aaron, you can continue.\nAaron Spychalla: Appreciate the commentary on the move to fresh foods in that industry and initial progress on the cross-selling. Can you just talk about how big that opportunity could be for you, as we look out a couple of years? And then just separately on the 7,500 site awarded, I saw mention of that being 3.5 years instead of 4.5 years before. Can you just kind of talk about shortening refresh cycles there and if that project has started yet and just maybe some more details there?\nJim Clark: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for joining. Thanks for the call, and apologies to everyone on the line for the technical issue. We see the opportunity in terms of the expansion in cross-selling, particularly in grocery, C-store environment and a few others, quick-serve retail, with the combination of our graphics, lighting, display and refrigerated display solutions, as being very big. I mean, I don't know how to quantify it or qualify it bigger than that, but we are talking about markets that are annually in the billions of dollars. By every measure, we're still on aggregate a small player. Not that there's necessarily a larger player than us with the aggregated solution that we offer, it's just that the market opportunity is very big. I don't know how to quantify it over that, except to say again that it's in the billions of dollars. In terms of the cycle time, in the projects we've won, there are two projects. I'll just take a second to mention them specifically. There is the 1,300 location project, which is a refresh and that is scheduled and we have a firm commitment on a three year span. There is a second project which is over 7,000 locations and the goal is to get it done in 3.5 years, but factoring in some of the material challenges and some of the customer zone challenges and realistically kind of trying to set a goalpost for that. We think it's going to be in excess of, it will likely be 700 to 1000 sites a year. And so it puts us in excess of five to seven years to get that done, but as we're in the project, I think we'll have more updates maybe annually or in a couple of quarters, we'll get a better feel for the customer's ability to move forward. We think we can easily double the current number within our existing footprint and within our existing system. But again, it requires the cooperation of the customer and the sites to be available and all those type of things. So, it's good news. I think that we'll find out more in terms of the timing as we move forward.\nAaron Spychalla: And then just on grocery, your commentary on an increase slight in the third quarter, but accelerating into 4Q in 2025. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of this is coming from the new R-290 offering versus just overall activity starting to recover? And then just maybe thoughts on how big the two large customers are as a part of this recovery?\nJim Clark: Yes. So number one, let me just talk on the headwinds we're facing, the temporary slowdown in the grocery vertical, if you will. It doesn’t -- it isn't specifically related to one or two customers. It's really broad across the market that we serve. And I believe the reason being that should this FTC related review and etcetera continue to drag on. The uncertainty about who, from a competitor standpoint, who are you competing against. Are you competing against one of the newly merged stores? Are you competing against your known competitor? Are you possibly buying a location that they're exiting? Are you competing against a location where they will exit completely? So, I think the impact or we believe the impact is much broader than just one or two customers. It's across a segment as the entire segment looks to see who will my competition be and how will I have to compete against them and where will I have to invest to compete against this new entity or the momentum that they're likely to drive in this sector. So, right now for us the delays are strictly regulatory related and the progress on that is we just don't have a crystal ball to see where that ends up happening. With that said though, whether things move forward or whether things move forward or whether they don't, we believe that, there is pent-up demand and there is pent-up opportunity.  We have -- we are hopeful that regardless of the progress on this that things will continue to shake loose in the third quarter here, which we are already in, but certainly into the fourth quarter. Any of the timing on those things could be disrupted. In terms of R-290 versus our traditional solutions, right now everything is based on the traditional solution. Any changeover to R-290 are conversations that are going on now, and we anticipate that we have shipped these products, there is high interest in them, but we expect that the adoption rate certainly could take the better part of the year.  I think most of our customers will look to experiment with the product, make sure that it performs to the expectations that where marketing it will perform to, we are very confident it will. But I think that in a solid process, they will take and they will slowly put this out into the field and see how it performs, provide feedback and then continue to move forward to that. So I wouldn't suspect that over the next year, this year, this calendar year 2024, in any of our calls, we are going to be talking about a big momentum shift. But, we will be supplying more and more of that product as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright.\nAmit Dayal: With respect to this C-store investments and upgrades you are anticipating, Jim, do we have the products and offerings in place already to meet this type of demand or is that something you will be working on? Any insight on what kind of investments will be required to meet this potential cycle of upgrades?\nJim Clark: Absolutely, Amit. Thank you for joining. Thanks for the question. We certainly have the capacity, the skill and the experience to do it. As we talked about on other calls, this is our normal kind of course of business. We typically get involved. We are putting anywhere from 9 to 18 to 24 months of pre-planning of test systems back and forth, changes to what the actual products are going to be delivered and what they are going to look like.  When a contract award is given, it's not uncommon for us to be looking at anywhere from 18 to 36 to 60 months or longer project depending on the number of sites. We feel very confident that, we have not only these two opportunities and they will fit very well into our current production schedule, but that we also have additional capabilities and plans to scale up, as we move forward.  So within our current infrastructure, we have the plans -- we have the capacity to handle this plus more to provide in our normal customers or another opportunity and we have the plans, which are not excessively capital-intensive to scale up beyond that. The only change that we have made to accommodate for these two large projects is, we are in a facility right now that allows us some expansion and we took on another, what was it, 12,000, 15,000 square feet, Jim?\nJim Galeese: Yes.\nJim Clark: 15,000 square feet. Just to give us a little bit more running room, but we could have done it within the space that we had.\nAmit Dayal: And are you already seeing some of this in your other segments like QSRs, etcetera? I mean, it looks like you are benefiting from these types of investments by your customers already, right? Or maybe you will in the future?\nJim Clark: Yes, we are absolutely benefiting from the changes that are going on in the market, these competitive forces. As we have talked about often, we believe the sectors we are in, grocery being a very strong sector, the C-store sector. I talked about it a little bit in my comments earlier about a great Wall Street Journal article published last month. December 16th, it's called Gas with a Side of Pizza. It just talks about that in-store transaction and how well we're set up to deliver on those requirements. And it spans across the entire offering that we have: lighting, graphics, standalone displays, refrigerated displays, digital graphics, these are all key elements to that expansion and one that are really driving margin improvement for our customers not just in the petroleum space but in the grocery space, in the QSR space. So, although grocery is temporarily disrupted right now, we still feel all of our original thesis is sound and it's not going to be -- it's a temporary pause. It's not anything structural to this market. And we believe it could really be a boom to going forward. And I want to underline, we have the capacity to be able to respond to it and we have the plans to be able to respond with additional capabilities if we need to.\nAmit Dayal: Just one last question for me. The quality of earnings improvement on that front, is this here to stay or do you expect some variance from these levels going forward depending on how the marketing sales and other overhead needs develop to you as you scale your businesses?\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean you folks have been following us for a while. A lot of the people on this call have been following us for a while. We have plans to continue to get incremental improvements out of the business. I would define it as saying we still have a lot of runway left in front of us. We've talked about this on prior calls that there is still just environmentally out of our control, but general environmentally opportunities, supply chain is -- we've always been able to manage the supply chain very well, and we've had a lot of advantages that we have been able to extract from that and will continue to. But as that continues to improve outside of our control, that's going to benefit us. Stable labor and workforce that has continued to benefit us. Customer projects that have been on hold or deferred, those will continue to benefit us. We think, we have a lot of runway left for continued improvement on the margins. And like I said in last quarter's call, remember, our EBITDA was 12.2% for the quarter and we do have some efficiencies that we're able to gain through our peak seasons versus our slower seasons. Q2 and Q3 are slower seasons. It's seasonally affected cold weather, weather in general, that type of thing. Construction slows down, remodels slow down. So our efficiency and our ability to manage margin is a little bit more impacted. But you can see that, even in our slower quarters here, Q2, Q3, we are into Q3 now, but Q2, we are still able to extract those opportunities and extract improvements. I think there is still a lot of runway left in front of us.\nJim Galeese: Amit, Jim Galeese here. Just to build on what Jim said, what gives us confidence is, the improvement is not being driven by one certain item, but there is multiple factors contributing both from a commercial lever as well as the operational lever. Commercially, starting with where we play and then our ability to effectively price manage our projects.  And then secondly, operationally sourcing from supply chain, Jim mentioned with material input costs, the impact of new products, design savings, labor productivity. So we track all of those very closely and there is a lot of greens. It gives us confidence that, our improvements, which now have been improving quarter-on-quarter for quite some time, we are confident in our ability to sustain that and build on that because of the multiple levers contributing to the improvement.\nOperator: Our next question is from Leanne Hayden with Canaccord Genuity.\nLeanne Hayden: Hi, everyone. This is Leanne Hayden on for George Gianarikas. Just a couple of questions from me. Can you just discuss any bottlenecks you might see in the supply chain, for example, permitting or equipment like transformers or any potential bottlenecks you might be seeing?\nJim Clark: Yes. Leanne, thanks for calling and tell George we missed them. I will say that, supply chain has become very predictable for us now or much more predictable, I should say. Issues like permits and other suppliers are still variable and still exist out there. I'm sure there is nobody on this call that doesn't follow the industrial markets that understand the challenges around switchgear and things like that.  None of those canceled projects, so to speak. They just disrupt the timing of them. And I think where we are right now is, we are just comfortably in that uncomfortable spot. Although those disruptions still occur, I would say, they are much more stable and they are more reflective of the pace of the business we have now. So I don't want to say that, there isn't any impact from them and I don't want to say that, somebody couldn't give us a surprise. But I would like to say that, within that environment, we are very comfortable now. It's just a protracted in a longer environment. But it doesn't result in massive disruption to project schedules, as it had in the past and it doesn't disrupt the customer's commitment moving forward.\nLeanne Hayden: And then I believe this was touched on briefly in transcript, but could you share or update us on your thoughts around M&A and how the target pipeline is looking at? Have your accretion parameters changed at all? Any updates in that realm would be great.\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean it's frustrating to me that I can't disclose everything that we are engaged in or talking about or that we came close to or any of that type of thing. But I would categorize it as this. We are very actively involved. We have looked at a number of projects. We want to make sure they are good fits, from a business perspective obviously and a cultural perspective which we highly value here and anything we are looking at in terms of an acquisition. We are in a very good position financially as you noted. As you've all probably noted, our leverage ratio now is 0.4. We're in a very good position there. We have very good financial partners.  And we have discussed and we have plans, if we needed to do something that required beyond our current access. So, all of those things are lining up. In general, I feel the market is more active right now in terms of potential opportunities. I think that a lot of the pricing, the expectations from sellers is better normalized, if you will. But the competition is still very fierce. Financial buyers are still out there. They are still willing to accelerate the multiples paid and things like that. So, we find ourselves in a very competitive a process, but we find that we're engaged in more opportunities now.  So, net on net, I would say we are very encouraged and I am very hopeful that we will be able to advance something certainly within the next year, if not sooner.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rick Fearon with Accretive Capital Partners.\nRick Fearon: Hi, Jim and Jim, and congrats on another solid quarter. Yes, just a really impressive uptick in your gross margin and I know improvement in that scale doesn't come easily. So, just interested in hearing what some of the levers may have been to achieve this increase, especially on the Lighting side? \nJim Clark: Yes. I mean, I think that some of the things, well, first of all, Rick, thanks for joining. Thanks for the question. I think some of the things we've talked about in the past are still the levers we're able to pull. And if I were to kind of try to paint a picture, those levers that we're pulling, we've pulled them a quarter of the way, two-thirds of the way. We still have room in them. But chiefly, it's manufacturing efficiency improvements and ongoing improvements in our manufacturing efficiency. Supply chain, we've got a very good team relative to supply chain. It's not just about pricing, it's about being good partners to our suppliers that supply us, being predictable. Giving them the forecast that we stay on and they have been reliable suppliers. When you do that, you are no longer expediting things. You are not pulling the lever for contingencies. You are not disrupting your manufacturing process that is expensive. So, I want to say there's simple, well grounded, basic kind of levers of running a good business, and our team is just good at doing that. We think that we still have levers to pull and room within the levers we're pulling. \nRick Fearon: And as I know you're well aware, LSI's longstanding customer, Burger King just announced the acquisition of their largest franchisee, Carrols Restaurant Group. And in the announcement, they also talked about remodeling over 1,000 franchise stores over the next five years. And so, can't help but think there's some opportunity there. I was just interested in your perspective on this as well as really any other QSR activity that might be on the horizon? \nJim Clark: Yes, I don't have, I'm aware of that transaction and congratulations to them. I'm sure that given the pace at which they're making changes within their system, they will benefit from it and we will benefit from it. I will say that, it's a great partnership. We really respect the way they run their business and the plans they have in mind and their execution matches up very well with ours. And that's why I think we have become such strong partners with them.  And I will say, it’s the exact same thing that attracts a number of the potential customers or a number of newer customers we are dealing with. That very high say do ratio, right? We are not super flashy, although I think some of our solutions are. We’re not -- we don't over commit. We sit down and have realistic conversations with them and other partners in that space, and I think we have gotten real value out of that.  The customers have gotten real value out of that, because they know what to expect. We deliver and we say we are going to do. And it fits very well within that structure of that environment because it's very hard to come in and make those changes without potentially disrupting their normal flow of business and we have earned the reputation of being able to do that. And I think that our customer is responding very well to it. So I'm very excited what we will see, what will happen there. I would suspect that, we are right there in that planning process.\nRick Fearon: Yes. It really speaks volumes to have a customer like Burger King and such strong customers like Burger King on the QSR side. And so, you guys are obviously doing things right to keep them happy. Yes, my only other question really, sort of follow-up on one of the other questions relates to your strong balance sheet. You have once again reproduced with the methodical debt reduction, great work on that front.  And so, yes, here we are with have some, I'm sure, exciting opportunities that are coming across the desk. And just wondered if you could provide any color on valuations. Like, it sounds like, it is more of a buyer's market than it has been, but curious if that's consistent with what you are seeing. \nJim Clark: Yes, I mean, I'm not sure I'm willing to jump on. It's completely a buyer's market, but it has changed, right? So it has changed a bit. I still think there is great respect for the businesses that are currently for sale and they want to get maximum value whether they are financially-owned or independently individually or corporate-owned or whatever it is. So the pricing is obviously pricing and valuations still remain a key element.  I would say, overall in perspective, inflation has hit the valuations also. But we feel very encouraged that, the conversations are much more meaningful now. They are much more balanced. It's kind of the best analog I can give it. It's kind of like the real estate market. A couple of years back, properties that were up for sale, agents were saying, submit your best and final no home inspection. All bids are due by 3 PM, that type of thing.  And much like that in the M&A environment, we feel that, the conversations are much more meaningful. They are much more future oriented. They are proud of the accomplishments they have had, where the business is, or they are aware of where the business is. But they are much more willing to talk about put future opportunities in wide and support their valuations and that's what we enjoy in those conversations.  And as you know, most of the people on this call know, we also highly value cultural fit right? There are businesses we would like to be involved in, but we sit down and we realize -- we're just not a good fit. We see things differently. We value things differently. And although the business might fit well in our plan, if we have to go in and change course of that business, we know that the value is just not there for us. So, it's a funny shaped little door. We continue to be very disciplined in what we look at, and but we are excited and we do think that there's opportunity on the horizon for us.\nRick Fearon: That discipline on the culture side I'm sure saves a lot of headaches. So, you proved yourself at JSI and wonderful acquisition and look forward to hearing more about the next to come. But thanks for the perspective and all your nice work.\nJim Clark: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jim Clark for concluding remarks. \nJim Clark: I don't think there's any question. If you heard our comments, you read our press release, we're certainly facing some headwinds, but I think that we have done an exceptional job of demonstrating our ability to challenge that those headwinds and be ready and be prepared for what the future is going to hold. Our expectation is regardless of what happens with some of the current FTC reviews and things that are out with some of our customers, there's a good opportunity, a great opportunity in front of us either direction. We also believe that we have a lot of runway left in just our core businesses, our platform, our investment thesis. We covered a lot on today's call. Margin performance, we still believe we have room to manage that and room to grow, and even with these headwinds we're able to demonstrate that. Q2 and Q3 historically are slower quarters, and you combine a couple of these challenges and you see it looks disproportional, but it's not. We don't see anything that is systemic or causes concern for any type of long-term trends or anything.  And I'd just like to leave everybody on the call saying that we're excited about what we see in the future. We're excited about the movement forward in the market, we're excited about potential on the M&A front. We're excited about other opportunities we have in terms of the way we manage and run our business. So, we come off of this quarter, excited for the next and the ones after that and we appreciate the time you all take to spend a few minutes with us and learn a little bit more about the company. With that, I will say thank you and goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jim Galeese, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, Mr. Galeese, you may begin.\nJim Galeese: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. We issued a press release before the market opened this morning, detailing our fiscal '24 first quarter results. In addition to this release, we also posted a conference call presentation in the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site. Information contained in this presentation will be referenced throughout today's conference call, included are certain non-GAAP measures for improved transparency of our operating results. A complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is contained in our press release and 10-Q. Please note that management's commentary and responses to today's questions on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements about our business outlook. Such statements involve risks and opportunities and actual results could differ materially. I refer you to our safe harbor statement, which appears in this morning's press release as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. Today's call will begin with remarks summarizing our fiscal first quarter results. At the conclusion of these prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to LSI President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Clark.\nJim Clark: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, all, and thank you for joining us today. As you have likely noted from our press release, we had solid results in our first quarter of fiscal year 2024. We continue to improve business operations in nearly every category and the commitment of our team and their ability to execute continues to be demonstrated each day. Adjusted net income for the quarter was up 23%. Adjusted EBITDA came in at 12.2%. We had an EPS of $0.29, which was up $0.04 from last year, and free cash flow was better than $9 million for the quarter, bringing our net debt to $25 million, while sales remained steady. As you may recall from my last call, I spoke about our Fast Forward plan at LSI. This plan outlines our business goals and objectives extending out the fiscal year 2028, and it is regularly shared with our entire management team and company personnel. It is also posted on our Web site under our Investor Relations section. The plan has some ambitious goals in top line sales, margin performance, profitability, and the markets that we intend to serve. With any goal or acquired skill, you plan and practice your craft to advance to the point where you're proficient in the execution and confident in your ability to repeat and control emotions and activities that advance you towards your goal. In some cases, progress is swift. And in others, it will require repeated effort in fine-tuning in order to advance. I'm sure that all of you have experienced a journey like this before. Anyone in the history tried to develop a new skill, a habit or advance towards some goal understands it's the speed in which you progress can vary and external factors are always at play. Along those lines, I wanted to remind everyone that our goal is to be an $800 million company with 12.5% adjusted EBITDA performance or better in 2028. The reason I point this out, this quarter, we achieved 12.2% in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. This accomplishment helps demonstrate to the team at LSI that this level of performance is well within our REIT. And if we continue to focus and practice, we can sustain that level of performance and reach even further in the future. Now with that said, I want to remind you all that much like our path to 10% EBITDA, there will be ups and downs in our journey to 12.5% or better. Some quarters will be better than others, but we will learn from each. I do not expect that we will regularly perform at this elevated 12%-plus level just quite yet, but I do know that we can get there, and I think this quarter shows it. As I look out short-term, we know that Q2 and Q3 are typically seasonally affected and lower utilization puts pressure on our margin. Last year, we had the best Q2 performance in the company's history. In fact, it was our single best quarter ever. And as I mentioned in the past, we do not expect that every Q2 will be like that. In fact, I expect that we will have some settling and realignment this year. As I mentioned over the last four or five quarters, our quote activity remains at very high level, but our quote-to-conversion time has been extended, and it continues to be less predictable than it has in the past. Permitting issues have stabilized, but they're still unpredictable. Supply from other trades, particularly electrical switch gear, remains unsteady and this slows project time. Our Automotive vertical, which interestingly enough has had a very strong demand for the last few years is a bit less predictable right now, which I'm sure is connected to the Big 3's labor negotiation. Our Grocery segment has a lot of potential and program interest, but is also a bit constrained right now due to a probable merger and divestitures and a seasonal pause that occurs as the holidays approach. As I look forward to the next few quarters, we have some challenges, but we also have some exciting and meaningful opportunities in front of us. We have a number of new products, new commercial efforts, a number of focused marketing programs and continued progress in our operational efforts. Last week, we were awarded the second phase of lighting in our ongoing involvement in the new EV power plant, battery manufacturing facility in Kentucky. This award was even larger than the first award, and it goes to underlying customer confidence in our product quality and our ability to deliver. In addition, we also noted last week that we have been awarded a large 7,000 site multiyear brand refresh program for a major oil retailer. This is all good news, and it speaks well for continued opportunities in front of us. From an operational perspective, just yesterday, I was in our new Bangor, Maine facility. This is a location that will be responsible for the production of our new zero ozone-depleting R-290 refrigerated solution. I'm happy to say that things are progressing well. And as we stand right now, we will begin production in this facility and delivery in Q3. Customer interest in this product is high, and our team is excited to have this offering in our arsenal of solution. I also had the chance to visit our Milo, Maine [indiscernible] facility. We've been putting time into reforming this factory, and I had the opportunity to see the results of our ongoing changes to our manufacturing process, which helps us to optimize production and reduce waste, improve margins, all while adding additional capacity and capability. Two weeks ago, I was in our Burlington, North Carolina facility. This location is responsible for our stock and flow lighting business, Atlas Lighting. We're in the middle of what we call lighting season within this business, typically, this is the time of the year we see an increase in maintenance and repair of outdoor lighting in preparation for shorter days and longer nights as winter sets in across the U.S. This is an area where Atlas tends to shine. There's a lot of potential opportunity here and are very confident in this team's ability to deliver and are looking forward to seeing the results of this coming quarter. Lastly, I want to make note that we have recently completed a number of changes to our print graphics division, Akron, Ohio, whereas over the summer, we consolidated print operations into our Houston, Texas plant, which we expect will yield a number of costs and operational efficiencies, along with increased capability. Our ADAPT project management group and our digital menu board program management team remains in Akron. All in all, we expect a strong year in 2024, but we are aware of a number of external factors that could affect timing and progress. Our Automotive vertical, our Grocery vertical and our work in warehousing could all be affected over the next few quarters as mergers, labor tax progress, and the holiday seasons effect project time. We do not see any of these disruptions as structural risk, and we are confident that any impact would be limited to timing only. Our team is committed and innovative, and we expect to continue our journey to $800 million in 2028. I want to thank you all again for turning into the call. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jim Galeese for a deeper look at our financial.\nJim Galeese: Thank you, Jim. For the quarter, LSI generated increased earnings and earnings per share, margin rate expansion, strong cash flow, and working capital efficiency. An increased gross margin rate contributed significantly to our improved earnings and margin expansion with the rate improving for both the Lighting and Display Solutions segment. Several factors contributed to the 260 basis point improvement, led by improved program pricing and moderating material input and operating costs. We exhibited strong commercial and operational execution in the quarter. Commercially, our team continued to work closely with partners and customers to exploit opportunities in key vertical markets, while operationally, we effectively manage the timing fluctuation of several programs. Our supply chain capabilities continue to be an effective force for our business. Strong cash flow of over $9 million served to reduce net debt to $25 million and lowered our TTM ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt to 0.5x. This provides the balance sheet flexibility to support our capital allocation priorities, which include debt reduction, investment in organic growth initiatives, inorganic growth opportunities, and return of capital. Now comments on segment performance, for Lighting, Q1 sales obtained strong prior year levels as our vertical markets continue to generate favorable activity and reassess our share position growing. For Lighting, adjusted gross margin rate increased 110 basis points to 34.9%. Pricing, project mix, and favorable material input costs all contributing. It was a strong quarter for outdoor project activity, led by high-value area lighting and parking garage applications. Operating expenses increased somewhat versus prior year, driven by planned investments and commercial growth initiatives. Q1 project quote levels for Lighting were 4% above prior year, despite fluctuating on a daily and weekly basis as opposed to conversion period remains lengthened. Project pricing across most verticals remain stable. Looking forward, we expect Lighting activity to remain steady in the near-term with Q2 sales at or several points above prior year levels. Moving to Display Solutions, adjusted operating income increased considerably on modestly lower sales. Operating income increased 19%, with the gross margin rate increasing a substantial 360 basis points. Sales growth was realized across multiple customers in the refueling C-store and QSR vertical. Sales in Grocery slowed in the quarter as the pending merger of the nation's top two grocery chains is causing timing disruptions on certain programs. The significant improvement in gross margin rate reflects our ongoing focus and effectiveness on program pricing and high-value mix. It was an eventful quarter for new activity highlighted by the program award from one of the nation's largest oil company, to deliver a brand refresh for 7,000 domestic locations covering seven brand banners, all to be completed in 4.5 years, a challenging task. Our proven solutions and trusted long-term relationship with this customer positioned LSI as the partner of choice. We were also awarded programs by several oil companies for brand conversions in six Central American countries and Jamaica. It's pertinent to note the Archer and Forward Throw technologies referenced in our press release will be prominently applied in both programs, an example of innovative solutions to customer problem. We talk about the lumpiness and volatility of program activity and the 7,000 site program is a good example. This program has been in the gestation period for 14 months, beginning with our involvement in the concept phase to final award. While this program is very large, the cycle from our initial involvement to award on these custom programs can range from several months to well over a year. We have early concept involvement with many display solution customers, and the program proposal activity continues to advance in major verticals, including Refueling & C-Store, Grocery, and QSR. Currently, in Grocery, we have several customers deferring major brand and image expenditures until there is clarity on the pending merger, the outcome and potential disposition involving hundreds of stores. While the broader outlook for our Display Solutions business is strong, the near-term will be impacted by grocery industry events. Entering the second quarter, we will continue to be diligent, again, focusing on commercial and operational execution, margin management, and cash. I'll now turn the call back to the moderator for the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Aaron Spychalla with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.\nAaron Spychalla: Yes. Good morning, Jim and Jim. Thanks for all the color and for taking the questions. First for me, you talked about -- on the refueling opportunity can you just share a little bit more on the cadence of the rollout there? Is that pretty even or how might that look? And then you referenced on several new significant programs secured during the quarter. Any other details to share there based on size, end market timing, et cetera?\nJim Clark: Good morning, Aaron. And thanks for the call -- thanks for the question and thanks for participating in the call. Yes, the refueling opportunity, I think, really goes to underlying something we've been talking about for some time, which is -- remember, we're trusted with the branding, with the identity of these locations. And if we went back just five years ago, we were talking about a 7- to 10-year refresh cycle. And we have been talking for some time about how we're seeing that refresh cycle compress. And we're now solidly into the five trending kind of 3% to 5%. And this particular customer, 7,000 locations, they just -- we just completed a refresh program with them not long ago. It helps underline that we're right at that five-year mark, where they look and they say, \"Hey, five years is long enough.\" So we just finished one -- this one that we are -- that we were just recently awarded is right now scheduled to be 4.5 years in length. And it'd really be under their direction with us as a partner. But I think they're very purposeful about how the timing of it. They're going to take the sites that were just completed. Those sites will be on the tail end of this 4.5 years, and the sites that are 4.5 to five years old will be the first ones to update. So, we're very happy about that. It's a great program. It was a hard-fought win and one will fit right up our alley. The second project we mentioned was the second phase of the EV power plant. There's a lot going on right now in the automotive industry, as you know. But this -- we received the order early last week, and we're very excited about that. It just goes to continue to underline our ability to serve very large projects to be local, to be domestic here. We're not looking at a foreign source supply chain or anything like that. We're able to be a real partner on these projects, accommodate changes that may happen. Even things that may cause the customer to change their entire initial thought with our ability to manufacture here domestically, we're able to really react to those types of things. I think it just goes to underline that a lot of customers are recognizing that value and we're able to capitalize on it.\nAaron Spychalla: Great. Thanks for the color on that. And then, just second, the execution on the margins has been really impressive. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about some of the initiatives there you mentioned making the business more flexible based on this kind of demand timing, so any details there? And you kind of touched on it at the beginning, but just how might margins kind of progress this year just as we're thinking about the kind of FY '28 goals as well?\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean, I think the thing on margins is that we've been pretty consistent in underlining that we think we have opportunities to continue to improve margins just incrementally quarter-after-quarter, and we don't see a shortage of runway for us to do that. It's really about efficiency. And it covers everything. All the way, it starts with the initial order process, setting customer expectations relative to delivery, working closer with the customers. It goes right into our supply chain and procurement and supply chain management. It follows right through in manufacturing and all the way out the door and even the shipping partners we're choosing. So, every one of those levers as an opportunity to be pulled, it's really getting in a rhythm where we're pulling them all at the right time and that our customer -- that our suppliers and all our partners that are part of that are executing on their commitments. I've talked already about there's still a lot of lumpiness just kind of globally and domestically in supply chain. There's unevenness where one supplier is rock solid. The other one still has a lot of ups and downs. Those are what we call -- what we refer to as kind of unnatural inefficiencies that exist in the supply chain right now. We are not going to bend over backwards trying to fix those. We will let the natural course of things fix themselves, but we will do things to mitigate that, buying additional inventory, having multiple suppliers, that type of thing. And that causes extra work and inefficiency. So, when those things continue to stabilize and get back to the level or get to the level we want them to be at, there'll be even more opportunity for margin improvement. So, it's really kind of a mix of a lot of ingredients that create that margin efficiency. But we're looking to pull all those levers consistently. And there are headwinds the way we look at them, and we're prepared to fight against those headwinds. And when they turn into tailwinds, we'll benefit even more.\nAaron Spychalla: Understood. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\nAmit Dayal: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Jim, on the Display side, revenues were lower year-over-year, but margins improved quite a bit. So, going forward, sort of ex-grocery, is that helping margins potentially continuing to remain elevated while revenues for the Display segment may slow down a little bit?\nJim Clark: No, I wouldn't characterize it as that. I mean, I think that the margin improvement you're seeing is through management and team initiatives, we would much rather have those sales that are just kind of deferred right now, if you will, in Grocery. We would rather have those in there. And I think that if we had those in there, you would even see a greater improvement. Remember, for us, probably the thing that causes the most drag is our fixed cost and fixed investments and utilization is key for us. So, the more we're able to utilize all those resources we have, the more efficient we can be. So, I think what you're seeing there or I know what you're seeing there is really the work of a broad team to make sure we're executing well.\nAmit Dayal: Understood. Thank you for that.\nJim Galeese: And Amit, Jim Galeese here. It really starts also with our value proposition itself. It's a key part of our vertical market strategy, obviously, and the level of innovation, the things we've done in the last few years, and we referenced those things like the REDiMount, the Archer and the Forward Throw and so forth, that value is recognized by the customers. So, it's part of our pricing program and the fact that that's recognized allows us then to get the appropriate price. Jim mentioned we have an effective product cost. So, all in all, positions us well for margin generation. And with the appropriate volume, yes, we feel we can absolutely sustain and grow our margin expansion and our margin development.\nAmit Dayal: Understood. And just comments around the grocery side of things impacted by ongoing M&A activity, maybe some seasonality. Do you anticipate this to continue sort of maybe impacting the performance from that vertical for the next one or two quarters? Or is that something that is potentially coming to a close sooner and then you may be able to resume sort of normal activity with those types of customers?\nJim Clark: Yes. I would say that we don't have a crystal ball on this, and I don't think there's a playbook. There really hasn't been kind of a merger of this scale in decades, if it's ever occurred at all. We do have -- the customers that are affected and involved in this or doing their best to communicate timing and what their thoughts are, but it's a very dynamic and fluid situation, everything from regulatory approvals to final disposal list and changes and all those types of things. What I will say, that is unable to be controlled. The program side of it, what they intend to do when all these hurdles are accomplished or achieved, I think, is pretty robust, and they know where they're going. They've talked about different formats and different changes, and we're very aware of what those programs are going to look like. o I would categorize it just as timing-related issues with potentially a very big upside here. But trying to guess the timing is just beyond our scope. We -- I feel like we get good solid credible information and they're treating us well in terms of the information they share with us. But I think there's an aspect they don't know either. And so, we're all going through this together.\nAmit Dayal: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. And this last one from me. Any cost increases from the new production facilities coming on, maybe you mentioned the ozone solution, the new ozone solution facility coming online shortly. How should we think about any costs, et cetera, from those types of activities in the future quarters?\nJim Clark: The short answer is very minimal impact and from a cost standpoint. And just so I can touch on it a little bit broader. This is our R-29 free ozone-depleting -- negative ozone-depleting, no ozone depletion refrigerant. So, we're moving from a man-made chemical to a natural refrigerant and it doesn't have any negative ozone impact.\nJim Galeese: No emissions.\nJim Clark: No emissions. What we did with that is we already had a facility that was supporting our primary refrigeration facility. We exited that and moved into this newer facility. And because it was kind of a ground-up effort for us, we were able to reengineer our manufacturing line. We improved -- we believe we will get a pretty good improvement in terms of efficiency, which will be recognized as margin improvement and that type of thing. But we also got a pretty solid bump in capacity, too.And that's going to be important, particularly if things play out the way we think they're going to play out, we will need that capacity. So, short answer to your question is cost impact should be minimal, but some real benefits hitting under here, not just in terms of a new category or product for us, but in terms of our ability to manufacture total unit volume and that type of thing. And that extends across both our traditional platform and our new R-290 platform.\nAmit Dayal: Understood. That's all I have, guys. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to understand a little bit about some of the volatility you're describing in end markets. I mean, you talked about Grocery and that seems fairly idiosyncratic and related to the mergers there. Also, I think you mentioned auto. You have a pretty diversified business. So, could you please just sort of describe what you're seeing in broad strokes from the various end markets that you participate in? Thank you.\nJim Clark: Yes, good morning George, and thanks for the question. I mean, listen, I think in general, I mean, if you look at the performance in the last quarter, Lighting had a strong quarter and kind of resisted a lot of kind of market trends, if you will, for Lighting. I think that we continue to execute well. We've got a product line and a strategy that is continuing to be rewarded. And we don't -- we're able to kind of pivot more quickly in terms of customers that are impacted by some of these macro events and things a little bit easier for us. On the Display Solutions side, these are typically very project-oriented.\nJim Galeese: Large.\nJim Clark: A large project in anything that pauses them for any length of time has a disruption. It's not really about any type of concentration. No one customer makes up more than 10%, the numbers actually likely far below that. It's just that the things that when one thing pauses and it's a program pause, it's not a cancellation or anything, but it's just kicks the things down the road and we've talked a lot about timing over the last year, maybe year and a half. What we initially started talking about was things like permitting and things like that, we still see a lot of project timing disruptions because of order trades. I mentioned electrical switch gear earlier, those type of things. We don't see them as anything that's going to be disruptive in a long-term, but we see them as things could be disruptive in a quarter or in a month or things like that, and we're feeling that. I think that it's -- what I said in my comments earlier, I think it's really limited to grocery right now for obvious reasons. And it extends beyond just the two that are involved, it extends kind of through the industry to see what do we need to compete against? Who's going to be our competitor in a certain segment? Is there an opportunity here? Does a competitor need to refresh their brand? So, there's a lot of kind of extra thinking, if you will, going on in that segment. Automotive is probably pretty easy to understand. I think that even if you're not -- even if you're with one of the competitors, the disruption in terms of supply chain and just having units available and what the used car market is going to do and how this is going to be impacted. And right now, there is tentative agreements across how quickly will production resume, how about suppliers in that supply chain that maybe are affected. I think a lot of that is just causing a pause, you start to see a couple of these segments being paused. And they account for 2, 3, 5, whatever percent top line pressure that we have. And so, I think we're just trying to make everybody aware, we don't see anything that is a significant threat in terms of overall and long-term, but we do see some timing disruptions right now that we're just trying to comment on.\nGeorge Gianarikas: I appreciate the transparency. And you have been talking about this for a little while as you referenced. And so, to the extent that there are timing issues, some of them are related to maybe macroeconomics, some of them are related to M&A, some of them are related to permitting and supply chain issues. And it feels like -- is it right that they constitute or -- in each one of those buckets separately?\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean, I think that it's -- like I was saying in kind of a cookie mix, right, there's a lot of ingredients that go into it. And some of them are being impacted right now, so the recipe doesn't look quite the same, but I would also say that not giving any forward-looking statements. But I would also say that if you think there's still a little bit, there could be a huge opportunity on the back of this timing disruption. One that I underline, we'll ready for and we think we can absorb and help our customer when they are -- when they do get to that point. I would also say that a majority of our business still remains very stable. And I mentioned in my comments earlier, the quote activity. I mean, listen, I keep looking based on macroeconomic things and just impacts to the economy, looking at the ABI and AIA statistics and all of that. We say, \"Okay, maybe some of this is going to slow down, and it's not.\" It's just not slowing down that quote activity still remains very high. That would be something that we would might consider kind of a leading indicator, and it's not turning on us. But what we are seeing is that quote-to-order conversion time, it just continues to be lumpy and it's lumpy on the longer end. But we're also aware that, that could change like that. And we have had some customers inquire and say, \"How quickly?\" And so we're ready on both sides is what I would say.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Thanks. And maybe as a final question, you guys have done an admirable job bringing down the debt, paying off maturities. Now you're at a very reasonable level of leverage. You continue to generate strong free cash flow. How do you -- how should we think about the M&A opportunity as you discussed in the past and the instrument through which you'd make that happen? I mean, if you're seeing any sort of macroeconomic impact, I'm sure others are as well? And so any broad characterization of what's going on in the M&A market would be appreciated? Thank you.\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean, I will break that up into two pieces. First, we are very committed to doing something from as much as we're going to grow organically, which will likely be the larger part of our own total growth story was equally as committed on the M&A side. And I would sum it up and say we're in a really good position, I think, not just from a debt standpoint but we are right now in our current leverage in cash flow, but also our partners, both our financial partners and our broader M&A partners. And then lastly, I would say the activity level and the willingness to have conversations that are more grounded and realistic have been -- have exponentially improved. It's not just been a small tick. It's been a big tick. And I will say that I enjoy this environment much more. I think the conversations are more grounded. I think that the companies and the opportunities we've been looking at have been much more -- much more well thought out. And the management teams on the other side are much better prepared in the meetings. And we're able to construct and look at opportunities with a lot more data and a lot more kind of forward look than in the past. So, I would just say we're very committed to it, and we're going to continue to look for that right opportunity. And I'll also underline, as we've said before, we're very disciplined. It's got to work for us and for the other company and as a whole. And we're excited, though, I would say that.\nGeorge Gianarikas: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Rick Fearon with Accretive Capital Partners. Please go ahead.\nRichard Fearon: Good morning, Jim and Jim, and congratulations on another very solid quarter. Particularly those program wins, the 7,000 petroleum units and 1,400 unit entry into Central America, Jamaica. It really speaks to the durability of LSI's model and a lot of the initiatives that you set in place a few years ago, Jim. So, great to see tangible results, and I have to believe that, that new business should help smooth some of the cycles that you've talked about today in the same way that having multiple industry verticals probably does. But anyhow you've kind of given a lot of good color on that. I just -- my main question revolves around the M&A. And while the new product development is really impressive and impactful, I have to believe the de-levered balance sheet has really opened up some exciting opportunities for acquisitions. And this is where you have a unique skill set. You kind of proved yourself capable of assimilating another business with JSI really successfully. So, it sounds like the M&A funnel now is open and you're reviewing some interesting things. And I just wondered if there's any personnel adjustments or engagements with investment bankers or anything of the sort that you think could be used for that you may be considering at this point, or do you feel like you're in a good spot in terms of your reviewing process?\nJim Clark: Rick, good morning, and thank you for the question. Listen, here's what I would say is our ears are always open. There's plenty of partnership opportunities out there, and we're always listening to the folks that we work with today and others from a banking standpoint and that type of thing. I think the current environment, none of us have really had to face these kind of headwinds in decades. So, the financial partners that are aware of that can react to the current environment and have a perspective on what the future looks like in the past or are our most valuable partners. In terms of personnel in the company, we have been training for this since day 1. Everybody that's here are truly hands-on people. There are no -- there's kind of no ivory tower positions here. Everybody has a skill set and they can be called to action at any time and the -- not only are they available and capable, they're willing. And we -- I think we've got a diverse group of people here that would really help with any type of integration and value extraction and our ability to kind of get feet on the ground and immediately start working on the value we see in any type of M&A work. And then lastly, taking all of this backwards, as I just mentioned with George's comments or question, the environment just feels richer to us right now. I like the folks that are able to talk about how they've grown, but how they see their future and how we could work together. And it's not just here you go, add on to this. It's here you go, and here's how I think we can accelerate each other's business. And I really value that in the folks that we meet with. And then lastly, I would say, and I think you're aware of it and everyone on the call, this vertical strategy allows us to really kind of cast a wide net relative to the things we're looking at. It's focused. Don't get me wrong. It's focused and it's got a good point to it, but it's not so narrow that we're just looking at a lighting company or we're just looking at a display solution company. I mean, I think that JSI was a great example where it caught some folks, they didn't see -- they didn't see it immediately, but I think they see it now. And we've had a number of conversations like that also. So, I'm excited. It never moves as quickly as you wanted to and it has to be right for us and right for the other company and we need that value out of it. It could be next quarter or it could be next year.\nRichard Fearon: Thanks for the additional color, Jim. And regarding the JSI and the great fit that's kind of evolved there, you see new R-290 capabilities that the company has helping to open up some new doors, especially as you look to penetrate the C-Store vertical with those displays?\nJim Clark: Yes, absolutely. The inquiry rate on the R-290 is very high. It's got to -- there's a lot of complexity behind it aside from the product itself and the benefits. There's field service capabilities and enough of the HVAC industry being trained with natural gases and things like that. So, there is a great excitement, but there are also challenges. I'd put it -- this is not a great analogy, but it's one I think that people can understand, it's just like electric cars, right? Maybe some people feel the underlying proposal is solid, but the infrastructure is not there, all the charging stations, all the things you need to really make it take off, including the generation of just power. But same thing in the R-290, I think the value proposition is well understood, our ability to manufacture it and everything, but there are other components that need to make sure we're keeping pace with it or that is keeping pace with our ability to deliver. And all of those are always part of the conversation. So, I would say the interest is very high, and we expect that this is a product that will have legs for many years to come.\nRichard Fearon: That's exciting. And the last comment/question, evolves this sort of involves the grocery vertical that you spent a lot of time talking about today, and you may mention of this, but it just seems that the massive merger here that's been disruptive at the moment. It has the potential of creating some massive refresh programs. And I guess, do you think that's a fair way of thinking about the possible outcome of this grocery merger?\nJim Clark: I do. I do. I mean, wholeheartedly, I do. I mean, you got to think -- we look at kind of three pieces, if you were to break it down. One, it's clear that there's going to be a disposition of somewhere between 400 and 600 locations that are no longer going to be part of those primary banners. So, those 400 to 600 locations unquestionably will need a brand image refresh. That goes without saying. Then the merger itself, we don't have all the details on this, but that will create -- that's going to create an immediate opportunity just for the work that has been sidelined for a while right now. I mean, you can imagine you don't want to do a lot of capital spend and be moving things around. I think they're doing a very good job of keeping their business going and serving their customers and stuff, but these longer program initiatives without knowing what the final result is going to look like, I don't think people are rushing to do a lot of work in that arena. So, the way we look at it is the quote could literally come out of the barrel on the back side of this thing and we'll be ready to support them in whatever direction they want -- they decide to go. And we do look at it and say there could be a very sizable upside on the back end of this. Not just normal course of business -- not just normal course of business stuff, either, but it just to fit in with whatever this new look is going to be or whatever this new brand or image is going to be.\nRichard Fearon: Well, it does sound very predictable and very tangible. So, that's pretty exciting to think about. And so, the quote activity remains high. And apart from this delay, it sounds like things continue to move in the right direction. And I just wanted to thank you and Jim and your team for the hard work.\nJim Clark: Yes. Thank you. It is a whole team here. I try to make sure we always comment on it, but there's 1,600 people here who make it all happen every day, and they're just as excited about what the future holds as we are. So, -- \nRichard Fearon: Thanks again.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor over to Jim Clark for closing comments.\nJim Clark: I think we had a pretty complete conversation here. I think that between our results here in Q1, which we felt were very strong in the conversation that we had and the questions that we had about future outlook kind of encapsulate everything. The way we're seeing it, we're on our path to our 2028 goal. I was very excited that we were able to get EBITDA results up above 12%. It goes to demonstrate and show to our team that this is well within our reach. As I mentioned, I don't expect it to stay at that elevated level. But just being able to reach near that bell shows that we have the capability of doing that. We think that we have some really good forward-looking opportunities. And although the timing may be a little disrupted, we are really confident that it's going to serve us well. The 7,000 location site we talked about, which will be a four to 4.5-year project, really goes to underlying things that we've talked about over the last year to two years about how there's a compression in the whole updating, upgrading of image and brand across so much of our customer base, so a pretty exciting quarter. We're looking forward to the next quarter, and we're looking forward to a good year in 2024, and I appreciate everyone's interest. And with that, we'll say a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
