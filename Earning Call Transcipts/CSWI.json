A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Alexa Huerta. Thank you, Ms. Huerta. You may begin.\nAlexa Huerta: Thank you, Kat. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CSW Industrials Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today is Joseph Armes, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of CSW Industrials; and James Perry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release, updated Investor Relations presentation and Form 10-Q prior to the markets opening today, all of which are available on the Investors portion of our website at www.cswindustrials.com. This call is being webcast and information on accessing the replay is included in the earnings release. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed today in our earnings release, in our comments made during this call as well as the risk factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Armes: Thank you, Alexa. Good morning, everyone. Impressively, our team continues to outperform the markets we serve despite challenging conditions and again, delivered record results in the third quarter and year-to-date against strong prior year results. The third quarter results demonstrate our continued ability to grow through the cycle and drive notable operating leverage in our bottom line results. Earlier this morning, we announced record third quarter revenue of $175 million, record third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.07, and record third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $37 million. EPS and EBITDA were both adjusted to exclude certain nonrecurring tax items related to past acquisitions, as we indicated they would be, on our last earnings call. Adjusted EBITDA grew 18% on 2% growth in revenue, delivering 270 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion up to 21% in the third quarter. On the heels of two consecutive quarters of record results, we continued generating record Q3 and year-to-date results in revenue of $582 million or 3.5% growth, an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.97, or 11.4% growth and an adjusted EBITDA of $144 million, a robust 15.7% growth. For the third consecutive quarter, we delivered outstanding cash flow from operations with a record fiscal third quarter total of $47 million. This led to a paydown of $20 million of borrowing under our revolving credit facility in the third quarter and an aggregate reduction of $100 million during the fiscal year. We continue to reduce our interest expense and fortify our balance sheet to provide significant flexibility to pursue future opportunities as they arise. Over the last few quarters, we have seen ocean freight return to normal levels. We have reduced our domestic freight costs and driven additional operational efficiencies versus the prior year. Recently, we have been monitoring issues in the Red Sea. We have been working closely with our freight forwarders to assess the impact on pricing and transit time for all in-transit and potential future shipments. We are assessing the most efficient delivery routes and options, but there could be some temporary upward pressure on shipping rates. We also continue to see increased compensation expense as we staff up for our continued growth and retain the highest caliber team members. By successfully implementing new and maintaining prior pricing initiatives and increasing our gross margins through freight expense savings, CSWI has been able to achieve meaningful operating leverage and expand further our already healthy margins. We have always and will continue to prioritize capital investments based on the estimated risk-adjusted returns with the ultimate goal of increasing long-term shareholder value. We evaluate organic and inorganic opportunities for growth that support our generous margins and we continuously maintain a pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities. I'm proud of the execution within each of the three business segments, so I would like to briefly speak about the performance of each segment. Then James will provide additional financial details around the quarter. The third quarter is seasonally our slowest quarter of the year for our Contractor Solutions segment, but our team did an excellent job by not only delivering another quarter of market outperformance, but also year-over-year growth despite the HVAC/R industry experiencing a decline in residential volumes. Contractor Solutions delivered Q3 net revenue of $115.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year period. Our competitive advantage in this segment centers around our distribution channel, introducing innovative high value products and focusing on acquisition integration. The power of our distribution model allows CSWI to acquire, integrate, master distribute, and accelerate growth on newly designed products. This results in faster and more profitable sales because our strong relationships with wholesalers, our sales network, logistics leverage, credit and back-office support, allowing us to focus on serving our customers well. Our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment revenue decreased $2.6 million in the quarter driven primarily by a temporary shipment delay at the end of the quarter, which we expect to recover in full during this fiscal year. The temporary shipment delay was offset partially by pricing initiatives. The SRS team continues to make improvements in operational efficiency and quality. Strong oil and gas drilling and mining end markets showed growth, but we saw a bit of softening in industrial end markets. Despite passenger rail being down in the third quarter, the outlook remains good and the team continues to introduce new innovative products. Revenue in our Engineered Building Solutions segment was up with an increase of 13% in the quarter due to the conversion of bookings into revenue benefiting from our record backlog as well as positive pricing initiatives. For the eighth consecutive quarter, this segment's backlog reached an all-time high with our aluminum railings business continuing to drive most of the growth. We continue to see strong growth from multifamily housing in the Canadian market. Project mix and our record backlog continues to skew toward larger jobs which may take two years or more to turn into revenue. Our sales and estimation teams continue to focus our bidding and booking on institutional and multifamily projects with the highest quality developers to ensure the greatest likelihood of closing. And I'm proud of the performance of the EBS team. Before I turn the call over to James, I'd like to take a moment to brag on our team for delivering growth through pricing initiatives and even volumes during a period when some of our end markets are declining. The vigor of our business model includes the diversification of our product portfolio, the resilience of the end markets we serve, and the repeatable consumption of many of our products that are used either in maintenance, repair and replacement applications or to enhance the reliability, performance and lifespan of mission-critical assets. The products we sell in Contractor Solutions and Specialized Reliability Solutions, and the value they provide are often nondiscretionary. Fundamental necessities for both homeowners, businesses and the utility sector. We have outperformed the markets we serve all year long while expanding margins, strengthening our balance sheet and reducing our leverage ratio. CSWI is positioned to overcome market headwinds and pursue growth opportunities that arise across our entire portfolio. At this time, I'll turn the call over to James for a closer look at our results and then I will conclude our prepared remarks.\nJames Perry: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. During the fiscal year-to-date period, we delivered record year-to-date revenue of $582 million, representing growth of 3.5%. Most of the growth has come organically, but $7.5 million came from the acquisitions of Cover Guard, AC Guard and Falcon in fiscal 2023. Operating leverage on this revenue drove nearly 16% growth in adjusted EBITDA and over 11% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share. Our consolidated revenue during the fiscal third quarter of 2024 was $175 million, a 2.3% increase as compared to the prior year period. This growth was driven organically through pricing initiatives and increased unit volumes. Consolidated gross profit in the fiscal third quarter was $74 million, representing more than 12% growth over the prior year period. Gross profit margin improved to 42% compared to 38.5% in the prior year period, driven by revenue growth from pricing actions, increased unit volumes, and lower ocean and domestic freight costs. As mentioned on our last earnings call, as a reminder, we are presenting the fiscal third quarter's profitability figures on an adjusted basis due to the $8.5 million or $0.48 per share release of tax indemnification assets related to TRUaire and Falcon acquisitions and the related uncertain tax position accrual for Falcon. This amount is in the Contractor Solutions segment and consolidated results as other expense. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased by $6 million to $37 million or 18% growth when compared to the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21% as compared to 18% in the prior year quarter, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion partially offset by incremental employee expenses and increased travel to drive revenue growth. We continue to strive for additional EBITDA leverage as we grow revenue and prudently manage expenses. Net income attributable to CSWI in the fiscal third quarter was $17 million as adjusted or $1.07 per diluted share compared to $16 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior year period, representing growth of 6%. Our Contractor Solutions segment with $115 million in revenue accounted for 66% of our consolidated revenue and delivered $3.5 million or 3% total growth as compared to the prior year quarter. All growth in the quarter was organic, came from all end markets and was a result of pricing actions and increased unit volumes. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $33 million or 29% of revenue compared to $28 million or 25% of revenue in the prior year period as our margin growth continues. The increasing margins resulted from the company's ability to maintain and even increase some pricing while leveraging the lower year-over-year freight costs. Our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment revenue decreased 7% to $34 million, primarily due to a temporary delay in shipments at quarter end. We expect to fully recover this missed revenue in our current fiscal fourth quarter. We were able to leverage the segment EBITDA and EBITDA margin of $5.2 million and 15% respectively in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, compared to $5.1 million and 14% in the prior year period of managing expenses and driving operating efficiencies. Our SRS team remains focused on top and bottom line growth as well as offering the right mix of high-value products to our customer base around the world. Our Engineered Building Solutions segment revenue increased to $28 million, a 13% increase as compared to $25 million in the prior year period. Bidding and booking trends remained solid. In fact, we ended December with our eighth consecutive quarter of record backlog in this segment. At the end of the fiscal third quarter, our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing eight quarters was about 1.2:1. Segment EBITDA grew 49% to $4 million, or 14% EBITDA margin in the third quarter compared to $2.7 million and an 11% EBITDA margin in the prior year period. Transitioning to the continuous strengthening of our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our fiscal 2024 third quarter with $25 million of cash and reported record fiscal third quarter cash flow from operations of $47 million compared to $37 million in the same quarter last year. For the current year-to-date period in fiscal 2024, the company had a record cash flow from operations of $142 million, or 69% growth compared to $84 million in the first three quarters of the prior fiscal year. Our free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, grew 31% to $43 million in the fiscal third quarter as compared to $33 million in the same period a year ago. That resulted in free cash flow per share of $2.76 in the fiscal third quarter as compared to $2.13 in the same period a year ago. This impressive level of free cash flow fuels our capital allocation strategy and ultimately enhances shareholder value. As Joe mentioned, as part of our broad capital allocation strategy, during the quarter we paid down $20 million of our outstanding debt. We ended the fiscal third quarter with $153 million outstanding on our $500 million revolver. Our bank covenant leverage ratio at quarter end was 0.69 times, an improvement from 1.3 times at the end of fiscal 2023 due to our strong EBITDA growth and the $100 million paydown of our revolver in that time frame. As a reminder, at the end of the fiscal 2024 second quarter, our bank coverage leverage ratio was 0.85 as the company has been in the lowest tier of our revolver pricing since reporting our fiscal 2024 first quarter, reducing our interest rate spread and creating interest expense savings. We continue to maintain strong liquidity in a tough financial environment. To remind everyone once more, in February of 2023, we entered into an interest rate hedge for the first $100 million of borrowings under our revolver. During the fiscal third quarter and the first three quarters of the year, the interest rate hedge saved us approximately $400,000 and $1.1 million, respectively in interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal third quarter was 43.2% on a GAAP basis and 32.5% as adjusted. The higher-than-normal 32.5% effective adjusted tax rate was driven by the finalization of the international tax deduction and credits for the fiscal 2023 US federal tax return and the effect of seasonality of revenue on our fiscal third quarter. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 27% and 28% for fiscal 2024. As we look out to the rest of fiscal 2024, we anticipate delivering full year record revenue growth with continued meaningful operating leverage. We also expect the current full fiscal year to close with record adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as well as record cash flow. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe for closing remarks.\nJoseph Armes: Thank you, James. To summarize, during the third fiscal quarter of 2024, we continued to deliver on our commitments by posting record results across the board, highlighted by organic revenue growth, expanded margins and robust cash flow. While there has been uncertainty in certain key end markets all year long, we still expect to outperform versus the end markets we serve. We will focus on leveraging our strong distributor relationships and delivering earnings growth through expense optimization. We will continue to demonstrate capital discipline, drive cash flow conversion, and deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value. Because how we succeed matters, CSWI will continue to focus on our most important asset, which is our people. I would like to share one safety metric that is extremely important to our management team. That is our TRIR, the Total Reportable Incident Rate. The final TRIR for the entire enterprise for calendar year 2023 was 0.9, down significantly compared to 1.9 for the calendar year 2022. Our continued commitment to keeping our team members safe on a daily basis has reduced our TRIR by over 50% for the calendar year. I want to thank everyone at CSWI for contributing to our continued success and achieving this meaningful milestone for the company and all of our employees. Continuing with our theme of people, you may have seen in a separate news release this morning that we announced the appointment of Jeff Underwood to Senior Vice President of CSWI and General Manager of the Contractor Solutions segment. Jeff will succeed Don Sullivan in his current role as the Head of Contractor Solutions. Don will remain with CSWI as an Executive Vice President and assume the new role at Corporate of Chief Strategy Officer and ensure a smooth transition of leadership. Very happy to welcome Jeff to the executive leadership team and especially pleased that Don and I will continue to work closely together. As we approach the end of a record fiscal 2024, we expect a solid fourth quarter, and we're off to a good start with what appears to have been a strong January for our businesses. We are now preparing our budget for fiscal 2025, and while there's still much work to be done as we finalize the budget, we recognize there are variables that can change throughout the year. We do expect to show revenue growth and to maintain or expand our operating margins. We also expect to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities that would supplement our organic growth. We believe that the future is very bright. While we do have temporary headwinds from time to time, the fundamental investment thesis for our business remains firmly intact. We remain focused on the long-term growth of the company while delivering year-over-year growth in revenue and profits. In our largest end market, HVAC/R, we offer innovative, high-value products that our customers prefer, and we remain focused on the products and subcategories that are growing faster than the overall industry. We continue to experience rising temperatures, higher homeowner expectations for comfort, and a growing installed base, driven in part by a housing shortage. We believe these dynamics provide a backdrop where we can deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Now, as always, I want to close by thanking all of my colleagues here at CSWI, who collectively own approximately 5% of CSWI through our stock -- our employee stock ownership plan, as well as our shareholders for their continued interest in and support of our company. With that operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jon Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Please proceed.\nJon Tanwanteng: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions and really nice job on the margins, especially given that missed shipment. I was wondering if you could tell us what was actually delayed and what was the actual impact on the quarter. Number one. And number two, if you've already seen that ship out in January, or if that's still in the common, and when you expect to make that up.\nJoseph Armes: Hey, Jon. It's Joe. It wasn't one shipment. It was a series of shipments. Just missed opportunity at the end of the quarter. There were some packaging shortages. There were some staffing shortages and things that did that. Yes, we are already seeing that flow through in January. And as James and I both mentioned, that should be fully realized in the final quarter here. So the back half of the year, the full year, is still completely intact.\nJon Tanwanteng: Got it. Okay. And was it in just the SRS segment or was that in multiple segments?\nJoseph Armes: No, only in SRS.\nJon Tanwanteng: Got it. Okay. Could you also quantify the strength you're seeing in January? Is that because of the shipment pushouts or is that on an organic basis excluding that effect?\nJoseph Armes: I would say excluding that effect.\nJon Tanwanteng: Okay. Got it. And then you mentioned shipping costs going up even despite all the freight improvements you made in the last year. I was wondering, one, how much do you ship through the Red Sea today, if that much at all? And how much do you expect to see inflation in that shipping and freight for you guys this year?\nJames Perry: Yeah. Jon, good morning, it's James. Thanks for being on as always. Yeah, we do have some shipments from our Vietnam facility that will travel through the Suez Canal normally. Those shipments have all been rerouted so they're all going south around the south tip of Africa as most shipments are. We have other shipments that go in different directions, of course, but those have been rerouted. You have seen an increase in pricing. As you know, pricing was down a couple thousand dollars a few years ago, we got up to $20,000 plus back to a couple of thousand. We're seeing rates out there, call it $4,000 or so. You've seen things pop. We expect that this is rather temporary for now. We'll see. It's only been a few weeks. But number one, our cargo is safe. It's being rerouted. Things take a little longer to get here. This is also the time that we've spent the last couple of weeks as a lot of manufacturers have been stocking up because you have the Tet holiday when all production shuts down for 10 or 12 days in Asia, us being no exception. That starts, I think on Saturday in fact. So we kind of get ahead of that. So we've had some shipments come through. So you really have a couple of weeks here where things -- you won't see that impact in that respect. There was a lot of media in the last couple of days around this seems to be somewhat temporary. It's not fully baked into supply and demand. So we'll see. I'll remind you, however, that when we do put something on a boat and as you know, we ship a few dozen containers over every week from our facility, it takes several months for that to flow through our cost of goods sold. So you're still seeing this last quarter, Q3, the current quarter Q4, still working off of a lower freight rate. So we're still experiencing that year-over-year delta in the pickup. This fourth quarter, last year this time rates had come down, so that delta is starting to minimize. So you'll see this temporary pop more in the first part of next year. We're monitoring it closely, working hard on efficient rates, alternative routes, and those kind of things with our shipping partners, but still feel good where we are. But that's one of the elements, as Joe talked about as we go through our budget, how that will impact things. And most importantly, we want to be sure we preserve margins so we'll take the actions we need to do to be sure that we stay intact from our expectations.\nJon Tanwanteng: Got it. That was kind of a follow-up. What do you expect to do on pricing, I guess to reflect these rates? Is it going to be like a surcharge? Is it just part of your normal pricing increases as you go through the year? And does that also incorporate the increased retention compensation that you were talking about earlier?\nJames Perry: Yeah, that's dynamic. We've already put through our normal annual seasonal price increases. We announced those a few weeks ago, and those go into effect here pretty soon. And so that's normal. And we achieved the normal kind of back-to-normal prior to hyperinflation pricing increases that we would normally see. Do we need to adjust things to account for shipping rates? We'll see. If this becomes a permanently higher rate, then our team is certainly ready to look at that and what the market will bear and what's appropriate. We always, like I said, maintain our margins. Do a good job with that. I think we assume labor costs are going to be up. That's already baked into our expectations, those kind of things. But the dynamic around shipping rates, how long that lasts, and what the impact really looks like it will be, will determine if we need to take action going forward.\nJon Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in queue. Appreciate it.\nJames Perry: Thank you, Jon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julio Romero from Sidoti & Company. Please proceed.\nJulio Romero: Thank you, and good morning, Joe, James and Alexa. Maybe to start on Contractor Solutions. Nice job. Once again, growing unit volumes there. I wanted to ask what the first month of calendar ‘24 has kind of told you about how the remainder of the calendar year will shape up in regards to HVAC/R demand, what you're hearing from customers, and what your boots on the ground are seeing.\nJames Perry: Sure, Julio. This is James. Good morning. Thanks for being on the call, as always. Yeah, we wanted to give you a little peak into January to give you a sense of what Q4 looks like. It's just one month. We're literally starting to close the books today. But across the board, we felt really good about January. And as Joe mentioned earlier to Jon, that's not just on the heels of making up for the lost shipments in SRS in December. Right now we feel good. We're at the very beginning of the early buying season for Contractor Solutions. That HVAC market will start really stocking up the next couple of months. A lot of us were at the industry show just last week. A lot of people reported it was record attendance. A lot of mixed conversations when you talk to folks. But we continue to outperform the market. We are indexed to the subcategories, as Joe mentioned, that grow faster than the unitary ducted HVAC OEM market. There's some expectations that could be down this year, some relatively flat. But like we said, we expect growth. The ductless market continues to grow as a percent of share and the number of products, as you and our shareholders know that we have tied to that ductless market continues to grow. Areas like search protection continue to grow and we're indexed to that space more and more as we go along. So our commercial team continues to find products to introduce and innovate that will outperform the market. So it's hard to say that January, the strength that we've seen, is a precursor to an entirely great season. But we will certainly take a good January. One thing I will say without getting too deep into it. We'll report back in May when we have a good sense of how the start of the year looked out. We can never predict the weather, but we talked a lot the last couple of quarters about destocking. And we've said that generally it feels like that's behind us. And I think the fact that we saw in Contractor Solutions and nice January tells us that folks are stocking up for what they anticipate to be a good season.\nJulio Romero: Thanks very much. That's really helpful color there. And you talked about your efforts to outperform the market on the HVAC side. Some of that's related to your efforts to increase sales of some previously acquired product lines, taking them nationwide. Can you just speak to that and maybe how much more runway you have with that?\nJames Perry: I still think there's runway. It's a great question. We -- you go back to even TRUaire over three years ago now. We're still introducing that product to some new customers because we want to be really sure that when we introduce a product and they're going to displace a competitor, that we're going to give them the highest level of customer service, the highest availability of inventory, the pricing, that makes sense for us and them. So we're still converting customers from TRUaire and Shoemaker from three years and two years ago, respectively. One example I'll give you, though, of a recent one is Falcon. That's now organic because Falcon is more than a year old. So we call that organic. That was a West Coast centered product for the most part under marketed, under commercialized, because of -- the ownership team did a great job innovating and selling the product, but they were somewhat limited. And it's a great example of our model of shipping that out to more distributors. That was a slow introduction. We got the product in our catalog immediately and moved the inventory over. It was literally a couple of hundred-mile move. But we now have introduced that nationwide. Now it's in all of our warehouses. Now the customers are more aware of the product. So our ability to now kind of own the water heater, so to speak, and have a full package of things around the water heater that the Falcon connectors attach to is now a full product. We had a whole part of our booth at the show last week, in fact, around the water heater, and Falcon is prominent. So it takes time. So there is certainly runway for those acquisitions we made about 18 months ago, as well as still runway for TRUaire and Shoemaker. So, yeah, I appreciate you recognizing that. You don't get all that day one, you don't get it all quarter one or year one. It is a long cycle of introduction and continued opportunity for growth.\nJulio Romero: Very helpful there. And then just wanted to ask about the other press release you had this morning regarding the appointments. Can you maybe talk a little bit about Jeff's background and what he brings to the role of GM of Contractor Solutions? And same question about Don and what he brings to the Strategy Officer role.\nJoseph Armes: Yeah. This is Joe. I'll start with Jeff. I mean, Jeff's been here for five years now, charge of sales and marketing. And when we talk about the professionalization of our go-to-market strategy for the Contractor Solutions segment, that's been Jeff's initiatives and the growth and really the increase in size and scale of that business has been in large part attributable to those initiatives and the great work that's been done there. So a real strong track record here. Jeff comes from -- came to us from Goodman, where he'd worked with Don before. Before that, Jeff had been at Bain. And just a really strong background, a lot of experience, well known in the marketplace, in the industry, has been very, very integral to our acquisition strategy for that business. And so a perfect kind of transition from Don to Jeff there, just the way you'd like to have it internal. Somebody who's been here had a lot of success internally, well known by our team and by our customers, and really expect just a completely seamless transition there on April 1, Don being a big part of that as well. It takes both of them to have a seamless transition. Don has been the most senior operating exec that we've had around here for a while and has just a tremendous track record of success. We have leaned on him to integrate these acquisitions and to make them successful, and he has done a phenomenal job with that. So just expanding the opportunity here for him to work across the segments. But really, I think Don's going to spend a lot of time looking for that next meaningful acquisition and hopefully having an opportunity to integrate another high-profile scale acquisition that will be really, really accretive for our shareholders.\nJulio Romero: Helpful. Well, congrats to Jeff and Don, and I'll pass it on.\nJoseph Armes: Thanks, Julio.\nJames Perry: Thanks, Julio.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Joseph Armes for closing comments.\nJoseph Armes: Great. Thank you everyone for joining us for this Q3 call. We appreciate your interest and look forward to speaking to you again in May. So, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexa Huerta, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nAlexa Huerta: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CSW Industrials Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today is Joseph Armes, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of CSW Industrials; and James Perry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release, updated Investor Relations presentation and Form 10-Q prior to the market's opening today, all of which are available on the Investors portion of our website at www.cswindustrials.com. This call is being webcast and information on accessing the replay is included in the earnings release. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed today in our earnings release in the comments made during this call as well as the risk factors identified in our annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Armes: Thank you, Alexa. Good morning, everyone. Our team continues to outperform the markets we serve and deliver impressive results against strong prior year period results. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to leverage our robust distributor relationships, drive operational execution, and prudently manage expenses. This morning, we announced record second quarter revenue of $204 million, record second quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.93 and record second quarter EBITDA of $53 million. We also continued to deliver outstanding operating leverage as EBITDA grew 21% on 7% growth in revenue with equally impressive EBITDA margin expansion of 300 basis points to 26%.We also announced record first half results and revenue of $407 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.90 and an EBITDA of $107 million. For the second quarter in a row, we delivered outstanding cash flow from operations with a record fiscal second quarter total of $45 million. This led to a paydown of $37 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the second quarter and an $80 million paydown for the first half of this fiscal year reducing our interest expense and providing us significant flexibility to pursue future opportunities as they arise. As we mentioned on our recent earnings calls, the cost of ocean freight has returned to more normal levels in the last few quarters. Since the beginning of fiscal 2024, we have also reduced our domestic freight expense and driven additional operational efficiencies versus the prior year. As we continue to staff for growth and retain our exceptional employees, we are experiencing increased compensation expenses. The amortization of intangible assets has also increased as a result of recent acquisitions. By successfully implementing a solid pricing strategy across all three segments and with our gross margin savings from freight expenses, we have been able to achieve operating leverage and further expand our margins. We continue to prioritize capital allocation decisions on a risk-adjusted returns basis with the ultimate goal of enhancing long-term shareholder value. We are often asked about our approach to M&A and our strategy has not shifted. We will continue to pursue both internal and external opportunities for growth that support our healthy margins and we will continue to maintain a pipeline of acquisition opportunities. I want to touch briefly on our segments, and then James will provide the additional details on our performance. Overall, I'm pleased with the execution of all three business segments. We are now approaching the slower season for our Contractor Solutions segment, but our team is highly focused on delivering another year of market outperformance despite the HVAC/R industry currently experiencing a decline in residential volumes. The strength of this segment centers around leveraging our robust distributor relationships, optimizing acquisition integration and delivering high value products to our customers. We are able to quickly acquire or master distribute products resulting in sales at a faster and more cost-effective rate due to our strong relationships with our suppliers, our network of sales representatives, logistics leverage and back office support. This allows us to do what we have always done with excellence, which is to focus on serving our customers well and being a great partner as we add new products to our portfolio. Our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment revenue was relatively flat in the quarter. The capacity utilization in our primary facility continued to improve over the prior year and our team there remains focused on top and bottom line growth. The SRS team has made notable improvements in operational efficiencies and quality, which give us confidence in our ability to reach our EBITDA margin goals for the full fiscal year. Industrial end markets are relatively stable, but we have seen some softening in energy, mining and rail. As an update on the Shell joint venture, we have elected to defer a portion of the planned capital expenditures as we assess the timing of production needs. We continue to work with Shell on forecasting their production requirements. On Engineered Building Solutions -- our Engineered Building Solutions segment was up with an increase in revenue of 13% in the quarter due to timing of project completions benefiting from our record backlog as well as positive pricing initiatives. For the 7th consecutive quarter, this segment's backlog reached an all-time high with Greco, our aluminum railings business, continuing to drive most of the growth. We continue to especially see strength in our Canadian market. Project mix and our record backlog skews more toward larger jobs, which can take more than 2 years to turn into revenue. But the vast majority of the backlog has, at a minimum, broken ground. We are still highly focused on pursuing institutional and multifamily projects undertaken by the highest quality developers, the highest likelihood of completion. Our EBS team continues to perform well. Before I turn the call over to James, I would like to remind everyone of the demonstrated resiliency of our business model. Strength of our business model include diversification of our product portfolio and of the end markets we serve, as well as the consumable nature of many of our products that are used either in maintenance, repair and replacement applications or to extend the reliability, performance and lifespan of mission-critical assets. Specific to our largest end markets, HVAC/R and plumbing, the products we sell and the value they provide are often nondiscretionary fundamental necessities for both homeowners and businesses. We continue to outperform in the categories we compete. We maintain a strong balance sheet that allows us to withstand market headwinds with ample liquidity that affords us the ability to pursue growth opportunities that arise across our entire portfolio of businesses. At this time, I'll turn the call over to James for a closer look at our results, and then I will conclude our prepared remarks.\nJames Perry: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. During the fiscal year-to-date period, we delivered a record first half revenue of $407 million, representing growth of 4.1%. Operating leverage on this growth drove 14.9% growth in EBITDA and 12.9% growth in earnings per diluted share. Our consolidated revenue during the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $204 million, a 6.5% increase as compared to the prior year period. This growth was driven by pricing actions, a slight increase in unit volumes due to the late summer heat wave in certain markets across the U.S. and inorganic revenue contribution from the Falcon acquisition last year. Consolidated gross profit in the fiscal second quarter was $91 million, representing 12.8% growth with the incremental profit resulting from revenue growth from pricing actions and lower inbound and outbound freight costs. Gross profit margin improved to 44.7% compared to 42.2% in the prior year period from revenue growth in the higher margin Contractor Solutions segment due to pricing initiatives combined with lower freight costs as compared to a year ago. Consolidated EBITDA increased by $9 million to $53 million or 21% growth when compared to the prior year period. Our EBITDA margin improved to 26% as compared to 23% in the prior year quarter, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by incremental employee expenses. This margin growth demonstrates the operating leverage we strive for as we focus on managing expenses while we grow revenue. Net income attributable to CSWI in the fiscal second quarter was $30 million or $1.93 per diluted share compared to $24 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the prior period, representing growth of 23%. The current quarter included increased amortization expense from intangible assets as a result of last fiscal year's acquisitions and Contractor Solutions. Our Contractor Solutions segment with $140 million of revenue accounted for 69% of our consolidated revenue and delivered $9.6 million or 7% total growth as compared to the prior year quarter. The $7.2 million or 6% of organic revenue growth was driven by the Plumbing and HVAC/R end markets and a result of pricing actions, with a slight increase in unit volume after the late summer heat wave experienced in certain portions of the U.S. Inorganic growth was $2.4 million in the quarter from the Falcon acquisition last fall. Segment EBITDA was $47 million or 33% of revenue compared to $39 million or 30% of revenue in the prior period as our margins continue to expand. The increasing margins result from the company's ability to maintain pricing and achieve operating efficiency opportunities, even as some, but not all, costs in the segment have come down over the prior year. Our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment revenue of $37 million was flat in the quarter due to the continued benefits from pricing initiatives, offset by softer energy, mining and rail markets. Segment EBITDA and EBITDA margin were $6.3 million and 17%, respectively, in the fiscal 2024 second quarter compared to $6.1 million and 16% in the prior year period. As Joe mentioned, our team in this segment remains focused on top and bottom line growth while driving operational efficiencies and offering the right mix of products to our expanding customer base around the world. Our Engineered Building Solutions segment revenue increased to $29 million, a 13% increase as compared to $26 million in the prior year period. Bidding and booking trends remain solid. In fact, we ended September with our seventh consecutive quarter of record backlog in this segment. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing 8 quarters was over 1.1 to 1. Our focus on profitability in this segment is visible as we delivered a record EBITDA of $5.7 million with a healthy 19.5% EBITDA margin in the second quarter. Transitioning to the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our fiscal 2024 second quarter with $14 million of cash and reported record cash flow from operations of $45 million compared to $30 million in the same quarter last year. For the first half of fiscal 2024, we had a record cash flow from operations of $95 million compared to $47 million in the first half of last year. Our free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $41.9 million in the fiscal second quarter as compared to $28 million in the same period a year ago. That resulted in free cash flow per share of $2.69 in the fiscal second quarter as compared to $1.81 in the same period a year ago. This impressive level of free cash flow fuels our risk-adjusted returns, capital allocation strategy, which, in turn, enhances shareholder value. As Joe mentioned, as part of our broad capital allocation strategy, during the quarter, we paid down $37 million of our outstanding debt. We ended the fiscal second quarter with $173 million outstanding on our $500 million revolver. Our bank covenant leverage ratio at quarter end was 0.85x, an improvement from 1.3x at the end of fiscal 2023 due to our strong EBITDA growth and the $80 million of paydown of our revolver. As a reminder, at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024, our bank coverage leverage ratio was 1.1x, which moved the company into the lowest tier of our revolver pricing grid, reducing our interest rate spread and creating interest expense savings. As a further reminder, in February of 2023, we entered into an interest rate hedge for the first $100 million of borrowings under our revolver. During the fiscal second quarter and the first half of the year, the interest rate hedge saved us approximately $400,000 and $700,000, respectively, in interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was 25.7% on a GAAP basis. We still expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for fiscal 2024 with the third quarter tax rate elevated due to normal Q3 tax activities. The tax rate in the third fiscal quarter will be adjusted for the $8.6 million noncash other expense partially offset by the related $1.1 million income tax benefit that will result from the tax indemnification assets related to the TRUaire and Falcon acquisitions that will expire as detailed in our 10-Q. We expect to report adjusted earnings in our fiscal third quarter due to these large nonrecurring items. The EPS adjustment in the fiscal third quarter for these items is expected to be approximately $0.48 at this time. As we look out to the rest of fiscal 2024, we anticipate revenue growth for the second half of the year, which, when coupled with meaningful operating leverage, we expect will result in strong year-over-year EBITDA and EPS growth as well as strong cash flow. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe for closing remarks.\nJoseph Armes: Thank you, James. To summarize, during the second fiscal quarter of 2024, we once again delivered record results, highlighted by both organic and inorganic revenue growth, expanded margins and robust cash flow. While there is uncertainty in certain key end markets, we still expect to outperform the markets we serve and to deliver consolidated revenue and earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 against strong prior year period results. We remain focused on leveraging our strong distributor relationships gaining efficiencies through operational excellence and prudently managing costs. We have and will continue to work to expand margins and to drive cash flow conversion. Consistent with our demonstrated track record, we will allocate capital according to our risk-adjusted returns discipline enabled by the strength of our balance sheet. This approach has led to consistent outstanding financial results and we do not intend to deviate from that strategy. Our stated goal is to be the partner of choice for our loyal customers, making it as easy as possible to do business with CSWI. In October, we were named HVAC Supplier of the Year by affiliated distributors, which is one of the largest customer organizations in our Contractor Solutions segment. This award is given to only one out of hundreds of suppliers based on direct feedback regarding availability of products, delivery times, ease of doing business, product innovation and other important metrics gathered from actual customers. This award is the latest in a series of such awards our team has received this year and demonstrates our commitment to serving our customers well. I'm extremely, extremely proud of the Contractor Solutions team for their continued success. As always, I want to close by thanking all my colleagues here at CSWI, who collectively own approximately 5% of CSWI through our employee stock ownership plan as well as all of our shareholders for your continued interest in and support of our company. With that, Rocco, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jonathan Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nPeter Lukas: Hi. Good morning. It's Pete Lukas for Jon. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of HVAC distributor destocking in the quarter if you've seen any? And do you think that inventories in the channel are rightsized at this point? Or is your sell-through in line with end demand?\nJames Perry: Good morning. It's James. I appreciate you being on the call. We obviously have a lot of customer conversations and contact. The destocking continue, probably some. The OEMs and the distributors have mentioned some of the same. I think it has certainly decelerated. We had our fiscal first quarter, the April, May, June quarter, with the slow start to the summer, they built up the inventory and worked through quite a bit of that with the really strong second quarter. And then obviously, as you end the second quarter kind of the September month, people start working down the seasonality and then ramping back up. And you see it in our inventory. Our inventory came down quite a bit from March to September as we kind of went through the summer season. Now we'll start ramping back up, getting ready for the busy selling season in the spring. So overall destocking, our sell-through, we feel very good about. We get good feedback on our sell-through rates. The fact that our volumes had a slight increase in the quarter, while most folks said that residential HVAC was still down low to mid single digits, it is a very positive sign in that respect and as Joe said, we continue to outperform the market.\nPeter Lukas: Very helpful. Thanks. And can you just discuss maybe some of the bigger moving parts you're seeing today in terms of input segment or end market and your ability to pass through those in terms of pricing?\nJames Perry: Sure. I think a lot of the costs have started to stabilize. We talked a lot a year ago, 2 years ago about ocean freight. Obviously, we ship a lot of containers over here from our Vietnam facility and other third-party outsourced suppliers we have. And those rates have come back down to good historical levels and have been relatively stable. They still bounce around some. The ocean freight carriers look to raise rates, but the demand has been a little bit soft. So we've been able to stabilize that and are pleased with where that's been. Similarly, trucking rates bounce around quite a bit with the cost of diesel here domestically. We ship things to our customers and between our own distribution centers. So that bounces around. It stabilized and looks for now. But with oil prices up, you watch that very carefully. Overall raw material costs have generally been pretty stable in the Contractor Solutions segment, I would say, things like steel, aluminum and resins. Within the Specialized Reliability Solutions segment, however, with oil prices up around $90 a barrel, obviously, base oil is a big component for a lot of the input costs there. So we have seen some increase in that space and, in fact, have raised prices recently to cover that and put through a price increase just in the last few weeks. Overall, though, our pricing has been stable. We've been able to hold on to our pricing. We will go through our normal annual look at pricing in the spring as we always do with our businesses, and that's expected, especially in the Contractor Solutions segment, but we have been able to maintain pricing. Overall, we've been able to see input costs stable, the one thing I'll mention, you heard us mention a couple of times, labor costs tend to be up a bit to attract and especially retain, as Joe said, our exceptional talent. There's a cost to that. As I'm sure you know, we've got pretty high compensation costs in terms of the benefits we provide with our ESOP plan. Every employee gets company stock each year that we pay for and [indiscernible] plan. Every employee is on an incentive plan. So we treat our employees very well. That's one of our key tenets of our culture. And so we have seen a rise a bit in employee cost, but to keep the talent we have to be able to meet the demand that's an investment [indiscernible].\nPeter Lukas: Perfect. Thank you. And then could you also just give us a little more color on the drivers of the higher sequential corporate expense?\nJames Perry: I think just overall, I think compensation expense is part of this, as I mentioned, as the company grows, you've got to cover that growth to some degree, the acquisitions we've done, the organic growth we've done, nothing unusual in the corporate line, I would say, just kind of general growth with the overall company growth [ph].\nPeter Lukas: Perfect. Thanks. And then just the last one for me. You talked about your M&A strategy being unchanged and still seeing a pipeline of opportunities, but looking to allocate on a risk-adjusted basis. Just wondering, are you seeing just more or less opportunities given the higher cost of capital and hurdle rate? Or just in general, what are you seeing out there?\nJoseph Armes: Yes, Pete, this is Joe. I don't know that we are seeing a lot different level of activity. Certainly, our hurdle rates have risen as a result of the higher cost of capital. We've always had a really high hurdle rate to begin with, right, from the standpoint of our margins. We really don't want to dilute our margins. We have a really high-value products that we offer to customers. And so our opportunity set, I think, continues to be robust, and we're pleased with that. And we tend to respond well in tougher markets because we've got a stronger balance sheet than others, allows us to move with speed and certainty and provide that to sellers. As you may recall, our largest and most successful acquisition to date, TRUaire, was done in the middle of the pandemic. And we did that on our balance sheet because we had the liquidity and the available capital to do that. And so -- so we are optimistic.\nPeter Lukas: Extremely helpful. Thanks for your time and I will jump back in the queue.\nJoseph Armes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJulio Romero: Great. Thanks. Hey, good morning, Joe, James, Alexa. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start on the Contractor Solutions segment. I was particularly impressed by the increase in the unit volumes there, and you called out that some of that might be attributable to a warm summer, maybe what's your best guess as to what the impact of that late summer heat wave was on the volume in the quarter? Or maybe thinking about it another way, how are unit volumes trending in the periods not affected by that heat wave?\nJames Perry: Yes. I think if you look at the last several quarters -- Julio, this is James. And again, appreciate you being on with us. Yes, in the last several quarters, we've talked about volumes being slightly down. We've never called out large decreases. The comps have been hard after a couple of really strong years 2021, even '22 were pretty strong and this fiscal year, so we are up against some tough comps. The comps have maybe gotten a little bit better. But overall, our team is doing a great job by picking up new customers, by picking up market share and wallet share. And again, when the OEMs and distributors talked about, they're still seeing residential down low single digits, and that's better than low mid teens or mid teens to high single digits. Overall, though, we feel good about that. And we talked about that in the last call. We were already a month into it and July was looking hot, August stayed hot, September stayed hot. So we certainly picked that up. As part of that, obviously, the [indiscernible] and we called that out specifically because it was a late start to the summer and when people are on their air conditioner 24 hours a day instead of 10 or 12 hours a day, that certainly creates more maintenance work, more repair work and even replacement, which is a positive tailwind for us. So we are pleased to have turned that from a slight negative to a slight positive. But I think as much as anything, it's our team out there selling more to new customers, a little bit of benefit from the acquisition, as we talked about. Falcon is the only one that's considered inorganic and that will turn organic again after this next quarter here in Q3. That will be organic. But overall, really pleased, and I want to highlight, too, the margin growth, to see the inflation we've had the last few years, to see even just slight unit volume growth, which we are very proud and pleased with that team to see margin growth like we've had of a few hundred basis points year-over-year is really impressive.\nJulio Romero: Okay. That's good color there. I appreciate that. And maybe talk to the timing of this HVAC residential volume normalization. How would you have us think about how that cadence kind of plays out over the next few quarters?\nJames Perry: Well, yes, we are entering, obviously, the slower quarter. As you all know, our fiscal third quarter here through December is the slower selling season because air conditioners aren't being run as much, obviously in most of the country, and then we'll start stocking up. And our fourth quarters, when we see things ramp back up, no one can fully predict what next year looks like economically. The interest rate environment has clearly put some pressure on some of that. But as we talked about earlier, from the question that Pete asked and as you've seen out in the market, everyone seems to think that destocking has decelerated and the destocking is generally kind of done by the end of this calendar year. And like I said, we are working the stock back up. We were just with our Contractor Solutions team, Joe, Alexa and I were in the last couple of weeks looking at their inventory and what we need to stock up to be sure we are ready for the busy selling season that really gets going in February, March again. So we are optimistic about next year. And we talked about second half growth overall for the company, and obviously, Contractor Solutions is a big engine to that. We are not forecasting anything for fiscal '25 yet, but I would certainly say that we are optimistic on our ability to continue to introduce innovative products, continue to win more market share, continue to penetrate and win more customers with more of our products. And then as Joe mentioned, also find acquisitions that can continue to fuel growth.\nJulio Romero: Got it. Really good color there. Maybe just turning to the Specialized Reliability Solutions segment. Maybe if you could talk about the end markets that you called out that we are seeing some softening. Maybe give us a flavor of the magnitude of the softening. And do you see demand for those markets kind of continuing to trend that way or maybe stabilizing anytime soon?\nJoseph Armes: Yes. Thanks, Julio. I think it's at the margin. We don't see large changes. Interestingly, the rig count domestically is down, while production rates are not down that much. The rig count is down. But international rig count is up, Canadian rig count is up. And so mix signals there. Mining and rail has been a little bit slower, and we are seeing some of that through the JV and so it's -- none of it's alarming. It's just at the margin, and we would expect normal variations throughout the year. There's a little bit of seasonality in some of those end markets, but nothing that's alarming at all.\nJulio Romero: What would you maybe attribute some of that softening? Is it just the general economic uncertainty, higher interest rates or anything of that nature?\nJoseph Armes: Yes, I think so. Yes, I mean a lot of uncertainty. It is -- people are not committing a lot of capital right now to larger projects due to higher interest rates and uncertainty of what the future holds. And so I think that's a little bit of slowdown to be expected.\nJulio Romero: Got it. And then maybe just last one for me on that segment. With the deferral of some of the CapEx you're doing, does that change the timing of when Phase 3 comes online?\nJoseph Armes: Well, it could. I think that our commitment to our shareholders all along has been to invest on a risk-adjusted returns basis. And so that presupposes that we are going to have demand for that capital investment. And so as we have said a couple of quarters now that the ramp up has been a little slower than anticipated, and so the capital is going to be a little slower than anticipated. We need to fully utilize the existing capacity before we add more. And we just think that's the prudent thing to do and good stewardship of our investors' capital.\nJulio Romero: Very good. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.\nJoseph Armes: Thanks, Julio.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for closing remarks.\nJoseph Armes: Great. Thank you, Rocco. We sure appreciate everyone joining us today and look forward to our next conversation next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexa Huerta, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nAlexa Huerta: Thank you, Andre. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the CSW Industrials fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. Joining me today is Joseph Armes, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of CSW Industrials, and James Perry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release, updated Investor Relations presentation and Form 10-Q prior to the market’s opening today, which are available on the Investor portion of our website at www.cswindustrial.com. This call is being webcast and information on accessing the replay is included in the earnings release. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed today in our earnings release and the comments made during this call as well as the risk factors identified in our annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Armes: Thank you, Alexa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal first quarter conference call. Once again, our team executed well in the face of headwinds in certain key markets. Our first quarter results reflect the tenacity, professionalism of our team members around the world. We are acutely focused on managing our costs, outperforming the categories we compete in and expanding our margins. For the quarter, we are announcing many record results with our record first quarter revenue of $203 million, a record first quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.97 per share and our record first quarter EBITDA of $54 million. We also delivered impressive operating leverage as EBITDA grew by 10% on 2% growth in revenue. But potentially, our most impressive metric is record cash flow from operations of $50 million for the first quarter. This led to a pay-down of $43 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the company ended the quarter with a balance of $210 million outstanding on our $500 million facility, allowing us to reduce our interest expense and maximize our potential to secure future opportunities as they arise. During the first fiscal quarter, last fall’s Cover Guard, AC Guard and Falcon acquisitions collectively contributed $5.1 million to inorganic revenue, all of which was reported in our Contractor Solutions segment. These product line extensions expanded our offerings into our high-margin HVAC/R and plumbing end markets, reflecting the accretive nature of our capital allocation strategy and our focus on complementary product categories within our existing end markets served. As we have mentioned on our recent earnings calls, the cost of shipping containers from Asia is down quite a bit since last year. And now we are seeing a reduction in domestic freight as well as a reduction in certain raw materials over the prior year. We are, however, still experiencing increased employee expenses as well as increased amortization of intangible assets due to recent acquisitions. By successfully maintaining our pricing across all 3 segments, we have further expanded our margins. In the first 3 months of fiscal year 2024, we deployed $7.9 million of capital via dividends and capital expenditures in addition to the revolver reduction that I already mentioned. We continue to pursue both internal and external opportunities for growth, consistent with our disciplined risk-adjusted return methodology and have maintained a healthy pipeline of acquisition opportunities. I want to touch briefly on our segments, then James will provide the additional details on our performance. Overall, I remain pleased with the execution of all three business segments and in particular, with our leadership team’s ability to adapt to dynamic conditions. We are in the middle of a busy summer season for our Contractor Solutions segment, and our team is highly focused on another year of growth despite the industry currently experiencing a decline in residential HVAC/R volumes. The strength of this segment centers around leveraging our powerful distribution network, optimizing acquisition integration and delivering high-value products to our customers. We are able to quickly acquire or master distribute products, resulting in sales at a faster and more cost-effective rate due to logistics leverage, supply agreements, our network of sales representatives, credit and back-office support. This allows us to do what we have always done well, which is to focus on serving our customers well as we add new products to our portfolio. Our specialized Reliability Solutions segment continues to exceed expectations. The capacity utilization in our primary facility continues to increase, and our team there remains focused on top and bottom line growth by driving operational efficiencies and offering the optimal mix of products to our customers around the globe. Energy market growth remains solid and industrial end markets are stable. Our joint venture with Shell continues to yield financial benefits, and we expect to complete the previously announced capacity expansion project within our existing facility by the end of this fiscal year, which will allow for increased revenue and profitability in fiscal 2025. Our Engineered Building Solutions segment was down slightly, the decrease in revenue of 3% in the quarter. However, for a sixth consecutive quarter, this segment’s backlog reached another all-time high with the aluminum railing business driving most of the growth. I will remind you that a significant portion of the current backlog is coming from larger jobs that typically do not turn into revenue for 18 months to 2 years. We are highly focused on pursuing institutional and multifamily projects undertaken by the highest quality developers with the highest likelihood of completion. And our team is performing well and delivering on current projects. Before I turn the call over to James, I would like to remind everyone of the demonstrated resiliency of our business model. Strength of our business model include the diversification of our product portfolio and of the end markets we serve as well as the consumable nature of many of our products that are used either in maintenance, repair and replacement applications or to extend the reliability, performance and life span of mission-critical assets. Specific to our largest end markets, HVAC/R and plumbing, the products we sell and the value they provide are often non-discretionary fundamental necessities for both homeowners and businesses. We continue to outperform the categories in which we compete. We have continued to maintain a strong balance sheet that allows us to withstand market headwinds with ample liquidity that affords us the ability to pursue growth opportunities that arise across our entire portfolio of businesses. At this time, I will turn the call over to James for a closer look at our results, and then I will conclude our prepared remarks.\nJames Perry: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Our consolidated revenue during fiscal first quarter 2024 was $203 million, a 2% increase as compared to the prior year period, driven by pricing actions and inorganic contributions from recent product acquisitions. Consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarter was $92 million, representing 7% growth with the incremental profit resulting from revenue growth and decreased costs from certain raw materials as well as lower inbound and outbound freight costs. Gross profit margin improved to 45.3% compared to 43.2% in the prior year period. From revenue growth in the higher-margin Contractor Solutions segment due to pricing initiatives and acquisitions as well as growth in the energy end market within specialized reliability solutions, combined with the lower freight costs as compared to a year ago and strong operational execution. Consolidated EBITDA increased by $5 million to $54 million or 10% growth when compared to the prior year period. Consolidated EBITDA margin improved to 27% as compared to 25% in the prior year quarter, above revenue growth that outpaced incremental expenses. This margin growth demonstrates the operating leverage that we strive for as we focus on managing expenses as we increase revenues. Net income attributable to CSWI in the fiscal first quarter was $31 million or $1.97 per diluted share compared to $29 million or $1.88 per diluted share in the prior year period. The current quarter includes increased amortization expense from intangible assets as a result of last fall’s acquisitions and contractor solutions as well as higher interest expense due to higher interest rates over the prior year. Our Contractor Solutions segment was $140 million of revenue, accounted for 69% of our consolidated revenue and delivered $2 million or 2% total growth as compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue growth was driven by the plumbing and architecturally specified building products end markets. Inorganic growth was $5.1 million in the quarter from the Cover Guard, AC Guard and Falcon acquisitions, offset by a 2% decrease in organic revenue. The organic revenue decrease was driven by a reduction in unit volumes, partially offset by pricing actions we have taken over the last couple of years. Segment EBITDA was $47 million or 33% of revenue compared to $43 million or 31% of revenue in the prior year period as our margins continue to expand. The increasing margins are from the company’s ability to maintain pricing even as certain costs in this segment have come down over the prior year. Our Specialized Reliability Solutions segment achieved another impressive quarter of organic revenue growth of $2 million or 6% due to the continued benefits from pricing initiatives, solid end-market demand, including energy and mining, and improvements in our operational execution. Segment EBITDA and EBITDA margin were $8 million and 22%, respectively, in the fiscal 2024 first quarter compared to $7 million and 19% in the prior year period. As Joe mentioned, with the ongoing addition of equipment in our Rockwall, Texas facility to support the Selwood more joint ventures, we are in a position to continue to post-compelling growth in this segment as we progress through the rest of our current fiscal year and into the next fiscal year. Our Engineered Building Solutions segment revenue declined slightly to $28 million, a 3% decrease compared to $29 million in the prior year period. Bidding and booking trends remain strong. In fact, our quarter end backlog increased by approximately 6% over the fiscal 2023 backlog close. At the end of the fiscal first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing 8 quarters was almost 1.2 to 1. We ended June with the sixth consecutive quarter of record backlog in this segment. Transitioning to the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fiscal 2024 first quarter with $15 million of cash and reported record cash flow from operations of $50 million compared to $17 million in the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $45.3 million in the fiscal first quarter as compared to $14.8 million in the same period a year ago. That resulted in free cash flow per share of $2.91 in the fiscal first quarter as compared to $0.95 in the same period a year ago. This impressive level of free cash flow fuels our risk-adjusted returns, capital allocation strategy, which, in turn, enhances shareholder value. As part of our broad capital allocation strategy, during the quarter, we paid down $43 million of our outstanding debt. We ended the fiscal first quarter with $210 million outstanding on our $500 million revolver. Our bank covenant leverage ratio as of the current quarter end was approximately 1.1x, an improvement from 1.3x at the end of fiscal 2023 due to our strong EBITDA growth. This leverage ratio now places us in the lowest tier of our revolving pricing grid, reducing our interest rate spread, which creates interest expense savings. As a reminder, in February of 2023, we entered into an interest rate hedge for the first $100 million of borrowings under our revolver. During the fiscal first quarter, this saved us $300,000 in interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was 25.2% on a GAAP basis. We still expect a tax rate of approximately 25% for fiscal 2024. As we look out to the rest of fiscal 2024, we still anticipate revenue growth for the full year, which when coupled with meaningful operating leverage, we expect will result in strong year-over-year EBITDA and EPS growth as well as strong cash flow generation. We expect to continue to benefit from stability in our raw material and freight costs as well as operational efficiencies. With that, I will now turn the call back to Joe for closing remarks.\nJoseph Armes: Thank you, James. Summarize, during the first fiscal quarter of 2024, we delivered record results, highlighted by expanded margins and robust cash flow. While there are headwinds in certain key end markets, we still expect to outperform the categories we serve and to deliver consolidated revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2024. We are focused on efficiency gains and cost reductions, and we are committed to providing our customers with high-quality products and customer service that they expect from CSWI. And we will rely on the dedication of our team members to accomplish that goal. We have expanded margins. We’ve driven cash flow conversion. We are confident in our near- and long-term opportunities for disciplined capital allocation, which is enabled by the strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to sustainable growth and shareholder value. By doing this in the past, we have consistently delivered outstanding financial results. We will utilize that same approach for the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond. At CSWI, we must and we will succeed. There’s no other option. But we also say at CSWI how we succeed matters. And everything we do is accomplished with a focus on environmental stewardship, the health and safety of our team members, which supports the growth we have seen since inception. Of note, we are trending very well this year in terms of our safety record. And I have a couple of examples that I would like to share. During the month of July, our TRUaire factory in Vietnam celebrated a new milestone of 365 days with no lost time injuries. And that translates to over 3.6 billion hours worked based on the number of team members we have at that facility. And at our Balco facility in Wichita, Kansas, we’re currently at over 4 years with no lost time injuries. We are extremely proud of both of those teams for achieving these important and admirable milestones, which are not only keeping our team members safe and healthy, but also contributing to our bottom line results. Achieving continued exceptional results over time demonstrates our commitment to be good stewards of your capital and to our goal of driving sustainable long-term shareholder value. As always, I want to close by thanking all of my colleagues here at CSWI, who collectively own approximately 5% of CSWI through our employee stock ownership plan as well as all of you, our shareholders, for your continued interest in and our support of our company. With that, Andre, we’re now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLee Jagoda: Hi, it’s actually Lee Jagoda on for John this morning. I guess just starting with the volumes in the quarter, how much of the lower volumes are related to inventory management at the distribution network versus sell-through at retail? And how should we think about those volume expectations over the next couple of quarters?\nJames Perry: Good morning, Lee, it’s James. Thanks for being a – thanks for your question. We don’t have the full sense of inventory management versus retail sales. A couple of data points though, and without giving other people’s data too much, the OEMs have talked about things being down double digits in the last quarter. We’re clearly outperforming that. So we’re outperforming the category given where we focus on the replacement, the maintenance and repair work, those kind of things. We’ve not gotten a great sense of destocking. I know a couple of the folks in the industry said that the destocking seems to be decelerating. So there may have been a little bit of that. we work through our inventory appropriately. Obviously, with more confidence in the supply chain now, you feel good about that. You saw us free up a little bit of inventory. But we would say, overall, that we’re outperforming the category despite some of those headwinds. Last thing I’ll mention and that you have more questions is it was a late start to the summer. So there may have been a little bit of the inventory management, so to speak. Again, no one called that up too much. But the summer really got going kind of late June and July. So normally kind of May, June, you start seeing things pick up in a pretty good way. If you look at the cooling days out there and the pulling degree days that are tracked each week, you were down 20%, 30% on a year-to-date basis for a while. Now your you’re down about 16% the last week that I saw. So July has made up a lot of ground. We saw early signs in July that the heat was certainly taking effect with our ability to sell product and the demand our customers had certainly picked up. But overall, I’d say there was a little bit of softness on the retail side, given the late summer in some of the regions, maybe a little bit of destocking. But overall, we feel good about our ability to continue to outperform those metrics.\nLee Jagoda: Great. And then I guess you talked a little bit about on the margin cost getting better, whether it’s freight or other raw materials. How do you see that as – in terms of like, are you still able to raise prices going forward or are you getting any pushback? How does that all shake out?\nJames Perry: Yes. Thanks, Lee. From a freight perspective, yes, we’ve certainly seen ocean freight settle in kind of a new low. It bounces around a little bit kind of sub 2,000 when you look at things from China to Long Beach in different parts at different prices. But it seems to have settled into kind of a new normal for now. Again, week-to-week, it bounces around. Domestic freight, which we haven’t talked about a whole lot in the past because ocean freight was such a big deal for a couple of years with the pandemic. Domestic freight costs have come down a little bit, too, with fuel costs lower. The price of oil, obviously, was lower over the last couple of quarters than it was a year ago. Last year, you were looking at $110, $120 per bare oil. This last quarter, you were looking more at 70% to 80%, and that’s lower diesel and gas prices as well. So that’s been a bit of a tailwind for us in terms of cost. We had our last round of normal price increases in the spring as we always do. I think our ability to hold on to that is where our focus is. I think at the current time, we will continue to watch cost. And if we see things move up, then we would take appropriate price action. But right now, I think the pricing environment across our businesses is pretty steady. We still feel confident in the ability to move things if we need to. But most importantly, what we’ve said for a couple of years, holding on to the pricing increases we got, while some costs have come down, has been important. There is still some cost pressures, things like labor. Labor is still tough, and so you see some pressure there. So we’re being careful and watching that. But again, operational leverage and margin expansion as we’ve raised the top line, some through pricing, some through acquisitions, some through unit growth in some of the key markets, while pricing come down has led to really loss margins.\nLee Jagoda: Got it. And then I guess one more high-level question, and I’ll hop back in the queue. It feels like every other day, we see headlines in the news about the hottest month ever hottest year on record. And obviously, there’s some that argue it’s a cyclical issue. There’s others to argue it’s a secular issue. How much of – how much of those kind of things, I guess, one, have impacted demand positively over the last several years? And I guess, how do you think about that, whether it’s cyclical, secular, etcetera, over the next several years as a driver of demand?\nJoseph Armes: Let me start, Lee and then James can add some detail. But I mean, certainly, we have seen temperatures rising and that’s a positive trend for us from a secular standpoint. Season by season will vary. As James said, we had a late start to the summer season this year, but it’s hotter now than it’s ever been. And so those things kind of come and go, and it’s – we’re not immune to that. But at the same time, the character of our products and the things that our products do, the value they add for our customers makes it more resilient than just following whatever the cycle is each year. So that gives us confidence. Our products are enhancing the performance of air conditioning systems. We’re making it easier for the technicians to do their job. We’re adding value to both the technician and to the homeowner, and we think that’s a great long-term strategy.\nJames Perry: Yes. All I would add, Lee, when you look at, as Joe said, the long-term trends, we can’t predict things, but I think it’s clear that overall, the temperatures are rising. One thing I’ll point out specifically that’s been a tailwind for us that we’ve highlighted before is our position in that Duct mini split markets. That’s a product category where you see in our investor presentation, we have a lot of products surrounding and mini split installation. And where that’s really been important is if you look in the West, the Northwest, the Northeast where they’ve historically not had air conditioning in a lot of places as temperatures have risen in the last few years and expectations is they would generally continue to reporting to the scientists. Those areas one air condition, and they’re in a lot of places where Duct work is not in those buildings. It’s not necessarily efficient to put in Duct work in certain places. So installation and mini slips, which continues to be a double-digit positive year-over-year type of unit growth over the last few years is really something we’ve leaned into, and we have a lot of products surrounding that. So that’s one thing that, as I mentioned earlier, has helped us outperform the overall just OEM ducted unitary category.\nLee Jagoda: That’s very helpful. Thanks very much.\nJoseph Armes: Thanks, Lee.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nAlex Hantman: Hi, good morning, Joe, James and Alexa. This is actually Alex Hantman on for Julio. Thanks for taking questions.\nJoseph Armes: Thanks, Alex.\nAlex Hantman: Yes. I wanted to start with the Contractor Solutions segment. I know the implications of stronger demand for new construction homes on the segment is repaired replacement driven. But with select lines such as grills, registered diffusers, would those fare better in this environment?\nJoseph Armes: They do. They are a little on a little different cycle than some of our other products. So new construction is certainly can drive the GRD business. Also refurbish and remodels, which we’re seeing feels like an uptick there as well with folks investing in their homes instead of selling their homes. We’ve read quite a bit about folks who have elected to stay in their existing homes because they’ve got cheap mortgages and instead of selling and moving up. They’re just spending money on their current house. And that’s another good opportunity for the GRD to be sold into that opportunity. So yes, there’s a little bit of difference in the cycle. Of course, it adds to the diversification of our products and the broader our product portfolio, the more opportunities for a homeowner to need and use our products. So we think that’s overall healthy for the long-term.\nAlex Hantman: Thank you. And on the Engineering Building Solutions segment side, can you talk about demand trends within the segment? What’s driving the strength in the backlog or the new products, focus on go-to-market. Basically, any color you could add would be helpful.\nJoseph Armes: Sorry, that’s for Engineered Building Solutions, you said?\nAlex Hantman: Yes.\nJoseph Armes: Yes, absolutely. It’s a couple of things. One is that team has done a really nice job of introducing some new products, some product enhancements, improvements that give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Also, they have been hyper-focused on more resilient parts of their market. As you can imagine, everybody reads a lot about office construction being maybe driven downward. And so they have, over the last few years, focused on institutional product type. And we still do a lot of high-rise residential. And so the residential market in that particular submarket has been very strong. Institutional is very strong, schools, hospitals, airports, those types of things. And so I think it’s targeting the right markets. I think it is providing new and enhanced products to the market. And I think we’ve just improved our go-to-market strategy overall in our professionalism in the field and our ability to kind of clearly communicate the value of our products to the market.\nAlex Hantman: Great context. Thank you. And last question here, still on EBS. Can you talk about the mix in the quarter of higher-margin products like railings or smoke curtains compared to last quarter.\nJoseph Armes: Yes. I would say no material changes there. I would say that there are some differences in margins among some of the products. And so that’s why we have kind of really enterprise-wide really try to focus our commercial efforts on the higher margin products. We can literally increase earnings through mix. And that’s just a matter of emphasis, a matter of focus, a matter of execution on the commercial side, on the sales side to focus on those higher-margin products within each of the segments, and we’re seeing some results in that regard. And our internal reporting, folks are beginning to report on kind of byproduct line. And when you recognize and realize some of the margin differentials it really does focus you on the right products to be out selling and focusing on and really expanding your time, effort and energy on.\nAlex Hantman: Thank you, very helpful.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to CSWI for any closing remarks.\nJoseph Armes: Great, Andre. Thank you so much. We just want to say thank you to everyone for joining us today and appreciate your interest in CSWI.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Goodbye."
