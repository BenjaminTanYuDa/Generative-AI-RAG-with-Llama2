After this speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jackie Marcus with the Alpha IR Group, who will review our agenda today and the company's forward-looking statements. Jackie?\nJackie Marcus: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's earnings conference call.

Golnar?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before diving into our performance in the third fiscal quarter, I want to take a moment to recognize our songwriters and artists who brought home Grammy Awards this past Sunday. Our roster earned an impressive 39 Grammy nominations across 28 categories and contributed to 10 wins, including Joni Mitchell's Best Folk Album, a sweep by Killer Mike across the 3 rap categories and best R&B song for Khris Riddick-Tynes collaboration Snooze by SZA. Their nominations and wins are a testament to the caliber of talent we represent at Reservoir. Beyond these accolades, another marker of success for our roster is seen by consumption and activity on the charts. As reported by Billboard's publishers quarterly, Reservoir earned a hot 100 top 10 market share for the three quarters reported so far for calendar 2023. One of our top consumed songs, Snooze by SZA, co-written and co-produced by Khris Riddick-Tynes, was a hot 100 chart staple over the last year, generating over 0.5 billion on-demand audio streams alone. These achievements validate the talent and consistency of our roster and confirm the effectiveness of our team's strategy in signing and developing today's top hit-makers. Moving to our operational and financial performance in the third fiscal quarter, we continue to report strong growth numbers, underpinned by healthy organic growth mirroring that of the wider music industry. Luminate, the industry standard measurement platform for tracking music sales, streams, downloads and airplay, issued its year-end music report, which highlighted 34% year-over-year volume growth for total on-demand song streams globally in 2023. This includes over 13% year-over-year volume growth in US catalog total album consumption as well as an 11% growth in current total album consumption. As hip-hop celebrated its 50th anniversary, the genre continued to lead all others in US consumption, contributing to over a quarter of all streaming consumption. Additionally, Luminate reported more than 20% annual growth in the on-demand audio streams of both Latin and country genres in the U.S. These figures are another strong endorsement of our efforts to further invest in these genres in the calendar year 2023. Included in these investments were the additions of rapper, Armani White, hip-hop producer, Mannie Fresh, and songwriter producer, Willy Will Yanez, country music producers and songwriters, Brent Maher, Rob Ragosta, Christian Stalnecker and Paul Cauthen, and influential Latin songwriter and producer, Rudy Perez, and Miami Sound Machine Co-Founder, Kiki Garcia. Moreover, Luminate's report also suggests the potential for India to overtake the US as the country with the highest overall streaming volume globally. While India's streaming volume is currently just shy of the US's, the country saw the biggest year-over-year increase in total on-demand music streams of any nation with an increase of nearly 0.5 trillion streams, while the US volume increased by 184 billion. At that rate, we could see India surpass the US in 2024. What's more, Luminate reported that the Hindi language music market share has more than doubled from 2021 to 2023, up to nearly 8%, and also noted over 60% of both Gen Z and millennial listener groups listen to new music to experience new cultures and perspectives. We are excited by the implications of this data. And as we enter 2024, we remain committed to investing accordingly in opportunities in this market and continuing to build relationships on the ground to support regional music and its exportation to consumers across the world. On the financial side, for the fiscal third quarter, we delivered top line growth of 19%, 14% of which was organic. We also expanded our margins in the quarter, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 25% over the prior year. These financial results allowed us to once again beat our guidance for the quarter and, as Jim will discuss shortly, raise guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. In addition, they demonstrate our ability to manage the business and deploy capital to further grow our portfolio. Along those lines, during the quarter, we continued to invest in our business with an emphasis on further diversifying our portfolio across various music genres. Some of our recent deals include a new publishing deal with songwriter, producer, singer and multi-instrumentalist, Theo Katzman, best known as a founding member of American funk band, Vulfpeck. Theo has released four solo albums and collaborated with a wide range of artists across genres, including Kesha, Carly Rae Jepsen, Teddy Geiger and more. We also announced the co-signing of Australian singer-songwriter, Grentperez, to a worldwide publishing deal for his entire catalog and future works. This collaborative project with our Australian sub-publisher, Mushroom Music, sees our two companies come together on all creative and administrative aspects of Grentperez's career to take his music to new heights in the U.S., Australia and beyond. Lastly, in conjunction with PopArabia, we expanded our presence in the Middle East with a deal with In2Musica, the label, publisher and production house of Lebanese Superstar, Nancy Ajram. The deal includes her entire catalog and future works. With a combined total of 90 million followers across social media, she was the most streamed female Arab artist on Spotify in 2022, achieving more than 100 million plays of her songs, solidifying her moniker as the Queen of Arab Pop. With respect to our pipeline of opportunities, we are actively evaluating multiple potential deals that will support our growth aspirations. Our pipeline sits roughly at $2 billion in total value for prospective deals, which I'd like to note does not include off-market opportunities that also remain strong. We remain a highly respected and regarded partner, and our proven reputation for being a strong steward for catalogs through our value-enhancement initiatives allows us to acquire some of the best assets on the market. We look forward to closing out the fiscal fourth quarter in a position of strength with new artists joining our roster and achieving our full year financial guidance, which Jim will address shortly. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter numbers in greater detail. Jim?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Thank you, Golnar, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results, headlined by meaningful revenue growth in both of our business segments and our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EBITDA improvement. Our accomplishments in the quarter represent Reservoir's commitment to consistent growth on both top and bottom lines. Turning to our fiscal third quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $35.5 million, which was a 19% increase versus the prior year quarter when including acquisitions. This was driven by growth in both business segments, highlighted by a 32% year-over-year increase in Recorded Music. Turning to our operating expenses for the quarter. Our overall cost of revenue increased 13% versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher revenue for the quarter. Amortization and depreciation costs increased 14% year-over-year, driven by our continued catalog acquisitions. Company administration expenses increased 17% versus the prior year period, primarily due to higher compensation costs, increased marketing spend for Recorded Music and higher fees for artists and managers associated with the higher revenue in that segment. In the third quarter, OIBDA increased 27% year-over-year to $12.9 million. For those of you who are newer to our business model, OIBDA is a common non-GAAP KPI used in the music industry that stands for operating income before depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA increased 25% compared to the year to $13.7 million. The increases in both OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA were driven by strong revenue growth or partially offset by higher administrative expenses. Interest expense was $5.4 million for the third quarter compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year. Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $2.9 million versus $4.1 million in the prior year quarter. This resulted in a net loss per share of $0.05. The decrease in net loss was driven by the higher revenue and improved gross margins, but was partially offset by a higher loss on the fair value of our interest rate swaps as well as higher administration expense, amortization expense and interest expense. Our weighted average diluted outstanding share count during the quarter was 64.8 million. Let's turn to our performance by segment for the quarter, starting with Music Publishing. Music Publishing generated revenue of $23.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. This was driven by a 30% year-over-year gain in Digital revenue and a 9% improvement in Synchronization revenue, but was partially offset by a 3% decline in Performance revenue. In our Recorded Music segment, third quarter revenue was $10 million, representing an increase of 32% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. All revenue types within our Recorded Music segment delivered double-digit percentage year-over-year increases, most notably led by Synchronization revenue, which increased 101% versus the prior year quarter. Physical and Digital revenue increased by 51% and 26%, respectively, and Neighboring Rights revenue increased 16%. I want to highlight the notable sequential improvement in our Sync revenue for both segments. While we did see lumpiness in our performance due to the writer and actor strikes in calendar 2023, which caused delays in production schedules, we saw significant improvement in demand for our catalog within the advertising market. The current ad market is very promising. And although we have yet to work through the full impact of the strikes, we feel well positioned to capture synchronization growth opportunities across both our segments as production schedules return to normal. Now turning to our balance sheet. We closed the quarter with total available liquidity of $121.7 million comprised of $19.5 million of cash on hand and $102.2 million available under our revolver. This gives us ample capital to continue to fund our strategic growth objectives. We ended the quarter with total debt of $342.5 million, which was net of $5.4 million of deferred financing costs, bringing net debt to $323 million. That compares to net debt of $296.6 million as of March 31, 2023. We've hedged nearly half of our debt at attractive interest rates, which reduced some of our exposure to higher interest rates in the calendar year. While more recently, interest rate increases have begun to level off, we expect our hedging strategy to continue to mitigate our interest expense in the 2024 calendar year. Finally, I'd like to touch on our outlook for the remainder of the 2024 fiscal year. We are raising our guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the year to incorporate our strong third quarter results. For revenue, we're raising our guidance from our prior range of $133 million to $137 million to a range of $140 million to $142 million. This represents 15% growth at the midpoint of our range. We now expect adjusted EBITDA for the year to be between $53 million and $55 million, which represents 16.5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our strategy of prioritizing organic growth while making accretive acquisitions and will maintain a responsible capital deployment approach. We look forward to closing out the year within our updated guidance expectations for fiscal 2024. With that, I'll now pass the call back to Golnar for closing remarks.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, Jim. As we look ahead, we remain committed to operating the business with rigor as we navigate a dynamic economic backdrop and as the music industry continues to grow. We are confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets, which have been raised and narrowed on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our pipeline remains very active globally and across both business segments. With the support of consistent and predictable cash flows, we anticipate continuing to execute deals well within our expected return profile. With that, we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Richard Baldry with ROTH MKM. Your line is open.\nRichard Baldry: Thanks. Given the focus on international, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing there that's attractive? Is it the greater growth opportunities? Or are there the pace of their organic growth or deal terms themselves on initiation? Or is it really a blend of the both? And then maybe you can talk about whether there's a bias internationally toward either recording or publishing. Thanks.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Good morning, Rich. I think it's a combination of all of the factors that you mentioned. We are able to execute in those markets at very attractive pricing, which makes for attractive returns. There is the promise of future growth that we are intrigued by as subscription numbers grow, as access to platforms develops. So that makes it significantly attractive to us. The thesis being that we would like to be in a position to be content owners in the international markets on the cusp and ahead of how these markets grow and consumption grows and streaming grows, which will then translate into the associated revenues, and that's what makes it captivating for us.\nRichard Baldry: And can you talk about sort of the go-to-market model in all those countries? Do you have the feet on the ground? Is it something that can be done remotely? Do you feel like you have adequate resources in the right regions? Or do you need to sort of add to that as you get better with more reps and more and more deals in those regions?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: We generally subscribe to the idea that you have to have feet on the ground and develop relationships with people and move those relationships forward. I'm not really a big fan of doing business by proxy in those markets. Hence, our operation at PopArabia, which allows us to really extend that reach in the MENA region as well as in India, where we do represent talent and have already begun developing that business. So it's -- because this is very much a relationship-driven business with artists and catalog sellers, et cetera, it's important to have feet on the ground, and we have had those feet on the ground for several years now. So we are very well positioned to execute there.\nRichard Baldry: And maybe looking at the organic growth side of the table, can you maybe estimate or qualitatively even, how far into recognizing royalty rate increases from the various CRB settlements, et cetera? Do you feel like you're -- that's a rolling sort of recognition is my understanding. Do you feel like you're halfway into that? Is that still a pretty good tailwind for '24, '25? How do we think about that as a driver?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yeah. I think -- this is Jim, Rich. So I think when we think about those rate increases, we're still comparing the current quarter of December '23 against December '22. December '22, we were still in a position of really estimating and accruing what we thought that final quarter of CRB III would be. We obviously have much more visibility and real data in the current year where we're being accounted under the CRB IV rates. So there's still a little bit of that -- of those tailwinds that are helping in our organic growth in the current quarter. And I think that we will continue to potentially see that going into, let's say, Q1 of next year, our June quarter, as we look forward to the full resolution of the CRB III rate increase where the DSPs will, within the next couple of days, be remitting that money to the MLC and it will flow through to rights holders a few months after that. So once we see those true-ups, my expectation is that as we work through that, that will kind of be the end of that lumpiness, if you will, related to the rate increase there.\nRichard Baldry: Thanks. last one for me. Q4 has typically been very seasonally strong. The guidance sort of implies it's more sideways this year. Are there any unusual onetime impacts in Q3 that we should think about taking out that would explain that or think just typical conservatism?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yeah. I think that I've mentioned this on some of our previous calls, but one of our ongoing focuses is improving how we handle accruals. You're obviously aware that in this business, there can be some significant lags in how revenue is accounted to us. And we have an ongoing goal of improving the accuracy of our accruals. And as we go through that, that will naturally lead to some flattening of our quarter-over-quarter fluctuations. And I think that that's partly what we are seeing is, if you go back a couple of years, you will see much higher spikes in the September and March quarter and lower valleys in the June and December quarters. And now we're seeing a little bit of a smoother quarter-over-quarter cadence with our revenue. There's nothing in particular in the third quarter that I think needs to be called out. And that's also part of the reason why when you see our adjusted guidance, you really see that the third quarter performance reflected in our increases for the full year guidance.\nRichard Baldry: Great. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter.\nJim Heindlmeyer: Thank you.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nAlex Fuhrman: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question here. Jim, it's crossed my mind here that since Reservoir has been a public company, you've often reported a very strong Q1 or Q3 and then gone on to caution investors that you really view your business in two halves and that, to some extent, the strong quarter may have pulled some revenue and earnings out of the upcoming quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what makes this quarter different and what really gives you the confidence to be pretty significantly raising your full year guidance here?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Well, we're only one quarter until the end of the year. So obviously, as we get closer to the end of the year, we have more confidence in where we will end the year. And I think that that's something that we will continue. As we get close to the end of the year, we will always have better visibility and higher confidence in where we will end the year. I think that with respect to Q3, we really just saw a very strong performance, whether it's in the Digital revenue type or in Synchronization, where we had very strong revenue related to advertising. And that's not something that we look at as being pulled forward from Q4. So we remain confident in how we will do in Q4, and we were able to raise our guidance to reflect the outperformance in Q3.\nAlex Fuhrman: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then, Golnar, there's been a lot of headlines recently about the use of music on social media and TikTok, in particular. Has there been any change to how your music is used or paid for on social media? And do you see maybe opportunities for the industry to better monetize that channel over time?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Good morning, Alex. I think social media, fill in the blank, as far as the platform goes has been an area where we have historically partnered with the NMPA and ensured the use -- that the use of music is legally licensed and fairly compensated for. We stand with the NMPA and in this latest action with -- Universal's latest action with TikTok. And we stand with our songwriters, obviously, and rights holders. It's always going to be an issue in the sense that these are platforms where the content is being distributed some -- a lot of times, many times before the legal licensing actually is put in place. And that is a battle that we will continue to fight such that we can get to a place where we're actually compensated and the music is legally licensed. And we have quite a bit of history showing that, that can happen and that these platforms can continue to thrive using the music that is both through user-generated content as well as other kinds of content that results in additional revenue for us.\nAlex Fuhrman: Okay. That’s really helpful, Golnar. Appreciate that insight.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Dan Day with B. Riley Securities. Your line is open.\nDan Day: Yeah. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple for me. The bigger DSP, Spotify, a couple of others, they put through a lot of rate hikes throughout 2023. I appreciate the color on the CRB tailwinds. Just whether you think these were fully reflected in the December quarter, the rate hikes I'm referring to? Or do you think there's still some tailwinds as these price hikes get pushed out to more and more subscribers?\nJim Heindlmeyer: How are you doing Dan? It's Jim here. So I think with respect to the -- there's kind of two parts to your question. On the price increases, we're obviously very happy with what's happened over the past year with those price increases, and we are looking forward to maybe a more regular cadence of price increases. Having gone 10, 12 years with no price increase, we are certainly looking forward to more regular improvements there. With the rates, as I mentioned earlier, I think that we are still seeing some tailwinds in the quarter as we are currently being accounted under the CRB IV rates and comparing that to the prior year, where we were really estimating under the CRB III rates. And so while there's a little bit of tailwind there in this quarter, we think that those tailwinds will be fully reflected when we get the final CRB III true-ups, which we are looking forward to in the coming months as the DSPs work with the MLC to push that money through.\nDan Day: Okay. Great. Another question for me, kind of higher level one. Just wondering how you're either currently using or thinking about using any of these generative AI tools maybe to enhance the productivity of your roster of songwriters, anything you're investing behind there? And just really anything else you think worth mentioning about generative AI and its current or potential future impact on the songwriting industry would be great.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Sure. I think there are a lot of tools that enhance efficiencies insofar as production goes, and we are seeing these develop in the studio. And we have songwriters who are already using these tools, not in a way that is threatening to the existence of the songwriter and of themselves. And I think there's a little bit of noise and misinterpretation around that side of things in that there are a lot of positive outcomes that are -- that we are seeing as a result of these tools. We are obviously very well informed about the developments, legal developments insofar as how these tools are using existing IP. And that is an area that we will champion the rights of our songwriters as well as ourselves to ensure that IP is not being used to develop new IP that is based on that existing product. And compensation for that and recognition of that is obviously very important for us. And then internally in the business, we are using all kinds of AI tools in -- through our marketing department, through our deal team, et cetera, and we are seeing some greater efficiencies there.\nDan Day: All right. Great. Appreciate it and I’ll turn it over.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thanks, Dan.\nJim Heindlmeyer: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Golnar Khosrowshahi for any closing remarks.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, operator, and to everyone who joined us today. We are proud of and honored to work with some of music's most important songwriters, producers and artists across genres and eras. And we look forward to updating you on our full fiscal year performance. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Our second fiscal quarter was highlighted by topline growth of 15% with strong performances from both our Music Publishing and Recorded Music businesses. We reported healthy organic growth in the period driven by our value enhancement capabilities, and we executed numerous high-quality deals that further diversified and expanded our portfolio. In addition to continuing our revenue growth in Q2, we also thoughtfully managed our business as we both enhanced our margin profile and grew adjusted EBITDA by 24% over the prior year. Our financial results in the first half of fiscal 2024 demonstrate the benefits of our disciplined approach to capital allocation and our ability to drive growth and close deals within any market backdrop. The music industry's resiliency across all market cycles, combined with our cost management and capital allocation, continues to fortify us against a complicated economic backdrop. Recently, the National Music Publishers Association, or NMPA, estimated double-digit year-over-year growth for the entire U.S. music publishing market in calendar year 2023. This marks the eighth consecutive year where U.S. Music Publishing revenues experienced double-digit growth. Further, there have been no signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth from streaming services amid subscription price increases. Spotify announced a 16% growth year-over-year in premium subscribers despite its price increase. These are raised subscription pricing for the second time in 12 months and Apple increased the price of several of its bundled subscription services. This activity suggests not only that we should expect price increases to occur with some regularity moving forward, but also demonstrates the stickiness of consumers and the market opportunity for digital music consumption for what continues to be one of the most under-monetized forms of entertainment content. We are confident in the growth trajectory for the industry, and we are particularly pleased with how Reservoir will continue to benefit from this growth as well as the growing recognition that artists work has been undervalued in the ecosystem. Before we get into our new deals and financial performance, I want to take a moment to call out some of our rosters recent achievements. Last week, we celebrated Sheryl Crow and The Spinners inductions into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Blue Raincoat management client, Ezra Collective, became the first ever Jazz act to take home the Mercury prize. This quarter saw chart-topping hits across genres from David Guetta and Bebe Rexha's hit song, I'm Good (Blue), spending 55 weeks at #1 on Billboard's Hot Dance electronic song chart to Jelly Roll, Need A Favor, co-written by Rob Ragosta, climbing to #1 on both Country Airplay and Mainstream Rock Airplay, making it the first song to do so. Additionally, SZA single, Snooze, a collaboration by our writer/producer, Khris Riddick-Tynes, topped several billboard charts and helped propel the album SOS to become the longest-running #1 on billboards R&B albums chart spending 45 weeks at the top. Over the past few months, we made several accretive strategic investments, diversifying our portfolio across genres and eras. Some of the deals we recently announced include legendary guitarist, songwriter and vocalist, Joe Walsh. The deal includes hits from his catalog as a solo artist and as a member of groups like the Eagles and the James Gang plus his future works. Joe contributed to Hotel California, one of the best-selling albums of all time, and we are honored to be his publishing home and to support his high-quality catalog. We also welcomed genre defining Latin writer producer, Rudy Perez to the roster. The deal includes the acquisition of his catalog, including hits performed by Christina Aguilera, Julio Iglesias and more as well as a publishing deal for his future works, leveraging his impressive legacy. Rudy is also the co-founder of the Latin Reporting Academy, the Latin Grammys and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame. We are proud to be in business with such an important steward for the genre and its creators. We expanded our international roster with the additions of content production and distribution company, RE media and Egyptian rap duo El Sawareekh. These deals were executed in conjunction with PopArabia, and we're pleased to further grow our presence in the region as we see an untapped opportunity for music in these regions to grow both locally and globally. We bolstered our country music roster and catalog with the additions of The Judds collaborator, Brent Maher; decorated writer/producer, Kerry Kurt Phillips; emerging hitmaker, Cam Becker; and history making cross genre, writer-producer, Rob Ragosta. We're thrilled to build on our catalog of established country titles while also developing the new class of hit country creators. We also signed a publishing deal for the future works of platinum selling songwriter Steph Jones. Steph has contributed to #1 albums by Selena Gomez, Celine Dion, P!nk, Keith Urban and Panic! At The Disco and collectively garnered billions of streams throughout her discography. Looking ahead, we are working through a robust pipeline of deals with the objective of continuing to complete transactions that exceed our return expectations. As a business rooted in acquisitions, we have a rigorous underwriting process, and we have a strong track record of deploying capital that ultimately becomes accretive to our margin profile. We have a pipeline of roughly $2 billion in total value for prospective deals, and we see no slowdown in our off-market opportunities. We also believe that with each quarter, as we build our roster and catalog, our reputation as trusted stewards of music with a differentiated approach to value enhancement continues to grow. We see that reflected in the artists [indiscernible] who come to us as we explore opportunities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter numbers in greater detail. Jim?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Thank you, Golnar, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're announcing another quarter of strong financial results. Our ability to consistently grow revenue and improve operating leverage from quarter-to-quarter is a testament to the durability of our business model coupled with the Reservoir team's expertise and core competencies. Turning to our fiscal second quarter results. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $38.4 million, a 15% increase versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by growth in both business segments, most notably led by a 22% increase in recorded music compared to the prior year quarter. Looking at our operating expenses for the quarter. Our overall cost of revenue increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. Amortization and depreciation costs increased 15% year-over-year due to our continued catalog acquisitions. Company administration expenses saw a 57% increase versus the prior year, largely due to a $2.7 million noncash write-off of recoupable legal expenses. I'd like to add a bit more color on that write-off of recoupable legal expenses that occurred during the quarter. This nonrecurring item relates to the resolution of a matter, which began in 2017 that we settled through mediation, requiring us to expense legal fees from prior years that we had previously expected to recoup, resulting in a onetime write-off of $2.7 million. As a result, we are excluding it from adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, but it does impact operating income and OIBDA. In the second quarter, notwithstanding the write-off I just mentioned, OIBDA increased 3% year-over-year to $12.4 million, while adjusted EBITDA of $15.9 million increased 24% versus the prior year. The increase in OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher administrative expenses. Interest expense was $5.8 million for the second quarter compared to $3.5 million in the same period last year. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately $700,000 versus $4.5 million in the prior year quarter. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.01. The decrease in net income was driven by higher administrative expenses, including the write-off I discussed as well as higher amortization and interest expense, partially offset by higher revenue and improved gross margins. Lastly, our weighted average diluted outstanding share count during the quarter was $65.1 million. Now I'll review our segment breakdown for the quarter, starting with Music Publishing. Music Publishing generated revenue of $25.9 million in the second quarter, which represents an 8% increase from the same period last year due to strong growth in performance and mechanical revenue, partially offset by a decrease in digital revenue. Mechanical revenue within the Publishing segment increased 25% year-over-year to $1.3 million. Lastly, synchronization revenue was up 1% compared to the prior year period, while other revenue was down 5%. The decrease in digital revenue was driven by the nonrecurrence of the onetime $2.1 million Copyright Royalty Board retroactive adjustment booked in the prior year period. As we shared on the last call, the year-over-year revenue comparison in Q2 is muted as a result of the retroactive adjustment for the affirmed CRB 3 rates that we recorded in Q2 of last year. If we were to adjust that out of last year's figures, publishing revenue would have grown 18% and total revenue would be up 23%. Our Recorded Music segment delivered strong results in the second quarter with revenue of $10.8 million, representing an increase of 22% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding synchronization, all revenue types within our Recorded Music segment delivered year-over-year increases. Growth in the Recorded Music segment was primarily driven by physical revenue, which increased 122% versus the prior year. Digital and neighboring rights revenue increased 15% and 8%, respectively. Synchronization revenue in the Recorded Music segment came in at $900,000, resulting in a 12% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This was driven by the timing of the writer skilled and SAG strikes which created a pause in television and film production-based sync opportunities. Moving on to our balance sheet. We closed the quarter with total liquidity of $132.8 million, comprised of $20.6 million of cash on hand and $112.2 million available under our revolver, which gives us the capital to fund our strategic objectives. We ended the quarter with total debt of $332.1 million, which was net of $5.7 million of deferred financing costs bringing net debt to $311.6 million. That compares to net debt of $311.5 million as of March 31, 2023. Finally, as interest rates remain elevated, I'd like to remind you that we have managed to hedge nearly half of our debt at highly attractive interest rates, which will help limit our exposure to interest rate expense in coming months should rates continue to rise. Before I turn the call back over to Golnar, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for fiscal 2024. Following the second consecutive quarter of strong results, we're raising our revenue guidance from a previous range of $127 million to $132 million to a range of $133 million to $137 million, which represents a 10% increase versus fiscal 2023 at the midpoint. We're also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $49 million to $52 million, to $50 million to $52 million, which implies 10% growth at the midpoint. A strong release schedule, most notably driven by the successful release of [indiscernible] back catalog led to better-than-expected results in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, we expect revenue to be down slightly versus the first half as we work through the impact of the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild strikes and return to a normalized release cadence on physical product. While our revenue will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities across categories and genres. As we progress against our growth plan, we will continue to make accretive strategic acquisitions while prioritizing organic growth. We will continue to follow our responsible capital deployment strategy to maintain our strong financial profile, and we are confident in our line of sight to meet our new guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. With that, I'll now pass the call back to Golnar.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, Jim. As Jim mentioned, we are raising our fiscal year guidance on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We will continue to focus on optimizing the operations of our existing business while executing on our inorganic growth strategy by pursuing high-quality deals. Regarding the broader music industry, we anticipate no slowdown to growth, and we are confident in our competitive positioning. All of this, along with our business model that supports highly predictable cash flows, positions Reservoir to execute against our targets and start the second half of the fiscal year strong. With that, we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Day with B. Riley Securities.\nDan Day: So you haven't dropped the 10-Q yet, so I haven't seen exactly what the catalog acquisition number is. But just given that the gross debt didn't move much and the press release was a little more concentrated on publishing deals, maybe if you could just give us an update on the market for music copyrights acquisition right now, whether or not we're finally seeing a long-awaited decline in transaction multiples just given what you've seen out there and just what your acquisition pipeline looks like right now?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Dan, I wish I could tell you that we have conclusive evidence of contraction in pricing, but we're still seeing a lot of demand for assets and continued infusion of new capital within the competitive set and that is certainly fueling the demand. The pipeline is robust, and it ranges in size from large to a lot of smaller deals. It's equally balanced between recorded and publishing assets. And as much as one would think that the environment would drive some pricing contraction, we're not really seeing it within a subset of high-quality assets and scarce assets.\nDan Day: Understood. Other question, just -- there's been a lot of headlines lately around the handful of music royalty funds that formed over in the U.K. over the last couple of years for better or worse, I think sometimes people associate your business with them just because of the publishing exposure. Some of them have seen results come in, maybe disappointing relative to expectations running up against debt covenants. It doesn't seem like you've had any similar challenges at all. So maybe just talk about like why you're different? Is it just kind of the age of catalog, maybe you're not as exposed to the decay curve? Anything else to point to why they might be struggling a bit more than you have been?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Sure. I mean we've taken a very diligent approach to our underwriting and how we value these assets. We've always approached it quite conservatively. -- until we have really compelling data around the future growth. And so we have then benefited today from having purchased assets over the course of the past 16 years anywhere in those early days from a 2x multiple to certainly higher than that more recently. So very simply, we bought very well. And we continue to apply that same rigor today. I think a lot of the noise that has come up and that you're referring to, specifically had to do with accruals and how those were treated as they relate to CRB3 and those new royalty rates. And that was, again, a disciplined approach that was conservative and pretty linear calculation for us as far as what that impact was going to have, and we started accruing that at the end of September, of last year and then added to that for the -- our fiscal third quarter. And so we don't really have any surprises happening there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Baldry with ROTH Capital.\nRich Baldry: Sort of curious, we've seen some other industries, people willing to start taking either all or half of their hedges off the table with a view that rates could be peaking here. Do you have any thoughts around that for your own sort of hedging plans or outlooks? Or do you just feel it's simpler to leave it on for the duration and cap your risk at that?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yes, Rich. I think for us, we look at our hedges, and we have about $150 million hedged through the end of next September. And while we've certainly had discussions about taking those off the table for us, I think that we look at it as leaving them in place through the maturity of those hedges is likely what we're going to do. We've also added another future start $100 million to our hedge because we want to be in a position of managing our interest rate risk. We've always taken that type of approach with our hedges, and I think that we will continue to.\nRich Baldry: Okay. And then OpEx, if you back out the onetime recoupable fee kind of hit, went down a little bit sequentially. So how do we think about OpEx? You're talking about second half because of some headwinds would be possibly down on the revenue side. How do we think about the trends on the OpEx side in the second half?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yes. I think we're always trying our best to manage our overhead. I think we've typically done a pretty good job of that. Of course, we're in the same environment that everyone else is right now with the macro forces that are affecting us. Having said that, I think that backing out that $2.7 million from our -- the current quarter probably gets us to a pretty good run rate at this point.\nRich Baldry: Okay. And if you think about the recent royalty increases, the price increases, those don't all drop at the second that they happen under your P&L, right? So is there a way to think about how far into recognizing those sort of run rate step-ups you are, how much of a tailwind that could be for either 6 months, 12 months, whatever kind of time frame?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yes. There's certainly a little bit of a delay there, but it's not a very significant delay, right? DSPs in the U.S. anyway, typically, are reporting those royalties on a monthly basis to the MLC. We see that money 3 months after that. And we accrue for that. So we have our estimates of the streaming activity. We make our estimates of what's in the pipeline, and we recognize that revenue. So it's not a significant delay in the U.S. Now as things happen internationally, there's certainly more of a delay there and there will be some tailwinds that lag a little bit as a result of that.\nRich Baldry: And last for me, it's sort of more high level. But in September, we watched Round Hill get acquired. It looked like the tail price was somewhere around 15x gross profit or 21x EBITDA. How similar to your business is that -- like I'm trying to figure out, like is that an outlier because they had some sort of quality asset that people were paying a dramatic premium for? Or how bread and butter was it and that's simply a fair takeout price in this space in your view?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: I don't think so much of an outlier on an asset value basis. These assets are -- that's about the right valuation. And that asset certainly had some good scale around it. So I don't really think there was any anything outlier about that. It was a high-quality catalog. And so it traded at that multiple.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nAlex Fuhrman: Congratulations on another really strong quarter here. Golnar, can you talk about some of the investments that you've made recently in emerging markets? And just more broadly, as you look at acquiring content and partnerships and companies overseas, are you seeing multiples that are maybe more attractive in emerging markets than in the U.S.? And just any color there would be helpful?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Sure, Alex. The investments that we make and the deals that we do in the Middle East, via Pop/Arabia certainly cover different kinds of transactions where we are acquiring record labels, where we are adding artists to the roster. So a lot of diversity happening there and so far as how the deals are structured and what we're doing and how we're expanding the business. We certainly -- I mean, you're absolutely right to ask this question. It is a market where we are able to execute on these transactions today at a lower multiple. And so that's one of the reasons it's attractive, coupled with the growth trajectory, makes the future at least the next 5 to 10 years in that region, including the [indiscernible] highly attractive for us to invest in content that is relevant to that demographic. So the business plan there is to continue to execute. And if we're looking at a market here that is somewhat saturated with a lot of capital in the marketplace and we're able to execute at these lower multiples, it makes it just that much more attractive to us.\nAlex Fuhrman: That's terrific. And then just quickly, looking at your revenue by channel here. It looks like [indiscernible] revenue for both Recorded Music and Music Publishing, growth was less than the overall business lines. Does that say something about demand for streaming relative to demand for advertising? Or is there maybe something about the way the CRB drew up fell into your numbers last year. We would love to just get a little bit more color on that.\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yes. Alex, the takeaway on sync should really be that the overall industry, I would say, has been affected by the writer and actor strike. When film and television production shuts down, those opportunities are paused until production resumes. So we're certainly affected by the strike, and we likely will continue to be affected by the strike for the next couple of quarters. The writer strike has been resolved. And hopefully, the actor strike is close to being resolved, but it hasn't been yet. So once that's resolved and everyone gets back to work, we'll then start to see those opportunities come back, could be a few months after production resumes. So we certainly think that there's another quarter or 2 to be impacted by the strike and that's why you're seeing what you're seeing in the historic numbers for this quarter and the first half of the year, and that's certainly what we're looking at for the second half of the year.\nOperator: And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Golnar Khosrowshahi for closing remarks.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, operator, and to everyone who joined us today. We believe we have a bright future with considerable opportunities to both expand our roster of talented creators while also generating significant returns with our pursuit of value-enhancing initiatives, and we look forward to updating you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Jackie Marcus with the Alpha IR Group, who will review our agenda today and the company's forward-looking statements. Jackie?\nJackie Marcus: Thank you, Justin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's earnings conference call. Reservoir Media issued a press release with results for its first quarter of fiscal 2024 and ended June 30, 2023, earlier this morning. If you did not receive a copy of our earnings press release, you may access it from our Investor Relations section of our website at investors.reservoir-media.com. With me on today's call are Golnar Khosrowshahi, Southern Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Heindlmeyer, Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this call is being simultaneously webcast and will be recorded and archived on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Golnar and Jim, I'd like to note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Reservoir media about our business, financial performance and future events, and as such, involve certain risks and uncertainties. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that our expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Please refer to our earnings press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information on the specific risk uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, beliefs and projections described in today's discussion.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings press release. I would now like to turn the call over to Golnar.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We are off to an exceptional start to the year as we delivered strong growth across both our Music Publishing and Recorded Music businesses. Our continued execution, strong secular tailwinds in the industry, and momentum in digital from streaming services as well as the impact of increased CRB 4 rates drove top line growth of 31% during the quarter. In addition to this revenue growth, we saw adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 100 basis points versus the prior year period. This financial performance also reflects our strategy of expanding our roster of creators across genres and geographies. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital deployment, and we will continue to pursue business development opportunities that enhance our roster and are accretive to margins. Before turning the call over to Jim to further discuss our first quarter results, I'd like to talk through some of the drivers of the results in more detail. The strong results we achieved in digital reflect increasing demand trends for streaming music globally, something we saw evidence of in Spotify's higher-than-expected subscriber numbers reported last week. Another reason for our success in digital during the quarter was the adoption of the new CRB 4 rates, starting in calendar 2023, with a headline rate of 15.15% and a meaningful increase from the CRB 2 rates, which applied during the first quarter of last year. Because of this, we have been able to recognize higher revenue associated with mechanical royalties from digital sources. As a note, when comparing year-over-year results, the benefit of the increased CRB 4 rate will be less significant in coming quarters as we recorded revenue using the affirmed CRB 3 rate starting in Q2 of fiscal 2023. Nonetheless, as we have said before, these increases are a step in the right direction of recognizing the value our artist spring to these platforms. We remain confident about the growth trajectory of the global music industry, and how Reservoir is positioned to capitalize on it. We believe that one factor behind our success to date is the exceptional team we have built over the last 16 years. Studies have shown that companies with more diversity have discernibly better success. Reservoir is proud to be meaningfully differentiated from many of our peer companies for our representation of female employees at every level. As disclosed in our ESG report, which we released last week, almost 40% of senior management at Reservoir identify as female. Moreover, we employ 48% of staff overall who identify as female compared with the national rate of 35.3% and reported in a 2021 study conducted by the USC Annenberg inclusion initiatives. Another key takeaway from our ESG report that I wanted to highlight is our employee retention rate with 100% retention at the senior management level and 87% retention overall in the U.S. last fiscal year. Our experienced team, 43% of which have been working in the music industry for over 16 years, fortified the culture that meaningfully differentiates us from our competitors. That culture and the cohesion of our team allows us to deliver exceptional creative services and value enhancement opportunities across our roster and catalog, resulting in our strong organic growth. As a result, when creators choose to call reservoir their home, they also stay with the company, mirroring our high employee retention rate. If you have not yet, I encourage you to take a look at the ESG report or second since becoming a public company. The principles of ESG have been embedded in our culture since inception, and we understand and care about the influence and impact that our employees and roster of creators have on communities around the world. Shifting to the progress we have made against our business development strategy through the first quarter, I wanted to highlight some of the notable talent and catalogs that have recently joined the company. Just a few of these include: Legendary R&B and Pop Vocal Group, The Spinners. Reservoir acquired the catalogs of 4 of the founding members of the spinners, including master royalty streams for Henry Fambro; and the late Billy Henderson, Purvis Jackson and Bobby Smith. Our team's efficient diligence efforts enabled us to execute this deal across 4 rights holders simultaneously and bring these valuable catalogs to Reservoir. We continue our roster expansion in the Middle East with the catalog acquisition and go-forward joint venture with Saudi Arabian hip-hop label, Masri. This deal was done in conjunction with our partner, Pop Arabia and further builds on our emerging market strategy and boosts our presence in the region. Multi-platinum writer producer, Willie Wilens, signed a new publishing deal with Reservoir for his entire catalog and future works. Willie has collaborated with the likes of M&M, Daddy Yankee, Kendrick Lamar, Dominic [ Psych ] and Killer Mike. He is a massive talent and we couldn't be more excited to work together. Consistent with our strategy and approach, we have more business development opportunities that we look forward to executing and sharing with you in the coming quarters. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter numbers in greater detail. Jim?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Thank you, Golnar, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results in the first fiscal quarter demonstrate the strength of our business model and inherent levers embedded in the business to achieve growth. We are pleased with the strong revenue growth year-over-year for both our segments but we are particularly encouraged by our operating leverage in the quarter. Our OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion is a testament to the operating leverage that is built into our business. Looking ahead, we expect revenue to outpace operating costs as this has generally been the case during our time as a publicly traded company. Turning to our quarterly results. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $31.8 million, a 31% increase versus the prior year quarter. In terms of the components, our top line results in the first quarter were driven by the strong growth in both segments, highlighted by a 37% increase in recorded music year-over-year. Looking at our operating expenses for the quarter. Our overall cost of revenue increased 35% versus the prior year quarter. Our amortization and depreciation costs increased 13% year-over-year due to our continued catalog acquisitions, company administration expenses saw a 20% increase versus the prior year. From an operating performance perspective, in the first quarter, OIBDA increased 38% year-over-year to $9.2 million, while adjusted EBITDA of $10.1 million increased 36% versus the prior year. The increase in OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA was largely driven by strong revenue growth and was partially offset by higher administrative expenses. Interest expense was $4.7 million for the quarter compared to $3 million in the same period last year. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 came in at approximately $165,000 versus $17,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This resulted in diluted earnings per share for the quarter of zero. Lastly, our weighted average diluted outstanding share count during the quarter was $65 million. Turning to our segment breakdown for the quarter. Let's look at Music Publishing first. Music Publishing generated revenue of $20.8 million for the first quarter, which represents a 26% increase from the same period last year due to strong growth in digital and performance revenues. Synchronization revenue in the Publishing segment totaled $3 million, resulting in an 8% decrease from the first quarter of last year. Mechanical revenue within Publishing segment posted a 9% increase year-over-year to $600,000. This strong increase in digital revenue in the Publishing segment was largely driven by the higher CRB 4 headline rate of 15.5% in the first quarter of this year versus the much lower effective rate under CRB 2 from last year. This increased rate is having a material impact on our results for the quarter, but as Golnar mentioned, we expect the year-over-year comparison to be muted in the coming quarters since we started accruing under the affirmed CRB 3 rates in Q2 of the prior fiscal year. Our Recorded Music segment continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter, generating $10.4 million in revenue, representing an increase of 37% versus the prior year quarter. all revenue types within our Recorded Music segment, excluding synchronization, delivered year-over-year increases. Growth in the Recorded Music segment in the first quarter was largely driven by strong physical revenue, which increased 176% versus the prior year. Digital and neighboring rights revenue increased 23% and 25%, respectively. The decline in synchronization within recorded music is really a timing issue as sync licenses are not uniform from one quarter to the next. Let's move on to our balance sheet. At the quarter end, our credit facility was at roughly $331.8 million. we closed the quarter with total liquidity of $130.5 million, comprised of $12.3 million of cash on hand and $118.2 million available under our revolver, which gives us the capital to fund our strategic objectives. In terms of total debt, we ended the quarter at $325.8 million, which was net of $6 million of deferred financing costs, and thus, we maintained $313.5 million of net debt. That compares to net debt of $296.6 million as of March 31, 2023. Lastly, I'll note that almost half of our outstanding debt is hedged at a very attractive interest rate, which will limit our exposure to rising interest rates in the coming year. Let's shift gears to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We are maintaining our previously stated revenue guidance range of $127 million to $132 million, which represents a 6% increase versus fiscal 2023 at the midpoint. We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $49 million to $52 million, which implies 9% growth at the midpoint. I want to note that we continue to make progress on mitigating the cyclicality from our semiannual payments in fiscal 2024. I would also note that our quarterly spread of revenue relative to the prior year may be affected by the CRB 3 accrual that we made in Q2 of fiscal 2023, whereas we don't expect to make any true-up for the final resolution of that retroactive adjustment until Q4 of 2024 at the earliest. Throughout fiscal 2024, we will continue to execute upon margin accretive deals while staying prudent with our capital deployment strategy. Our financial profile remains strong, and our business continues to deliver highly predictable cash flows. We have a clear plan to achieve our provided top line and profitability guidance ranges with room for potential tightening as we progress through the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress at the end of the first half of fiscal 2024. With that, I'll now pass the call back to Golnar.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, Jim. As you can see from our first quarter results, we are progressing nicely toward our financial targets for the fiscal year. We have expanded and enhanced our roster, which continues to add both scale and diversification and will ultimately insulate our business to perform well through market cycles. Demand trends we are seeing across streaming platforms for the consumption of music digitally remains encouraging, and we are well positioned to continue to benefit. As we look toward the remainder of fiscal 2024, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which will drive not only top line growth but also margin expansion. We are excited for the future Reservoir. We appreciate your continued support, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress with you. With that, we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Fuhrman from Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nAlex Fuhrman: It looks like a really strong flow-through to earnings that we saw in the first quarter. Strong, strong performance across the board. Anything in particular that's really been helping to drive the margin performance? And then as we look out over the next couple of years, can you talk about how some of the price increases that we're starting to see from streaming services, how that could impact your revenue and your margins looking out over the next few years?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Sure. Alex, it's Jim. So with respect to the flow through to our adjusted EBITDA margin, the expansion that we're seeing there, that's something that we anticipated. We have over the last couple of years, talked about the operating leverage that is present in our business. it's been a little bit hard to see in the past couple of years as we've had public company costs in one period, not in the prior year period that's being compared. So I think that as we move forward and as we see in this quarter, we expect that margin expansion and we expect to continue to see that margin expansion as we move forward. With respect to the second part of your question around the price increases, we are certainly encouraged by the latest announcement from Spotify. We had the price increase from Apple last year, Amazon earlier this year. And all of those price increases really will impact our revenue on a pretty linear basis. In other words, a 10% price increase at a streaming service will flow through to us at around 10% increase to our pool of that money, and we are encouraged by that and looking forward to it starting to flow through our revenue in the coming months and quarters with respect to Spotify.\nAlex Fuhrman: Great. That's really helpful. And then just more broadly in terms of emerging market. Looks like another investment here in the quarter in the Middle East, where you already have a pretty meaningful presence. Do you see a lot of continued opportunity for M&A in the Middle East and emerging markets more broadly? And when could emerging markets really start to more significantly drive earnings growth?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Alex, this is Golnar. We consistently see opportunities in the Middle East. We have a pretty healthy pipeline of deals to do there, and I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. So I would say that, that's really -- the deal pipeline there is as robust as the sort of macro deal pipeline that we have. I think that we're certainly a few quarters out, if not more, to see meaningful results there as far as our own numbers go. But this is all investments based on anticipated future growth that really will mirror other emerging markets as we have seen happen in the past. So being a content owner and well positioned to take advantage of this growth is the strategy that we have deployed and one that we believe will materialize positively.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Richard Baldry from ROTH.\nRichard Baldry: I wanted to have to dig a little bit more into seasonality because Q1 was far above where we would have expected results to be and you're holding guidance intact. So -- and I understand tougher comparisons, but we look back historically, there's been more true-ups to accruals in Q2, Q4 that tend to seasonally strengthen them pretty meaningfully from Q1 trees. Is anything changing in there that does smooth that out that leaves you holding here? Or do you think you're just being incrementally conservative at the start of the year?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Sure. How are you doing, Rich? So I would say that with respect to our cyclicality of earnings. We've touched on this in our last few earnings calls about how we have been refining our accruals to have the effect of smoothing those earnings a little bit so that the spikes that you mentioned in Q2 and Q4 are not as significant and the valleys in Q1 and Q3 are not as low. I think that what we're seeing now in the first quarter is the result of a lot of those improvements that we have made in that process. We still expect to see bumps in Q2 and Q4 as we true up those accruals to those significant semiannual payments that come in, in the September and March period. But I think that with respect to a very strong Q1 and the fact that we are holding guidance where we previously announced, that's really reflective of our view of being a bit conservative, wanting to see where the first half of the year falls out before we really revisit guidance for the year. We're thrilled with our results in Q1, and we kind of look forward to to updating everyone further and revisiting guidance when we get to our September quarter.\nRichard Baldry: And to the extent -- you've seen any changes on the funding environment with your adjusted EBITDA scaling past our expectations already. Do you still feel good about the availability of incremental credit you were hearing in the broader market, of course, some of the banks are pulling back on on what they're willing to lend. In terms of your own relationships, do you have any concerns there? Or still feel that your executions keeping people willing to sit at the table and increase your availabilities?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yes. We're very comfortable with where we are with our credit facility. We have very strong relationships with all of the banks in our syndicate, especially through us to lease that syndicate. They have been -- the entire group has been very supportive of us, and we don't have any reason to believe that won't continue. And having said all of that, we're also in a very good position with respect to our current facility and availability that we have under that facility even without any further expansion of it at this point. So we feel very good about where we are with respect to our access to capital.\nRichard Baldry: Maybe tie on to that. How do you feel about the M&A pipeline overall to? I think you asked this every quarter, but with things getting macro, looking like it's getting a little darker out there, have you seen any changes in people's expectations, the amount of deals in the pipeline that you're able to look at? Just any color around that?\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Sure. It's been pretty consistent. I'd say we have about a $2 billion pipeline, which is give or take around where we have been in the past quarters that we've reported. We are not really seeing contraction on pricing, and I think that's just because there are high-quality assets in the market with pretty compelling data around future growth and a lot of capital. And so that's not really helping reduce prices significantly. We continue to execute on a lot of off-market transactions as we have in the past, and our relationship certainly help us do that, but we are -- we continue to see very robust deal flow. So that's a good position to be in.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Dan Day with B. Riley Securities.\nDan Day: Questions. Just to go back to the impressive growth on the digital music publishing revenue. I appreciate impacts with the step-up from CRB to 4. the y I understand that. I think I understand the price hikes for the DSPs. Just anything outside of the DSDs, some of these kind of emerging digital channels that are starting to be material or making an impact on growth yet? Or is that still kind of future upside you're thinking about?\nJim Heindlmeyer: Well, I think that we have a number of other partners on the digital front that arengful. I mean that includes Peloton, it includes YouTube, there's a number of partners that we have there and we continue to see strong results from all of them. we're encouraged by those relationships that we have. And our digital licensing team is always looking at new opportunities there as well. I can't say that there's a particular kind of new entrant in the last quarter that was meaningful, but we see strong results across the board from all of our existing partners.\nAlex Fuhrman: The zinc side. I know a lot of it is related to kind of use copy rates and films. So just any issues with the pipeline there with the writers and access rates or riding sale-making for the next couple of quarters to help line for -- so we're not.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: We're not seeing that impact yet. The strike effect film production and the associated music licensing that goes hand-in-hand with that. We don't have an estimate yet on that impact. We're not in a position to really have a view on when the strike will end. What we do know is that the advertising placement business right now remains strong, and we're able to pivot our team to mine those relationships as well as expanding our reach into other areas. The trailer business continues to remain strong, but it's certainly something that we have our eye on and depending on it when the strike and the impact will vary based on that.\nAlex Fuhrman: Me, just any -- is there a hard target you have that maybe you wouldn't want to exceed on that net debt to EBITDA, whether it's on a trailing basis on an expected forward basis. I mean, you're over 6 tons on a trailing basis, which is unreasonable for a business of the study, but just wondering how high you'd be willing to ratchet up that, like that.\nJim Heindlmeyer: Yes. It's an area where we are very focused. We we'll actively look to manage that leverage ratio even though it's not part of our debt covenant any longer. It's an important metric that we look at for the business. And it's something that we will continue to manage. We are aware that while kind of a 6x leverage ratio may not be an uncomfortable place for us to be given our recurring cash flows are the highly predictable cash flows that we have in our business. We are well aware of the perception in the public market of a leverage ratio that's at that level. And it's something that we will continue to manage as we move forward.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Golnar for closing remarks.\nGolnar Khosrowshahi: Thank you, operator. Our performance in the first quarter is indicative of both the strength of our team at reservoir and the quality of the assets that we have assembled. Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
