I would like to welcome you to Canopy Growth's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.  I will now turn the call over to Sarah Pare, Vice President investor relations. Sarah, you may begin the conference call.\nSarah Pare : Thank you, Joanna. Good morning. And thank you for joining us. On our call today, we have Canopy Growth's Chief Executive Officer, David Klein; and Chief Financial Officer Judy Hong.  Before financial markets open today, Canopy Growth issued a news release announcing the financial results for our third quarter ended December 31, 2023. News release and financial statements have been filed on EDGAR, SEDAR and will be available on our website under the investors tab.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements, that are based on management's current views and assumptions. And that this discussion is qualified in its entirety by the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, included at the end of the news release issued today.  Please review today's earnings release and Canopy's reports filed with the SEC on the Canadian Securities Regulators for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. In addition, reconciliations between any non-GAAP measures to their closest reported GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. Please note that all financial information is provided in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. Following remarks by David and Judy, we will conduct a question answer session where we will take questions from analysts.  And with that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Klein : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to review Canopy Growth's third quarter fiscal '24 results. Completion of our Q3, marks the dawn of a new era for Canopy, we’re immensely proud of where we are today and feel strongly that Canopy is positioned for lasting leadership. We're 100% cannabis focused for demonstrating consistent growth across each of our business units. And we have a definitive meeting date scheduled for our shareholders to consider an amendment to our articles to create a new class of non-voting non-participating exchangeable shares, which we expect to advance the Canopy USA structure.  Let's now review our right sized cannabis focused business. With the divestiture of this works in December 2023, our last non-aligned enterprise Canopy -- Canopy is now 100% cannabis focused and purpose built for the markets of greatest opportunity. By focusing exclusively on cannabis and right sizing our footprint, we strengthen our path to delivering sustainable operating profit, and ensure we are well positioned to capitalize on what we feel is the greatest consumer trend of our lifestyle. And while we're looking to the future with optimism, let's first review the dramatic and measurable improvements in the performance of our business that these actions have produced.  To summarize, we've cut Canopy to size and are now delivering on improved gross margins, enhanced commercial execution, and are focused on demonstrating growth across all of our business units. This has enabled us to significantly improve our overall gross margins, with Q3 marking the second quarter in a row of margins in the mid-30s at the total company level. From this strength in base, we're generating growth backed by enhanced execution and consistent high quality products.  In Q3, our Canadian cannabis business delivered its fourth straight quarter of revenue growth. And it's up 10% year-over-year when excluding the divestiture of our retail business. There are several contributors to this growth, but at the core, we're continuing to deliver a great flower and it's been very well received by provincial cannabis boards, retailers, and most importantly consumers, not to mention our staff. This is further validated by growth in our distribution, with an incremental 900 points added nationally during the third quarter. Thanks to the quality of our flower offerings.  I really can't overstate how proud we are of our flower in demand for our high quality strange – strains, such as Tweeds, Kush Mintz, and Tiger Cake remain at an all-time high, and has a selling every gram we can produce. When it comes to flower, we feel that our platform is now dialed in. And then we've got a pipeline of high quality cultivars in market and soon to come from both Tweed and 7ACRES. And to meet the ongoing high demand for our flower, we're also working on ways to further increase yield from our production platform.  We've also developed a robust new product introduction cycle to win market share across priority categories, including pre-rolls, vapes and soft gels. In pre-rolls, we're going to continue our record of success by launching new large packs, infused pre-rolls and burners over the coming months.  In addition, we have an exciting lineup of Tweed and 7ACRES vape products coming to market with differentiated flavor profiles, and we expect to truly delight consumers as we step firmly back into the vape category. Dripping the soft gels, an area of historic expertise at Canopy, we see significant potential to win share through recently launched and soon to come soft gel products, featuring larger pack sizes and unique cannabinoid ratios.  In addition to being a high margin category, soft gels provide consumers a discreet, convenient and affordable method of precisely dosed cannabis consumption. And we feel Canopy is well positioned to achieve categorical leadership. Finally, as the foundation of our edibles portfolio we relaunched Wana in the third quarter across Canada, with very active retailer engagement. We also expect to drive additional growth through the introduction of new Wana products that addresses specific gaps in the current Canadian edibles market.  Shifting to our Canadian medical business. It’s an important margin enhancing pillar of our Canadian strategy. We're especially proud of our medical team as they continue to drive ongoing assortment expansion in the spectrum store, including a wide range of exclusive products all backed by exceptional patient service. This strategy has led to record revenues on a daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly basis, including in the third quarter. And importantly, these record revenues were achieved while improving margins.  Sticking with medical, but shifting to our rest of world cannabis business, we reported another strong quarter with revenues doubling year-over-year. Our Australian team delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of record revenue. Additionally, shipments of proven Canadian strains, including Kush Mintz, Tiger Cake and OG Delux, as well as increased educational training with medical practitioners contributed to growth in our Australia, Polish and Czech medical cannabis sales in Q3.  Finally, we think there's a ton of growth possible across international markets where we're already active and expect consistency of our flower supply, and the onboarding of new distribution partners will continue paying dividends across our international medical cannabis business.  I'm pleased to report that STORZ & BICKEL also delivered a strong third quarter driven by demand for the new VENTY portable vaporizer, as well as the most successful Black Friday in the company's 20-year history, generating sales across STORZ & BICKEL entire portfolio. In fact, the promotional week showcased a remarkable 55% increase in the number of devices sold versus last year, including driving strong VENTY sales despite the device not being discounted.  Speaking of the VENTY, I really can't say enough about this device. It's the best portable vaporizer experience available. I continue to be amazed by how quickly it heats up. But even more the vapor throughput, which at 20 liters a minute is the closest thing you're going to get to the legendary volcano experience in a portable option. But don't just take it from me, the reviews and consumer demand for this device has exceeded all our expectations, and the VENTY is rapidly claiming its hero status within the portfolio.  In fact, after our initial production run, we've had to add a second shift to further increase capacity and ensure availability matches the consumer demand, which shows no sign of slowing.  Much like the iconic volcano we expect the VENTY will be a central pillar of the STORZ & BICKEL portfolio in the long term. As with the rest of the S&B product lineup, it's important to reinforce that these products are truly premium and command a price point reflecting their quality. In some our commercial businesses are demonstrating momentum and delivering impressive results.  So let's talk about Canopy USA. Simply put, we're moving forward. We're pleased to report that we will be filing our definitive proxy statement on or around February 13. Setting up a special shareholder vote for April 12. Following a successful shareholder vote, Canopy USA will be able to proceed with its anticipated acquisition of Jetty, Wana in Acreage, finding synergies to accelerate growth through a unified multi state operating business.  Looking further to the U.S. and the potential impact of regulatory reform on our strategy, as many of you know in August, the Department of Health and Human Services communicated its recommendation that cannabis be rescheduled to schedule 3. This was a welcome development and we're cautiously optimistic that the DEA will in the near term provide its recommendation and initiate this process.  Moving cannabis to Schedule 3 would be a significant boost for the U.S. assets held by Canopy USA and for Canopy growth. Through the removal of Section 280, we expect value appreciation across our U.S. assets, which would see a significant financial boost through reduced corporate income taxes, improve cash flows and strengthen balance sheets.  We also believe cannabis being moved to Schedule 3 would build momentum behind other efforts to reform cannabis regulations in the US. And while we continue to advocate for these high potential catalysts, we remain focused on operating our business and demonstrating growth today. We are a company with a resolute focus on cannabis, attractive gross margins, lower operating expenses, a growing top line and a significantly stronger balance sheet. Canopy USA is moving forward and we look forward to a successful shareholder vote on April 12.  In summary, we believe canopy offers shareholders a unique opportunity to gain exposure to arguably the most exciting consumer product trend of our time into the fastest growing cannabis markets in the world.  With that, Judy will speak to further details of our financial results.\nJudy Hong: Thank you very much, David. And good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing our third quarter fiscal '24 results, including the significant year-over-year progress we've continued to make across our P&L this year. I'll then discuss additional actions we've taken to improve our balance sheet and cash flow all of our priorities and outlook for the balance of fiscal '24. So let's begin with our third quarter results.  Q3, like Q2 before demonstrated a substantial improvement in profitability and cash flow reduction that our right size cannabis focused business can deliver. Canopy delivered consolidated net revenue of $79 million in Q3, which is up 6% compared to Q3 of last year, when excluding Canada retail divestiture. Main drivers of revenue excluding retail divestitures, were, Canadian cannabis revenue increased 10% compared to a year ago, and were up sequentially from Q2. Rest of world cannabis sales grew by 81% year-over-year in Q3, and STORZ & BICKEL grew its revenue by over 50% compared to the last quarter, driven by the launch of VENTY.  Consolidated gross margins in Q3 was 36%, a significant improvement compared to 6% last year. The biggest driver of improvement was the business transformation initiatives executed in Canada, which have meaningfully reduced Canada operational cost. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $9 million, an improvement of 82% versus last year, and a 25% improvement over the $12 million adjusted EBITDA loss in Q2 of fiscal '24. And free cash flow with an outflow of $34 million, an improvement of $44 million, compared to Q3 of last year, at nearly a 50% improvement versus the last quarter.  I'd like to now review the results by our key businesses in more detail, including progress against our path to profitability. First, Canada, Q3 net revenue was $40 million, the third quarter in a row of sequential quarterly revenue growth. Canadian medical sales continued to grow strongly, increased 11% compared to last year, driven by increased assortment of high quality products, including the introduction of Wana brands that began in August.  Our adult-use B2B business, was up 9% compared to last year, with the revenue growth during the quarter driven mostly by the growth of large pack flower offerings from Tweed, as well as addition of Wana Edibles. Canada gross margin in Q3 was 28% and cash gross margin, adding back non cash depreciation costs and costs was 40%. Similar to the last quarter, the biggest driver of year-over-year improvement is the cost reduction from the Canadian business transformation initiatives.  Our efforts drove reduction in flower costs, direct manufacturing costs and overhead expenses and we continue to see material reduction in excess and obsolete inventory expenses, as we have aggressively right size our inventory. We're also pleased to see our Canadian business on track to achieve mid 30% cash gross margin performance in fiscal 2024.  Rest of the world cannabis sales increased 81% year-over-year. Australia had its 12th consecutive record revenue quarter growing over 32% year-over-year. Poland grew revenue by over 60% and Germany also returned to double digit growth year-over-year year over year, aided impart by improved flower shipments. Rest of world gross margin was 40%, driven by year-over-year improvement and margin performance in our Australian Business due to product mix, as well as slapping negative impacts in non-core markets during the prior year period.  Storz & Bickel revenue of $18 million in Q3 was up 54% sequentially, but down 9% year-over-year. Sales during the quarter benefited sequentially from strong consumer demand for new Venty portable vaporizer that was launched in Q3. Initial demand for Venty exceeded production, those sales were constraints early in the quarter as we added a second production shift to better align production with demand.  Black Friday period sales for the Storz & Bickel brand were very strong, resulting in the brand's most successful Black Friday sales, campaign ever in its history. Sales on a year-over-year basis were impacted by reduced shipments to the U.S., due to continuous financial challenges faced by distributors. Storz & Bickel gross margin was 51% compared to 45% last year, in part due to lower input costs and a positive mix shift with Venty, carrying higher gross margin than the rest of the portfolio.  With the divestiture of this works on December 18, 2023, we included revenue for this work sales between October 1, 2023 and December 17, 2023. As a result, we reported, This Works revenue of $8 million in Q3, essentially flat compared to the prior year, which included the full quarter of revenue. These three fiscal '24 adjusted EBITDA was a negative $9 million, an improvement of $42 million compared to a loss of $50 million a year ago.  I would note that this is our best adjusted EBITDA quarter since fiscal 2017. The improvement is driven primarily by additional cost reduction of $36 million realized during Q3 as well as focused execution driving profitable growth across our businesses.  Now, looking at our SG&A expenses more closely, selling and marketing G&A and R&D expenses declined by a combined $26 million or 38% compared to a year ago, as a result of our cost reduction program. Through the strategic transformation initiatives announced in April '22 and February 2023, Canopy has now realized $262 million of cumulative cost reductions, well in our way to achieve our targeted cost savings of $270 million to $300 million. Our cost discipline, along with the expectation for continued growth in our businesses, give us confidence in our target of achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in all of our business units exiting fiscal '24.  I'd like to now review our cash flow and balance sheet. Free cash flow with an outflow of $34 million in Q3, which includes $21 million in cash interest payments, and a $1 million in CapEx. In Q3, we further deliver the balance sheet, reducing an aggregate principal amount by $65 million for a cash payment of $63 million, with the proceeds from the asset sale, including the proceeds from the Bio Steel assets completed during Q3.  In January, we also completed a USD $35 million private placement, majority of which we expect to use towards additional debt reduction.  Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, we had $186 million in cash and short term investments and total debt of $612 million, resulting in net debt balance of $426 million. Following the series of balance sheet actions, we've completed over the past year, we have significantly strengthened our financial position.  First, while the short term…  [Technical Difficulty]  …this mostly relates to the promissory note with Constellation brands. We expect this note to be settled in equity, those preserving cash on our balance sheet. Within our long term debt balance, our senior secured term loan now stands at USD $383 million and is due in March of 2026. This is a reduction of USD $367 million from the original loan amount.  We have been focused on executing additional activities to further deliver on our commitment to improve our financial position over the coming months. And reflecting these factors, we expect our total debt to be around $520 million at the end of fiscal '24 with minimal short term obligation. I'd like to now provide our key priorities and outlook for the balance of fiscal '24 and into fiscal '25. In Canada cannabis, we remain firmly in a path to achieving profitability and are focused on accelerating top line growth on the back of strengthen product portfolio as we close our fiscal '24 and enter fiscal '25. In rest of world cannabis, we expect to see growth in our key priority markets of Australia, Germany, Poland and Czech Republic and we remain focus in ensuring consistent supply of high quality products, as well as launching new products into these markets in the near term.  For Storz & Bickel, with production of the new Venty portable vaporizer, having ramped up during Q3, we expect to see strong Venty demand to offset the seasonally softer sales that we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. S&B Australia sales will also see some impact on the upcoming regulation changes on vapes.  From a cash flow standpoint, we expect our cash from operations to continue to show year- over-year improvement driven by further reduction and adjusted EBITDA loss of lower interest expenses. In closing, we believe our Q3 results reinforce our confidence, but we now have a solid foundation in place to achieve profitability and drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value over time.  This concludes my prepared comments, will now take questions from analysts\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler, please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. And congrats on a lot of the progress you just laid out. We'd love to just get a little bit of better market color on the pricing environment in Canada. And just some of the ways you're managing that and how that outlook looks?\nDavid Klein: Yes. So I think Michael, there's still price compression in some of the categories. And the way we're really managing and I think is making sure that we're thinking about pricing almost from a tiered standpoint. So there are some areas where we need to be price competitive, because the market is taking us there. And then there are some areas where, where we can't produce enough product to meet consumer demand. And so we've actually had some instances where we take price increases. So it really is kind of managing the mix across the portfolio. But, yes, there's still some pressure in the marketplace.\nJudy Hong: I'd also say despite the price compression. And obviously, we are also seeing that in our P&L to some extent, but we're definitely seeing gross margin improvement, in part because we're shifting our mix. So product categories where it's more profitable, we're really leaning in there with better margins. And also we're looking at ways of continuing to save -- find savings from our costs. So our cultivation costs are down year-over-year, but we're looking to even improve our costs more. So as we're seeing some of that price compression, we can more than offset that and see the variable margins improvements across our portfolio.  And then I think, lastly, our medical business, as you know, is that a very high margin business to begin with. And we're also actually seeing margin improvement in that part of the business with some of the product mix improvements that we're seeing in that platform as well.\nMichael Lavery: That's helpful. And where you've been able to take price, can you give a sense of the magnitude? I'd imagine it's relatively modest, but maybe I'm wrong?\nDavid Klein: It's really just, yes it's really just, Michael, it's aligning kind of the, with the competitive set and with kind of consumer expectations. And so there, I guess I was so hard to come up with a specific example. But if you look at, say our Wana offerings, we're going to be very competitive with our classics from a pricing standpoint. But as we bring innovation to market, like our quick formulation, we make sure that we're pricing that at a premium. So really it's, it’s almost on SKU by SKU basis.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tamy Chen at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead\nDavid Klein: Hi, Tamy.\nJudy Hong: Tamy, are you on mute?\nTamy Chen: Sorry about that. Hi, good morning. This is Tamy Chen. \nJudy Hong: Good morning. \nTamy Chen: Yes, good morning. I hit the wrong button. Thanks for taking my question. So as we know, yesterday, one of your competitors acquired their Australian Medical business. And you pointed out in your prepared remarks that the rest of the world gross margin was really primarily driven by the Australian gross margin there. And we noticed that in Q3 this quarter, the margin really jumped versus the previous two quarters, so it was 30ish percent, and now this quarter was 40%. So we really want to dig into maybe the puts and takes in that gross margin number. And also, what are your plans that you want to share with us about Australia that can talk about the attractiveness of that market for you? Thank you.\nJudy Hong: Sure, I'll start, Tamy. So if you looked at our rest of the world business, I would point out a few things. One, historically, you're right, that there's a lot of lumpiness in the gross margin performance, and they're mostly driven by non-core markets. Frankly, I think, you know, we include our U.S. CBD business in that line item. And we've really tightened our focus and went through some strategic changes in our U.S. CBD business and the changes there have impacted the gross margins, as well as the revenue in some of the quarters. We also have historically had a bulk shipment to some of the markets outside North America and that also created volatility in the gross margin performance as well.  So I think when you look at Q3 performance, I'd say it's relatively a clean order and engaging on gross margin performance. We are looking at Australia on a year-over-year basis being improved margin performance as their product mix is improving. But even in Europe, we are also seeing the margin improvement there as well.  The one thing to call out from an Australian business standpoint, in our Australian business, we also have Storz & Bickel sales that go through just from a reported segments standpoint, to the Australia sales as part of the rest of the world sales, and that Storz & Bickel business, frankly, has really grown strongly in Australia. So I think the combination of really strong growth in the flower business in Australia, as well as growing business in Storz & Bickel. But now the improvement we're seeing in markets like Germany, give us confidence that the margins that we're seeing today should be sustainable going forward.\nTamy Chen: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Aaron Grey at Alliance Global Partners. Please go ahead.\nAaron Grey : Thank you very much for the questions. First question for me, we can certainly appreciate the ongoing situation back and forth between the SEC and the exchanges regarding Canopy USA. So just wanted to clarify just in terms of some of the disclosures in the MD&A, it seems like some of your combos with the OCA from the SEC that you expect with the new agreement that they'll didn't agree with the deconsolidation of Canopy USA. So first, can you just clarify that you believe with the filing in February, you will be able to get more clarity on that before the vote in April? And then second, could you provide any additional color in terms of the level potential supplemental information like to provide in terms of how the company would look with Canopy USA on a pro forma basis, even if it's not going to be consolidated. Thank you.\nDavid Klein: So, as we indicated in our remarks, we’ll be filing our definitive proxy this week and all of the information that you could want to know will be available in that. And we will be filing financial statements once we close for Canopy USA, even though as you said it won't be consolidated into our financial results. So, our investors will see the entire picture in those financial statements.  I also want to make sure that whenever we talk about Canopy USA that we're talking about the benefit of Canopy USA. So, I know there's just a lot of interest in terms of how we will structure that business. But for me, the benefit is really having some really strong brands combined with capabilities in some really big markets to create a real focused brand led sort of business in the U.S. which is an extremely attractive and profitable cannabis market.\nJudy Hong: The only thing I would also just that is, even though Canada people will not be consolidating the interest in Canopy USA, I think you know that Canopy growth will own a significant financial interest in Canopy USA. So really the benefits of Canopy USA creating value by owning an operating platform once they're able to exercise the options and trigger on owning one Acreage, the value creation at Canopy USA, we think it’s really an attractive proposition for Canopy growth shareholders as well.\nAaron Grey: Thanks for that color. Appreciate that. And definitely look forward to talking more about the performance of the business versus the optics of how it's disclosed on the financials.  Quick second one for me, if I could. Just in terms of the guidance to you know, reach even a profitability as you exit the fiscal year, just if you could help us maybe triangulate some of the drivers to reach an EBITDA profitability as you exit the year. You'd invest into This Works business that had healthy gross margins, but not sure if it was a drag at the EBITDA level. And other notable drivers talked about the cost savings, you've now had $262 million cumulative versus I believe, $227 million last quarter. So, just if you could help us foot, you know, how you're reaching that in terms of potential gross margin, or SG&A savings and start to actually flow through the P&L and help us reset. I think that'd be very helpful there. Thank you.\nJudy Hong: Sure. So, I'd say there are few levers. One is, I think we do have some remaining cost savings that are left in the program, we remain confident that we'll fully execute and generate those savings in the coming months. The second driver is look, I think our businesses are now really delivering profitable growth.  So as top line grows, and gross margin improves, even with our base businesses, even without some of the cost reductions that we've announced previously, we now have a right sized cost structure that those top line revenues should really drive a stronger EBITDA growth going forward. So I say that's, that's the second driver is really the strong base business growth that we continue to expect to be sustained on a go forward basis.  And then lastly, we are looking at continued efficiencies across our Austin, particularly looking at some of the G&A on the corporate cost side. So we do think that there's opportunities to continue to streamline our corporate costs to make sure that we are looking at really a positive adjusted EBITDA on a going forward basis for all of our business units. We're still finalizing our fiscal '25 plan. So we'll provide more details on the profitability outlook for fiscal '25, as we report our Q4 results in May.\nAaron Grey: Okay, great, thanks for the detail. That's really helpful. I'll go and jump back into the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Zamparo from CIBC. Please go ahead.\nJohn Zamparo : Good morning. I wanted to ask about STORZ & BICKEL. And I appreciate the sequential improvements. Sounds like you're very excited about this business and new products that are coming out. But the revenue was down 8% year-over-year, presumably that's with some pricing embedded into it. And that included a product launch. So I'm just wondering if you could add some color on that business and provide some framework on what you expect from it in calendar '24.\nDavid Klein: Yes, so John. Like this just kind of set the stage want to point out that Storz & Bickel has doubled in the past four years, doubled at the top line level. So, we're seeing reasonably consistent growth across the business. I would say that our results in Q3 were held back a little bit, by the late launch of VENTY, which happened late in the quarter. And so there was a fair amount of production activity and programming activity around the VENTY launch. And we exited the quarter with a substantial backlog of units, which we're working our way through right now.  So, over its history, we see growth coming from STORZ & BICKEL from new product launches, like the VENTY launch. And we've also seen growth from STORZ & BICKEL as a result of distribution growth. And as you know, the U.S., China distribution tier, it has been under duress for the last couple of years that meaning the tier that takes products into vape shops across the United States. And that's caused us some, some pain over time. But we think that we can get back into distribution growth in the U.S in the near future. And then combined with the launch of the Venty and some potential future innovation, we think the prospects are very bright for that brand.  I’ll also point out that when we launch a brand, like Venty, that is margin expanding, because we set up the new launches, so that it improves the overall mix. \nJudy Hong: Yes, and to add to David's point, just on margins, even though revenue was down year-over-year, gross profit dollars were actually up year-over-year. So, I think that continues to show the evidence that we're really leaning in a profitable growth. And I think even Storz & Bickel, and you're seeing that profitable growth really come through with gross profits dollar up on a year-over-year basis.\nJohn Zamparo: All right, that's helpful. Thanks. And then I wanted to follow up on Aaron's question about profitability plans and cost savings. And I guess you answered it, but just to clarify you, it sounds like you expect both sales growth and additional cost cuts. But do you think you can get to positive EBITDA on a consolidated basis? In the event you don't achieve the sales growth you want, do you have confidence you can get to the high end of your cost savings plan? And would that require additional actions? If that was the case? Or are those actions already taken? And you're just waiting for these additional costs through flow to the P&L?\nJudy Hong: Yes, look, I mean, John, I'd say our businesses have now a strong foundation for profitability. I think there's evidence that from a gross margin standpoint, you're seeing improvement, not just from a cost reduction perspective, but the growth and your mix improvement that's also driving profitability improvements. And that's not just in Canada, but you see that in rest of the world and Storz & Bickel businesses as well.  It's a one area is we are a public company costs. So there are costs that are just related to being a public company costs, and we're actively and then we've already identified some of the opportunities and areas of cost savings there. And that will be continued to be an area where we'll focus on as we really drive towards that profitability targets. But as we said, in our prepared comments, we do believe that we will exit fiscal '24 with all of our business units in profitable. So, we're really pleased with the performance so far.\nJohn Zamparo: Okay, understood. Thanks very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Question comes from Bill Kirk from Roth MKM. Please go ahead. \nBill Kirk: Hey, thanks for the questions. I want to go back to some that you just said, Judy, just for clarification. So all business units adjusted EBITDA profitable. Does that mean consolidated, profitable or their unallocated expenses, maybe at the corporate level that would make consolidated EBITDA negative even if all business units were EBITDA positive?\nJudy Hong: So, Bill, we don't break out segment information at the adjusted EBITDA level. So all I can say is we are not this year, our goal is to be profitable at the consolidated level. As I said we feel that we are on track to achieve profitability at the business unit level, exiting FY '24. Does that mean the full quarter is profitable? Does that mean, is it consolidated adjusted EBITDA is profitable, there's still some areas that we just need to see how that plays out.  I would also point out, there's some lumpiness in some of those corporate costs that sometimes sits on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So those are all the things that they were really focused on mitigating. And I think I would just say, in my view, the performance of the business is very encouraging in terms of the top and bottom line growth. And obviously, we’re focused on generating positive adjusted EBITDA across all of our businesses as we exit fiscal 2024.\nBill Kirk: And, I mean, I think to your point, that's the best adjusted gross margin since Canadian legalization, I think. And so I guess what was the big surprise when you guided 3Q, or when you talked a couple of months ago, about 3Q, you said you expected gross margins to be -- adjusted gross margins to be in the mid20s. So what was new from when you when you had that expectation? I mean, imagine some of the cost saving stuff was notable a few months ago about 3Q. So what's really new from mid20s to 36?\nJudy Hong: So, Q2, I think our gross margin in Canadian business was in the mid-30s, this quarter reported gross margins are 28%.\nBill Kirk: Sorry, when you add 2Q, you guided 3Q gross margins to the mid20s, if I remember correctly, right? So when you were last reported, you said 3Q?\nJudy Hong: Yes, so the Canada gross margins were 28%. The consolidated gross margin, which was in the mid-30%, is based on Storz & Bickel margin probably did come in a bit better than we expected, partly driven by obviously, the Venty and then some of the benefits from lower material costs as well.  And I'd say even Canadian margin probably came in a bit better than we expected. I think I did call that last quarter where we'd say we had some benefits from opportunistic use of lower cost inputs. We had some of that lingering benefit in Q3, so that helped Q3 gross margin performance in the Canadian business, a little bit better than we anticipated at that point in time as well.\nBill Kirk: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Bottomley, from Canaccord, please go ahead.\nMatt Bottomley : Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to get a little more commentary, if you can provide your overall outlook on sort of your Canadian domestic operations, clearly, we've seen a bit of softness to end the year, at least at the retail levels in Canada, and the overall medical opportunity seems to be flat to declining. So I know you saw some decent year-over-year growth this year for extend the quarter. But I'm just curious if you can give a 12-month outlook as to how notable if at all the domestic operations will be as a growth driver for the company?\nDavid Klein: I think we believe that with the gross margins, we're now delivering, our area of focus now is on how to drive growth, right. And so for us, I think it just continuing to build on what we've done to date in terms of the strains we have in the market, in terms of some NPD that we have on the verge of bringing into the market. In particular, as I said in my script building on some of the momentum we've had in pre-rolls, leading into soft gels a little bit and then coming back into the vapes space more aggressively than we've been in the past.  We also think that there's a lot of distribution opportunity for our brands across the marketplace. So I think that it's more around the lines of having good margin products that are resonating with consumers and executing in all aspects of our go-to-market strategy. That's how we see ourselves continuing to grow in Canada, in particular, addressing the adult-use sector.\nJudy Hong: And on the medical side, I'd say the market has been declining, but we've been growing and gaining market share in the medical market. So from that respect, we think that there's continued opportunity to grow our medical business, a lot of the growth is actually coming from increased basket sizes. So we actually are seeing patients order more products on our platform. And I think that's a function of an increased product assortment that we have now in our spectrum store. And so we would continue to see that driving new portion in our medical platform.\nMatt Bottomley : Got it. Thanks. And then just one more for me, now switching just on to the international side of things. So there's been a lot of constructive commentary with respect to the outlook in certain markets in the EU, I know Australia has been mentioned and someone referenced the deal that was mentioned yesterday, even one of the U.S., MSOs has been pretty constructive on the international side of things. So just considering that on a trailing 12-month basis, there's been a lot of focus on sort of the balance sheet and there's been some asset dispositions, do you think there's an ability or need to deploy any capital into some of these markets in advance of regular changes? Or do you think the, the runway is long enough, so that might not be a primary focus for Canopy in the near term?\nDavid Klein : Yes, Matt, I would say that given our experience of kind of being the first one into markets, I think we'll be very careful with any capital that would get deployed into international markets. What we will however do is really lean into the areas where we are operating and operating well like Australia, like Germany, like Poland, like Czech Republic, by bringing really strong product offerings to market with a very focused team. But I think we would will remain asset light most likely in the international markets and make sure we can we can grow in Canada and focus on the U.S.\nMatt Bottomley : Okay, thanks. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to David Klein for closing comments.\nDavid Klein : Thanks for attending today's conference call. Appreciate the questions. Ramp up as we started, we're singularly focused on cannabis. Our businesses are growing and demonstrating healthy margins and Canopy USA is moving forward. We're proud of where we are as well as where we're going and I feel confident that Canopy offers a real unique option for exposure to the growth of the world's cannabis markets. Our Investor Relation team will be available to answer additional questions. Everyone have a fantastic day.\nOperator: This concludes, Canopy Growth's this third quarter fiscal 2024 financial results conference call. A replay of this conference call will be available until May 9, 2024 and can be accessed following the instructions provided in the company's press release issued earlier today. Thank you for attending today's call."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jovel and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome you to Canopy Growth's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I will now turn the call over to Tyler Burns, Director, Investor Relations. Tyler, you may begin the conference.\nTyler Burns: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On our call today, we have Canopy Growth's Chief Executive Officer, David Klein; and Chief Financial Officer, Judy Hong. After financial market's close today, Canopy Growth issued a news release announcing the financial results for our second quarter ended September 30, 2023. The news release and financial statements have been filed on EDGAR and SEDAR, and will be available on our website under the Investors tab. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions, and that this discussion is qualified in its entirety by the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements included at the end of the news release issued today. Please review today's earnings release, Canopy's reports filed with the SEC and on SEDAR for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. In addition, reconciliations between any non-GAAP measures to their closest reported GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. Please note that all financial information is provided in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated. Following prepared remarks by David and Judy, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will take questions from analysts. To ensure that we get to as many questions as possible, we ask analysts to limit themselves to one question only. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David, please go ahead.\nDavid Klein: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Canopy Growth's second quarter fiscal '24. I'm pleased to speak to the positive results we have reported today, that have been achieved through the successful structural transformation of our business, as well as the actions we have taken to strengthen Canopy's balance sheet. As should be evident, the Canopy of today looks fundamentally different than it did a year ago, and we are proud of the results that this transformation is already delivering. During the call today, I will cover three topics: First, the completed transformation of Canopy to a simplified cannabis-focused, asset-light business now anchored by strong fundamentals; second, at building on this foundation, we are now focused on driving the growth of our core businesses supported by high-quality products that are already resonating with consumers; and finally, I will provide a brief update on our Canopy USA strategy and the continued advancement of this high potential ecosystem. Following my remarks, Judy will provide a review of our second quarter fiscal '24 results, including the actions taken to strengthen our financial position and improve liquidity. Let's begin with the transformation of our business. Through bold and decisive actions, we have delivered on our commitment to transform Canopy Growth into a streamlined, cannabis-focused, asset-light business. To recap the core components of this transformation delivered include: divesting our Canadian retail operations, consolidating our cultivation platform from 12 sites to 2, centered at our purpose-built Kincardine and Kelowna facilities, and successfully moving to an adaptive third-party sourcing model for all cannabis beverages, edibles, vapes and extracts, as well as ceasing the funding of BioSteel, which significantly reduced our cash burn and further simplified our overall business. These actions have resulted in a Canopy that looks and operates fundamentally different than before, a Canopy that is purpose-built for the markets and geographies of greatest opportunity. Today, almost 90% of our revenues come from cannabis or cannabis-adjacent categories. Simply put Canopy is more focused and agile than ever before. And while change is ever present in this sector, it has not always yielded positive outcomes. This is why I am especially pleased to note that our actions have led to a dramatic and measurable improvement in the financial performance of our business. Our Canadian business grew revenue for the third consecutive quarter, while we cut our costs by nearly half and reduced our debt by a $1 billion. We have done the hard work to lay a firm foundation for sustainable growth. Next, I will speak to our efforts to drive profitable growth in our core businesses. Our Canadian business has worked diligently to implement lasting enhancements to the quality of our cannabis flower. We have great flower in the market, and it’s being consistently well received by our consumers, retailers, and the boards. And every day we are finding ways to improve. Our team is passionate about enhancing every step of our cultivation and post harvest processes. And we continue to up our game to meet and exceed consumer expectations. For those who haven't tried our flower lately, I invite you to go out and experience the incredible quality that our teams at Kincardine and Kelowna are delivering. Further demonstrating the positive reception that our products are receiving, Canopy reclaimed its place as a Top 3 flower supplier in the BC cannabis stores during the second quarter of fiscal '24. This performance is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our Canadian team. In addition, having taking control of the distribution of our Wana edibles brand in Canada towards the end of the quarter, we have a robust plan to return to the number one edibles brand in the country. Just this week, we relaunched the brand across Canada and are actively engaging with retailers as well as introducing new formulations that have already been successful in the United States. We have also made Wana gummies available to our registered medical cannabis patients in Canada through spectrumtherapeutics.com to further meet demand for these quality products and drive incremental growth in our Canadian medical platform. In our global medical cannabis business, I am pleased to report that our Australian team has delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of record revenue. In our other international markets, including Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, we believe there is an opportunity for Canopy to grow share, leveraging the quality of the products that our Canadian platform is producing, ensuring consistent supply, advanced routes to market and better consumer engagement. As an example, to capitalize on this opportunity, we are shipping five new flower SKUs, cultivated in our newly EU GMP certified Kincardine facility to international markets during Q3. Finally, Storz & Bickel recently launched its new Venty portable vaporizer, a device that sets industry standards for portable performance, including adjustable airflow up to an industry leading 20 liters per minute and a rapid 20-second heat-up time. Storz & Bickel is now focused on following up the limited initial batch with broader commercial availability to meet the demand for this industry-leading device as well as preparing for holiday promotions, including Black Friday, which are expected to drive sales across the brand's product lineup. Finally, I would like to speak briefly about our Canopy USA strategy. We believe Canopy USA provides investors a truly novel exposure to the continued rapid growth of the U.S. cannabis market. Importantly, this approach is informed by the lessons we have learned in Canada. We have embraced scalability and capital efficiency, which have resulted in our asset-light and wholesale-focused strategy. As we continue to work closely with the SEC to advance this novel structure, we have been in active discussions with the most recent communication, indicating that there is more work to be done to enable us to deconsolidate the financials of Canopy USA. Meanwhile, we remain steadfast in our journey ahead, buoyed by the continued advancement of Wana, Jetty and Acreage, who are demonstrating impressive growth. During the quarter, Wana executed two agreements for new state launches expected in Q1 of calendar '24. Jetty has introduced its award winning vape products in Colorado in coordination with Wana and achieved the number three market share position in the solventless vape cartridge category in the state just three months after launch. Acreage, leveraging their strategy for focusing on high-potential markets like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, remains well-positioned for further unlocks and has debuted its Superflux craft cannabis brand in New Jersey. These advancements are complimented by this week's news that Ohio has voted to legalize cannabis for adult-use. And congratulations to the people of Ohio and to the Acreage team, which is already well-positioned in the state through their retail footprint of five stores. I'd also like to recognize TerrAscend, of which cannot be owned 17%, which reported its financial results today and generated over $82 million in revenue and over $24 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. To summarize, Canopy Growth is streamlined, cannabis focused, and asset light. We have demonstrated our resilience and strengthened our financial position. We’ve laid the foundation for profitable growth across each of our core businesses with a Canopy Growth that is purpose built for the markets and geographies of greatest opportunity. And we stand apart with our unique exposure to the ongoing expansion of the U.S. market through Canopy USA. I am proud of the transformation that this team has delivered, and I am more confident than ever in our ability to achieve North American cannabis leadership. With that, Judy, we'll speak in further detail to our financial results.\nJudy Hong: Thank you very much, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our second quarter fiscal 2024 results, including the significant progress we've made across our P&L this quarter. I'll then discuss additional actions we've taken to delever the balance sheet and improve liquidity, followed by our priorities and outlook for the balance of fiscal ‘24. Let's begin with our second quarter results. Q2 was a pivotal quarter for Canopy as a business transformation we've undertaken over the past year through substantial improvement in profitability and reduction in cash burn. Please note that our financial results in the current period and prior periods now exclude BioSteel results as BioSteel is presented on a standalone basis as a discontinued operation. We delivered consolidated net revenue of $70 million in Q2, which is down 7% compared to Q2 of last year, excluding the Canadian retail divestiture. Main drivers of year-over-year revenue decline were Storz & Bickel, which was negatively impacted by the timing of shipments and U.S. CBD sales, which have undergone a strategic shift over the past year. The Canadian cannabis sales were down slightly excluding retail divestiture compared to a year ago, but up from the prior quarter. Q2 gross margin was 34%, and adjusted gross margin was 33%, a significant improvement compared to negative 1% last year. The biggest driver of improvement was the business transformation initiative executed in Canada, which has meaningfully reduced Canada operational costs. Q2 gross margin also benefited from opportunistic use of certain lower priced inputs in the Canadian business, which may not recur. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $12 million, which was an improvement of over 79% versus last year, and 48% improvement versus last quarter. Free cash flow was an outflow of $67 million, an improvement of $32 million compared to Q2 of last year. I'd like to now review the results of our key businesses in more detail, including the progress against our path to profitability. Starting with Canada. Q2 net revenue was $40 million, a third quarter in a row of sequential revenue increase. The Canadian medical sales continued to show steady growth increasing 6% compared to last year, even as the broader medical market is showing a decline. Our adult-use B2B business was down 6% compared to last year and was broadly in line with Q1. We again saw strong growth from our Tweed, flower and pre-rolled, despite our top selling SKUs being supply constrained due to stronger demand than expected during the quarter. We also had supply challenges in our beverages as our transition to third party contract manufacturers took longer than expected. The beverages are now back in stock and they're better than ever. Canada adjusted gross margin in Q2 was 34% and cash gross margin, adding back non-cash depreciation cost of goods sold was 47%. Let me unpack this gross margin performance. The biggest driver of year over improvement is the cost reduction from the Canadian business transformation initiatives. We had targeted $90 million to $100 million reduction in cost of goods sold as part of these initiatives, and we have achieved approximately $80 million of reduction through Q2 inclusive of savings realized during fiscal 2023. Year-to-date, operational costs in Canada have declined by $37 million in the first half or 47% year-over-year with reduction across all areas, including facility cost, labor, both direct and indirect, utilities, insurance, and distribution costs. In addition, we also saw a significant reduction in excess and obsolete inventory expenses as we right sized our inventory. Finally, our Q2 gross margins benefited from opportunistic utilization of certain lower priced inputs, which may not recur. We continue to target cash gross margins in the mid-30% in our Canadian business, and we believe that we're on track to achieve this margin performance in the second half of the year. Rest of the world's cannabis sales were down 15% year-over-year. Australia, which now accounts for nearly 60% of total rest of the world sales had its 10th consecutive record revenue quarter, growing over 20% year-over-year. This was offset by the decline in our German flower sales in part due to the broader market decline. U.S. CBD sales were also down year-over-year, driven by a shift in focus to e-commerce channel for this business. Rest of the world's gross margin was 30%, reflecting an improvement in our U.S. CBD business post our strategy shift, partially offset by a geographic makeshift to Australia, which carries lower gross margin than Europe. Turning to Storz & Bickel, revenue of $12 million in Q2 was down 11% compared to last year. Note that Q2 is a seasonally soft revenue quarter for Storz & Bickel, sales were further impacted by the timing of shipments to certain U.S. distributors, which fell in October versus September. In addition, some of the distributors in the U.S. continued to face financial difficulties, and as a result, shipments to those distributors have been disrupted. Year-to-date, Storz & Bickel revenue is up 3% with the second half expected to show acceleration, driven in part by the launch of the new vaporizer, Venty. Storz & Bickel gross margin was 33%, down compared to last year, in part due to lower revenue and associated fixed cost deleverage. On a year-to-date basis, gross margin is close to 40%, which is in line with recent trends. This Works grew its sales 3% year-over-year, benefiting from increased contribution from its body care product line. Gross margin remained healthy at 48%. Let me now speak to the progress we're making on our path to profitability. Due to fiscal ‘24 adjusted EBITDA loss was a negative $12 million, an improvement of $44 million compared to a loss of $56 million a year ago. The improvement is driven primarily by cost reduction of $54 million realized during Q2. We also estimate that Q2 adjusted EBITDA benefited by approximately $5 million from a few non-recurring items, including opportunistic use of lower cost inputs, reversal of bad debt expense, and a favorable legal settlement. Looking at our SG&A expenses more closely, selling and marketing, G&A and R&D expenses declined by a combined $32 million or 45% compared to a year ago, as a result of our cost reduction program. Acquisition, divestiture and other costs were $10 million, which included $7 million of costs related to the debt amendment transaction we completed in July. Through the strategic transformation initiatives announced in our April 2022 and February 2023, Canopy has realized $227 million of cumulative cost savings. We are tightening the target range of cost savings program to $270 million to $300 million from our previously target of $240 million to $310 million. We expect the full completion of the cost reduction initiatives to position our businesses to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA exiting fiscal 2024. I would like to now review our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investment balance at September quarter-end was $270 million, which excludes BioSteel's cash. Q2 fiscal '24 cash from continuing operations was an outflow of $67 million, an improvement compared to $99 million in Q2 of fiscal '23. We incurred $28 million of cash interest payments during Q2. Cash from operations also included cash restructuring costs -- cost and facility holding costs, including our Hershey Drive facility, the sale of which we did not close until the end of Q2. In addition, while BioSteel's operating cash flow is not included in this figure, we do note that there are certain cash costs that Canopy has continued to pay for BioSteel during the quarter. We expect our cash flow from our operations to continue to show improvement in the coming quarters, driven by cost reduction initiatives as well as lower interest payments from reduced debt balance. Second, within cash flow from investing activities, Q2 saw an additional inflow of $69 million from disposition of facilities, including the sale of Hershey Drive facility we closed at the end of September. Year-to-date, gross proceeds from facility divestitures have totaled over a $155 million. Net financing activities resulted in an outflow of $274 million. Debt paid down of $297 million comprised of payments to reduce our senior secured term loan at a discount to par, as well as to settle our July 2023 unsecured notes as part of the July debt amendment transaction. The private placement we completed in September resulted in a net cash flow of $32 million. Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2023, we had $270 million in cash and short-term investments and total debt of $681 million, resulting in net debt balance of $411 million, down from $474 million at the end of June of 2023. Following the series of balance sheet actions we’ve completed over the several months, we have significantly strengthened our financial position. First, our short-term debt balance stands at $50 million, most of which relates to the term loan pay-down earmarked from previously disclosed facility disposition. Second, the principal balance on our senior secured term loan is expected to be approximately USD 400 million by the end of the current quarter. This is a reduction of USD 350 million from the original shown amount. We also expect a $100 million of promissory notes held by Constellation to be settled in equity. Reflecting these factors, we expect our total debt to be around $570 million with minimal short-term obligation. We remain focused on executing additional activities to further deliver on our commitment to improve our financial position over the coming months. I'd like to now provide our key priorities and outlook for the balance of fiscal ‘24. In Canada cannabis, we're firmly on a path to achieving profitability and are focused on accelerating top line growth on the back of a strengthened product portfolio. In rest-of-world cannabis, we expect continued growth in Australia and are focused on maximizing sales potential in an emerging medical market, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, while working on improving performance in Germany in the back half of our fiscal ‘24. For Storz & Bickel, we expect growth to accelerate in the back half following the launch of the Venty vaporizer, though the pacing may be a bit lumpy, depending on the timing of a full rollout. This Works sales are expected to be stronger in Q3 versus Q4 as we enter the holiday season. From a cash flow standpoint, we expect our cash from operations to continue to show improvement driven by expected narrowing of adjusted EBITDA loss, lower interest expenses, and our stepped-up focused on working capital management. We're also focused on remaining costs related to shuttered locations and certain contracts we've exited. In closing, we believe that Q2 results demonstrate that we're well underway to achieving our target of positive adjusted EBITDA across our businesses as we exit fiscal 2024, setting a firm foundation for the core businesses to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. This concludes my prepared comments. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners.\nAaron Grey: So now that we get a look at the Company kind of post BioSteel discontinue. Just want to talk a little bit more about the gross margin. Judy, you gave a lot of commentary within there, just want to make sure I have it down correct. So in terms of the gross margin expectations going forward, I think you talked about 35% back half cash gross margins. So I just want to make sure am I thinking about that correctly versus the 34% that you just reported? And you talked about some one-offs in there with some lower cost inputs that benefited you this quarter. So just if you could help us in terms of maybe some of the near term gross margin expectations before you get to what you expect in the back half. Because it sounds like you had some one-offs that also benefited there.\nJudy Hong: Sure. And I'll take that question. So, the target of mid-30%, to be clear, is a cash gross margin in the Canadian business. So, when you actually look at our gross margin performance in Canada in Q2 the reported gross margin was 34%, but you had cash gross margin of about 47%. We did have some favorable benefits that we don't expect to recur in the back half of the year. So, really what we're saying is we're expecting, the target gross margin to be -- cash margin to be around mid 30%. Included in that is depreciation expenses, which is obviously non-cash. That's now running roughly about $4 million to $5 million a quarter. So it is about a 10 percentage-point impact to report gross margin. So, when you think about the Canadian business, I would expect the reported gross margins to be low to mid 20%, cash gross margin to be closer to kind of that mid-30%. When you look at the international or the rest of the world margins, we think that 30% is probably going to see some improvement in the back half as some of the efforts that we're undertaking across our key markets drive better sales in the back half the year. And then Storz & Bickel is the gross margin in Q2 is typically a lower gross margin quarter just because the revenue tends to be lower. So, in the back half, we would expect Storz & Bickel gross margin to be -- to show improvement versus what we have shown in Q2. So I think that should give you a good sense of where we will land from a gross margin standpoint in the back half the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Zamparo with CIBC.\nJohn Zamparo: Thank you. Good evening. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet, and I'm trying to get a sense of how you address the debt from here, because even with the significant reduction, it's still a material amount. So is the plan to capture the economics of the U.S. businesses hopefully at some point in the future? And if so, are those free cash flow positive in a normal taxation environment, or do you plan to raise equity to repay that debt? Thank you.\nJudy Hong: Yes. So, I'll take that, John. So I'd say, first of all, I want to note that we do not have any upcoming maturity until September of 2025. So as you can see, we've undertaken significant actions to eliminate any near-term obligations from a debt perspective. And we have maintained a strong cash position. We have over $270 million of cash on our balance sheet. So, we think we have an ample runway with the cash balance that we have. We also have additional proceeds that we expect to receive from sale of BioSteel, and we'll continue to look to monetize, businesses or patients that are not core to Canopy. Beyond that, we have a very constructive dialogue with our investors both on the debt side and others to ensure that we can reduce our debt in an accretive manner, which also saves our cash interest costs. So there are active, I'd say plans in place to continue to look for ways of reducing our debt over time. And we'll have more update as we have announcements to share.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Could you -- you touched on TerrAscend’s performance on the call, but you -- as you also pointed out in the prepared remarks, your stake there would be like a 17%. Can you just give a sense of the longer-term vision for that? And by keeping it on investors' radar, is the expectation that you would want to consolidate that someday? And if so, how would you anticipate going about that?\nDavid Klein: Yes. Michael, so, we continue to be favorable on the U.S. market. And so, I would say TerrAscend is just one of the assets that we hold in that market. We like the work that's going on at TerrAscend, especially in markets like New Jersey and Maryland. And we continue to have our other companies interact, a lot with TerrAscend. So, for example, TerrAscend distributes Wana in Maryland, and it is working out quite well for both companies. And so, we look at TerrAscend as just one of the pieces to the puzzle for the U.S., along with Wana and Jetty and Acreage. Acreage has interesting positioning, I think, in markets like New York and Ohio and Illinois. And so, we think those are big opportunity markets, as we go forward. So, we just continue to watch the U.S. market very closely. And we remain committed and impressed actually with our U.S. businesses.\nOperator: I will now turn the call over to Mr. Klein for final remarks.\nDavid Klein: Great. Thank you. As you head into the holidays, I want to encourage everyone to add the latest products from Canopy to your gift list, including things like Wana Quick edibles, Tweed flower, or Storz & Bickel vaporizers. I suspect anyone would be very excited to receive those as Christmas gifts. As a reminder, Investor Relations will be available to answer additional questions. Have a good evening, and thank you for attending today's conference call.\nOperator: This concludes Canopy Growth second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results conference call. A replay of this conference call will be available until February 7, 2024 and can be accessed following the instructions provided in the Company's press release issued earlier today.

During the call today, I’ll cover four key topics: First, the progress of our transformation to a simplified asset-light business; Second, the improved performance of our Canadian cannabis business; Third, the strong top line performance for BioSteel and Storz & Bickel; and Finally, a brief update on Canopy USA and the encouraging developments with our U.S. cannabis brands. Following my remarks, Judy will provide a brief review of our first quarter fiscal ‘24 results, and review the actions we’ve taken recently to strengthen our financial position and improve liquidity. Over the past year, we made significant and sweeping changes to our business. Our strategy is anchored in our commitment to building beloved consumer brands within an asset-light operating model. We fundamentally believe this model will enable us to compete more effectively. We’ve streamlined and simplified the business in the following ways. We’ve divested our national retail operations to reduce complexity and eliminate channel conflict. We closed many facilities to focus cultivation into two purpose-built sites. We’ve outsourced production of edibles, vapes, and beverages to contract manufacturers, which is accelerating speed to market, while reducing the overhead and risks involved in developing new products. Collectively, these actions resulted in a roughly 60% reduction in both, our cultivation footprint and total headcount. This transformation to a simplified asset-light model is working, as evidenced by our increased ability to execute and deliver measurable results. Today, our remaining cultivation facilities in concurrent, in Kincardine, Ontario and Kelowna, British Columbia, are producing the high-quality flower that consumers desire. Our cultivation infrastructure has been greatly simplified and our supply is more effectively matched to demand. Our transformation has delivered significant cost savings with SG&A expenses and cost of goods sold reduced by a combined $172 million to date, including $47 million in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24. We continue to expect this transformation to yield $240 million to $310 million in cost savings by the end of fiscal ‘24. While we’re pleased with the significant progress already made, our work to complete the transformation of Canopy Growth is not yet done. Over the next weeks and throughout the remainder of the year, we’ll continue to execute on opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce expenses as we drive our business to adjusted EBITDA positive exiting fiscal ‘24, excluding investments in BioSteel. Next, I’d like to spend a few minutes discussing the performance of our Canadian cannabis business in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24. Our adult-use cannabis business delivered the third straight quarter of stable to growing revenues, increasing 12% sequentially to $24 million. This improved performance is being led by the resurgence of our Tweed brand. In fact, in the first quarter, Tweed Kush Mints 28g was one of the top five performing flower SKUs in Canada. The demand for Tweed is strong across the country, including in the larger markets of British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. As more consumers experience these high-quality strains, the demand has elevated the Tweed brand to the number 8 rank within the total flower segment of the Canadian adult-use cannabis market, moving up 19 places year-over-year. As we look to the year ahead for our Canadian cannabis business, we’ll continue Tweed’s momentum and apply the same winning approach to our Doja and 7ACRES brands. Another exciting development for our Canadian portfolio is the addition of Wana edibles. In late May, we announced that Canopy will now distribute Wana in Canada, unifying our North American house of brands, which is part of our long-term strategy. This is a significant step toward becoming the leader in cannabis edibles in Canada. We’ve developed an ambitious brand growth strategy for Wana early in the current quarter, starting with the availability of Wana gummies for registered medical cannabis patients through Spectrum Therapeutics. We’re already seeing strong demand, reaffirming the brand’s potential within the Canadian market. And we’re also working with the Wana team to deliver more industry-leading innovation to drive the brand’s leadership in the Canadian cannabis market. We expect the addition of Wana to be accretive to revenue and adjusted EBITDA as we cement Canopy as Canada’s leading cannabis edibles company. I’ll now speak to the performance of our consumer products business in the first quarter, starting with BioSteel. BioSteel brand delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenues, increasing 68% sequentially, more than double the prior year. This strong performance by BioSteel in the first quarter was due in part to our continued drive into the food, drug and mass market channel in Canada, ahead of the key summer selling season. For those of you that live in Canada, I’m sure you’ve seen that the BioSteel brand has become ubiquitous and is prominently featured in gas stations, grocery stores, and Costco, nationwide. In the U.S., we’re tightening BioSteel’s geographical focus to prioritize key markets, including the central, northeast, and southeast regions. While the brand continues to deliver record top-line growth, the investments required to sustain this business are significant. As I outlined on our last call, together with our Board, management is actively engaged in a strategic review of the business, including exploring a sale. And we expect to have a decision in short order to reduce the drag on our profitability as we remain focused on our core cannabis businesses. Turning briefly to our world-leading vaporizer, brand Storz & Bickel. Distribution gains in the United States helped grow revenue 16% year-over-year to $18 million in the first quarter. Historically, Storz & Bickel has experienced significant growth following the launch of new products, and I’m excited to share that we’re in final preparations to launch a new line of innovative Storz & Bickel vaporizers this fall, setting the performance standard for cannabis vaporizers. I fully expect this will drive the next era of growth for the Storz & Bickel brand. Finally, I’d like to briefly speak about our U.S. cannabis businesses, which continue to drive brand growth, primarily leveraging an asset-light expansion strategy. Beginning with Jetty this past July, the brand brought California’s number one solventless vape to the state of Colorado, its third U.S. market after launching in New York State this past March. Building on their decade of leadership in the California market, Jetty expanded its product offerings in the state with the launch of the market’s first OCal certified solventless vapes in a variety of Sativa and Indica strains. OCal is a comparable to organic certification for the cannabis industry. Moving on to Wana, in collaboration with Surterra Wellness in Florida, Wana products from the brand’s premium and innovative cannabis infused gummies lineup are now available to patients in 45 medical cannabis treatment centers across the state of Florida, marking the 15th active U.S. state or territory in which Wana cannabis edibles are sold. It’s worthwhile highlighting that in addition to these individual growth strategies, the Canopy USA ecosystem companies continue to develop collaborative opportunities and synergies, including TerrAscend becoming the sole manufacturer, supplier, and commercialization partner of Wana brands in the fast-growing New Jersey market, as well as being Wana’s new partner in Maryland, which is now adult-use legal. Speaking of TerrAscend, I’d like to congratulate them on their transformative TSX listing, which marks the first multi-state operator to successfully trading on a major exchange. We look forward to continuing to support their success in working together to capitalize on the large market opportunity in the U.S. In summary, Canopy’s Q1 earnings demonstrate that our transformation to a simplified asset-light model is already yielding results. Our core cannabis -- our core business, is stabilizing and growing. Our commercial execution has strengthened, and we have delivered significant cost savings that put us on a path to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in our cannabis businesses, exiting fiscal ‘24. And while BioSteel continues to demonstrate record top line growth, our focus remains North American cannabis leadership, and as such, we’re advancing with strategic options to reduce the cash burn associated with BioSteel, as well as exploring additional measures to monetize other non-core assets. Ultimately, we remain convinced by the potential of the $50 billion to $70 billion North American cannabis market, and to meet this opportunity, we’ve transformed Canopy into an asset-light and more focused organization. We’ll have more to share about our additional actions to further cement this transformation over the coming months. With that, I’ll turn it over to Judy.\nJudy Hong: Thank you very much, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start by recapping our first quarter fiscal 2024 results, including the progress we’re making to achieve profitability. I’ll then discuss our balance sheet and the additional actions we’ve taken to delever the balance sheet and improve liquidity. I’ll then review our priorities and outlook for the balance of fiscal 2024. Let’s begin with our first quarter fiscal ‘24 results. Overall, we view Q1 as a key inflection point as significant business transformation we’ve undertaken over the past year reflected in results across our P&L. We delivered revenue growth and profitability improvement across virtually all of our businesses, generate additional cost savings and remain firmly on track to achieve $240 million to $310 million of cost reductions by the end of current fiscal year. Looking at our consolidated financial results, we delivered net revenue of $109 million in Q1, which is up 3% compared to Q1 of last year. Excluding the impact of retail divestiture, net revenue increased 16%. Drivers of revenue growth were BioSteel, which was up 137% and Storz & Bickel up 16% year-over-year. Q1 gross margin was 5% with all businesses, except for BioSteel showing improvement on a year-over-year basis. Excluding BioSteel, Q1 gross margin was 18%, and adding back non-cash depreciation and E&O expenses, we estimate cash, gross margin was approximately 35%, excluding BioSteel. Q1 adjusted EBITDA loss was $58 million, an improvement of over $20 million relative to Q1 of fiscal ‘23. We estimate over 60% of adjusted EBITDA loss in was attributable to BioSteel. Free cash flow was an outflow of $151 million, which included a few non-recurring items, which I’ll speak to in more detail later on. I’d like to now review the results of our key businesses in more detail. Starting with Canada, Q1 net revenue was $40 million, a second quarter in a row of sequential revenue increase. Our adult-use B2B business was down 9% compared to last year, but was up 12% compared to the prior quarter, led by strong growth from our Tweed flower and pre-rolled products. Canadian medical sales increased 7% compared to last year. Gross margin was negative 1% and cash gross margin, adding back non-cash depreciation cost and E&O expenses and COGS was an estimated 32%. The improvement versus last year was driven by the cost reduction actions was implemented, including savings across our cultivations, direct and indirect manufacturing costs, facility and distribution costs as part of our business transformation plan. We expect additional cost reductions to drive further improvement in gross margins. Following our full exit of 1 Hershey main facility at the end of July. Rest of the world cannabis sales were down 26% year-over-year, but increased 16% versus Q4 of fiscal ‘23. Last year’s revenue included a $3.5 million opportunistic bulk sales to Israel, as well as a one-time crude sale in the U.S. CBD business. Gross margin was 34%, reflecting an improvement in our U.S. CBD business post our strategy shift, partially offset by a geographic mix shift with last year’s margin boosted by high-margin bulk sales to Israel. So when you look at our cannabis business in total, we delivered revenue of $50 million, gross margin of 18%, and an estimated cash gross margin of 32% in Q1. Turning to non-cannabis, starting with Storz & Bickel. S&B saw its revenue return to growth in Q1 with sales growing 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by improved U.S. performance. As you recall, our U.S. sales in fiscal 2023 were negatively impacted in part by financial challenges at certain distribution partners. Over the course of the past several months, we’ve enhanced our U.S. presence with additional resources, and this effort is driving expanded distribution of the Storz & Bickel and vaporizers in our key U.S. market. S&B gross margin saw an improvement to 43% compared to 36% a year ago, driven by higher sales in the U.S. This Works grew its sales 9%s year-over-year, benefiting from increased contributions from its body care product line. Gross margin remains healthy at 48%. Let me now spend a couple of minutes on BioSteel. BioSteel saw an outsized revenue growth this quarter, up 137% to over $32 million during Q1, driven by increased distribution into food, drug, mass and club channel in Canada. Saw strong velocity driven by increased brand awareness of BioSteel from our NHL sponsorship, which drove greater shipments than expected ahead of the key summer selling season. We believe Q2 performance will show more modest growth. Gross margin came in at a negative 24%, which was impacted by higher warehousing and product costs, inventory destruction costs, E&O expenses due to aging of certain inventory, as well as higher repair and maintenance costs at the Verona manufacturing facility. BioSteel also saw an increase in its SG&A expenses compared to Q1 of last year, driven by higher AMP spend due to the NHL sponsorship costs that began in the second quarter of last fiscal year. As we said in the last call, we’ve implemented a number of actions to reduce our cost across the P&L at BioSteel which are expected to improve both gross margins and reduce AMP spend in the coming quarters. Let me now speak to the progress we’re making on our path-to-profitability. Q1 fiscal ‘24 adjusted EBITDA loss was a negative $58 million compared to $79 million a year ago. The improvement is driven by cost reduction of $47 million from the business transformation plan, which was partially offset by a $6 million decline in BioSteel’s gross margin, a $12 million increase in BioSteel’s AMP spend and lapping last year’s payroll subsidy benefit of $3 million. Looking at our SG&A expenses more closely, selling and marketing, G&A and R&D expenses declined by a combined $15 million or 17% compared to a year ago. Excluding increased investments in BioSteel, selling and marketing, G&A and R&D expenses declined by $26 million or 30% year-over-year. Our acquisition, divestiture and other costs increased by $5 million to $9 million, with the biggest driver of the increase is over $5 million of costs related to the restatement of BioSteel’s historical financials. I’d like to now review our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investment balance at June quarter end was $571 million, reflecting a net cash outflow of $212 million from the March quarter end. Breaking down the cash outflow of $212 million, first cash flow from operations was an outflow of $149 million, included in the cash outflow was a $30 million interest payments. Q1 cash outflow also included several non-recurring cash payments, including $17 million in litigation related payments and cash restructuring costs that we did not expect to recur. And BioSteel saw an increase in working capital this quarter due to sales growth, including an approximately $16 million increase in its accounts receivables. We expect our cash flow from operations excluding BioSteel to be roughly in line with our interest expenses as we exit FY24, driven by the completion of our cost reduction program. Second, within cash flow from investing activities, Q1 saw an inflow of $83 million from disposition of facilities that we closed as part of our transformation -- business transformation plan. We continue to expect additional proceeds from asset sales before the end of September for total proceeds of up to $150 million and net financing activity resulted in an outflow of $133 million. Debt pay-down during Q1 of $118 million relates to the second pay-down of the senior secure term loan following the agreement in October of 2022, the $15 million other financing activities related to the lease termination payments for the Quebec JV that we exited. Turning to the balance sheet, as of June 30, 2023, we had $571 million in cash and short-term investments, and total debt of $1.045 billion. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we’ve taken additional actions to strengthen the balance sheet and improve liquidity. We settled a full $237 million principal amount of the July 2023 unsecured notes and we’re exchanging $64 million of the notes into equity, refinancing $40 million into a new convertible note, which we expect to equitize post our annual shareholder meeting in September and paying the remaining $133 million in cash. We made $93 million of payment to reduce a $100 million of the senior secured term loan principal amount and $0.93 for the dollar, and we removed [ph] the minimum cash for liquidity covenant under this term loan. We also remain on track to generate total proceeds of up to $150 million by end of September, of which 90% of the net proceeds will be used to pay down the term loan at $0.95 on a dollar. So following the completion of these actions and assuming that the promissory note held by Constellation is settled in equity, we estimate our total debt balance will decline to approximately $570 million with minimal short-term debt obligation. In addition, our annual interest expenses are expected to be reduced by $20 million to $30 million to approximately $80 million to $90 million at current interest rates, resulting in additional cash savings going forward. And we continue to work on a number of options that are executable over the next coming months that would strengthen our financial position and improve liquidity. I’d like to now provide our key priorities and outlook for the balance of fiscal ‘24. In Canada cannabis, we’re firmly on a path to achieving profitability at current run rate revenue as we achieve the remainder of cost reduction program. We also believe that the addition of Wana gummies into our portfolio provides potential upside to both sales and profitability in the back half of our fiscal ‘24. In rest of the world cannabis, we expect continued growth in Australia and Poland as well as improved performance in Germany, driven by new supply of high THC flower in the back half of our fiscal 24 restore. For Storz & Bickel, Q2 is expected to be impacted by seasonality with sales and profit down compared to Q1. However, we expect growth in the back half of the year driven by a new product launch in the fall and a continued focus on improving performance in the U.S. For BioSteel, we expect Q2 sales to show more modest growth compared to Q1 as sales velocity and shipment patterns are expected to normalize post the summer selling season. This Works sales are expected to be down in Q2 versus Q1, again impacted by seasonality. From a cash flow standpoint, we expect our cash from operation exiting fiscal 2024 to be aligned to our interest expenses, excluding BioSteel based on current business momentum across our core businesses and completion of our cost reduction program. So, in closing, we believe Q1 results demonstrate that we’re well underway to achieving our target of positive adjusted EBITDA as we exit 2024 with the exception of BioSteel. We’re also actively working to remove the drag toward profitability and cash flow for BioSteel as soon as possible, and several initiatives are underway to continue to improve our balance sheet and strengthen our financial position. This concludes our prepared comments. We’ll now take your questions. Operator, David and I are now happy to take questions from analysts. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Vivien Azer at TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nVivien Azer: So, Judy, you mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks that Wana could present upside to the targets that you’re reaffirming today. And David, in your prepared remarks earlier you noted that the Wana distribution agreement would be accretive to both revenues and profitability. So, I just want to dig into that a little bit more and better understand how, number one, the economics work on distribution. Because really, like for a business at scale, which maybe that’s just not the case here, CPG margins are generally higher than distribution margins. So, I just want to understand that a little bit. And then more importantly, I think from a strategic standpoint, like how are you thinking about prioritizing Wana your total portfolio? Because it seems to me that you guys are having a fair amount of success in revitalizing your master brand in flower, but the master brand approach that you guys asserted seems to have brought a lot of risk to the portfolio, right? And so, if you’re picking different brands across different categories, maybe you’re de-risking the portfolio a little bit. So, I’d love to get your perspective on that. Thank you so much.\nDavid Klein: Yes. So, I’ll start. So, Wana in Canada, right now is roughly a 13 share of the edibles market. And we think that with our teams driving distribution in Canada, we can grow that share a reasonable amount. We -- as a result of our ownership of Wana through the option structure, we actually will get all of the brand owner economics for Wana in Canada. So it’s not just distribution margin, it’s the entire margin related to brand ownership as well as distribution. Of course, we have to pay cost to manufacture to our CMO partner. So, that’s why we think it’s generally accretive, from a growth standpoint it’ll be accretive, from an EBITDA standpoint and a margin standpoint. And we also think it will -- it’s just a nice ad from a dollar standpoint to our portfolio. I’ll address the master brand approach, because I think if you look at the brands we have in Canada, the flower brands in Canada, we focused on revitalizing Tweed first because Tweed is actually according to surveys the best known cannabis brand in Canada. However, we had some work to do from a quality standpoint. And I think we’ve now delivered that quality into the market and we saw a lot of growth behind a couple of really strong strains in Tweed. And we’ll apply that to Doja brand and 7ACRES brands in the flower space. Talked about Wana in the edible space in Canada. And then from a beverages perspective, we continue to drive Tweed as a beverage brand as well as Deep Space as a beverage brand in this market. So, we like that. And then Vivien, the other thing that we like is having Wana in markets like Toronto and Montreal and Vancouver, as well as having it in markets like the Surterra markets in Florida and their overall positioning in Colorado. So, it starts to get exposure and feel like a real North American brand. And we’ve said this before and I know we don’t disclose financials as it relates to Wana, but it’s a profitable business that’s positioned really well in some really key markets across the U.S. and yes, we just want to revitalize that in Canada.\nJudy Hong: And then Vivien, I think just in terms of -- from a financial standpoint, if we take a step back, what we said about Canada was that all the actions that we’ve taken was really to position Canada to achieve profitability at the current run rate of revenue. And I think I’ve said in the past that if we achieve $35 million to $40 million of revenue in Canada, then we believe that we have the cost structure to achieve our profitability. And this is now the three quarters in a row where we’ve been in that range of revenue. So, to the extent that Wana provides upside to that range of revenue, we think that there is potentially an upside to improving our profitability in the Canadian business. We’ll provide more details as we get more color just in terms of the revenue and the profit potential of the brand, once it’s fully in the Canopy system in Canada.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Aaron Grey at Alliance Global Partners. Please go ahead.\nAaron Grey: I want to shift a little bit to international. So I know, more recently you’ve been bringing up Australia and Poland, but want to talk a bit about Germany. You mentioned a little bit about getting the high THC flower in the supply. Some of your peers in that country have been talking about potential big uptick in inpatient growth given it’s going to be removed from the narcotics. So what is your take on Germany, given that what’s been one of your key markets that you’re going to look towards? So do you think there’s a lot of opportunity there for reinvigorated patient growth going forward that you might be able to take advantage of and how you think about that market? Thanks.\nDavid Klein: Yes. So, Aaron, we’ve done a lot of work to get regulatory clearance for our strain offerings in Germany and to ensure that we had the GMP production capacity in Canada. And we feel good about our ability to produce the right strains for that market. And at the beginning of July, we actually added to -- significantly actually to our sales team in Germany, so that we can address that market really well. So, we feel bullish on it. Again, I think we’re seeing a lot of growth out of Australia. We’re seeing really good growth in the market in Poland. And we believe that we can get some good growth out of the German market as well. And as Judy called out in her comments, we feel good about the performance of that international business. It’s a little bit muted on a year-over-year basis because of the one-off sale into Israel this quarter last year. But, we feel pretty bullish on the international markets.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Michael Lavery at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to drill into to BioSteel a little bit. It drove the beat against our estimates and has some nice momentum, but, obviously you’ve been clear that it’s got a investment level that’s not appropriate for where you are and that it -- you’re looking for a better home for it. But I guess a couple things related to that. If the economics are a little tricky given kind of the ramp-up stage it’s in, is -- have you found a lot of demand for that? Is there somebody with more appetite to -- and ability to make that investment upfront? And I guess, timing wise, can you give a sense, if that does go through when we might expect that to happen? Is this something that is in the works or I know there’s not much detail in these things that you’re normally able to give, but just some sense of how to think about what the trajectory looks like and where that fits in kind of the rest of the year or into 2025?\nDavid Klein: Yes. Michael, that’s a fair question. So, we love the BioSteel brand as consumers and consumers love the brand. It’s authentic. It’s healthy. It resonates with consumers, both athletically inspired consumers and others. But as we started on this path to really simplify our business and focus on the cannabis industry that we believe in this $50 billion to $70 billion addressable market that we have in the cannabis business just in North America, it just becomes clear that there -- that we need to make sure that we’re at least not sitting here with a real strong drag coming from a brand like BioSteel that’s not a cannabis focused brand that sits in our portfolio. Right? So, as we said in my comments, and it’s really probably all I can offer at this point is, we’re working with our Board and with the BioSteel team to significantly reduce the drag on EBITDA and cash flow that we’re experiencing from BioSteel and we’re going to move as quickly as we can on that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from John Zamparo at CIBC. Please go ahead.\nJohn Zamparo: My question is on the cost reduction plan, and it’s a fairly wide range that you have remaining when you think about what’s left. And I wonder, what are some of the factors that’ll determine whether you get closer to the $240 million end of the range or the $310 million? And just a clarification on that. Does that range include remediation efforts on the BioSteel brand, or is that to be considered ex-BioSteel?\nJudy Hong: So I’ll address it, John. So to address the second part of your question, this is really excluding BioSteel. So, the cost reduction plan is really around the Canada transformation plan, as well as just the reductions that we’ve made across our organization, to ensure that we are continuing to streamline our businesses, simplify our operations. And as a result, we’ve been obviously able to generate significant cost savings year-to-date and from fiscal ‘23, and we have remaining cost reduction program to get to that range of $240 million to $310 million target. The reason that we’re leaving the range wider at this point in time is really, I think the second kind of phase of our cost reduction program is just starting before -- has executed in July. And that’s really about exiting a full exit of the One Hershey, the main campus where we’ve fully exited the operations. We have obviously, moved all of the production over to the beverage -- the old beverage facility and saving on all of the manufacturing and indirect costs and direct manufacturing costs. So, we think we’ve done a good enough of a modeling job to understand where the cost reductions are coming from, but we just want to make sure that as we’re executing the plan that that range is appropriate, and we’ll provide more details as we have the full P&L visibility in the coming months.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matt Bottomley at Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Yewon Kang [ph] on for Matt Bottomley. Thanks for the question. I guess just wanted to touch on the EBITDA guidance that was reiterated for fiscal 2024, and apologies if I missed this earlier during the prepare remarks. But just trying to understand the different components within the quarterly adjusted EBITDA loss amount for the current quarter. So, given that the current outlook is calling for all segments except BioSteel to continue positively to adjusted EBITDA for the full year, could you maybe help us dimensionalize the contributions from each of the segments for the quarter and how we should think about these segments’ contributions to the total adjusted EBITDA amount for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nJudy Hong: So, I’ll try to be as helpful as I can. So I think I can do that by just giving a bit of a bridge in Q1. So, our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q1 was roughly $58 million. I commented in my remarks that we estimate about 60% of that loss is attributable to BioSteel. So, if you’re basically removing BioSteel’s loss from that $58 million, you’re going to be somewhere call it around $25 million of adjusted EBITDA loss. I’ve also outlined that basically we have -- range of the cost savings remaining is roughly $100 million or so at the midpoint of the range. So that $25 million loss will get bridged to our expectation of the breakeven to positive adjusted EBITDA, post completion of all the cost savings programs. So, that’s how you would bridge from excluding BioSteel what’s remaining in Q1 as an adjusted EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA positive exiting FY24.\nOperator: There are no further questions, so I will turn the conference back to Mr. Klein for any final remarks. \nDavid Klein: Yes. Thanks again for joining us today. I encourage you to try some of our outstanding products from our innovative brands as you enjoy the rest of your summer. Our Investor Relations team will be available to answer additional questions. Have a good evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for this afternoon. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask you to please disconnect your lines."
