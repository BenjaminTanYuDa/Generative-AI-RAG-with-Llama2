Good afternoon, and welcome to the Red Cat Holdings Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Financial Results and Corporate Update Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After todayâ€™s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instructions] Participants of this call are advised that the audio of this conference call is being broadcast live over the Internet and is also being recorded for playback purposes. A webcast replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the end of the call through June 18, 2024. Joining us today from Red Cat Holdings are Jeff Thompson, Chief Executive Officer; and Leah Lunger, Interim Chief Financial Officer. During this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including statements that address Red Cat's expectations for future performance or operational results. Forward-looking statements involve risks and other factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information about these risks, please refer to the risk factors described in Red Cat's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and in Red Cat's press release that accompanies this call, particularly the cautionary statements in it. The content of this call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate as of today, March 18, 2024. Except as required by law, Red Cat disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any information to reflect events or circumstances that occur after this call. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff Thompson, Chief Executive Officer. Jeff, please go ahead.\nJeff Thompson: Thank you. Welcome, everyone, to our fiscal year 2024 third quarter earnings conference call. I will first review our Q3 performance and recent achievements. After which, Leah Lunger will review our financial results. Next, I will provide information about our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and then we will take your questions. I am pleased to report that our third quarter results were exceptional, and we once again exceeded our guidance by 16%, achieving our best quarter ever and look forward to finishing the year with another record quarter of organic revenue growth. We believe the Teal 2 airframe is becoming the small UAS of choice for the DoD and other federal agencies as well as over 10 NATO countries. Bringing the Teal 2 drone to market was a significant milestone and the first drone to focus on nighttime operations. The Teal 2 was built to dominate the night. With this reliable new airframe and the traction, we are getting with customers, software companies felt comfortable integrating onto the Teal 2 airframe. This has allowed us to capitalize on software partnerships that will significantly increase our gross margins. The Teal 2 business model has always been to offer an opensource airframe and to be able to put the software that our customers want on the Teal 2 airframe, similar to an iPhone with the apps. Let's talk about our current announced software partners. We are integrating Teledyne FLIR's Prism artificial intelligence platform onto our next-generation drone under development for the U.S. Army's short-range reconnaissance, SRR program of record. Teledyne Prism AI platform provides classification object detection and autonomous tracking technology in real time during both nighttime and daytime operations. We believe customers who purchase this software feature on our drones, will increase our gross margins by approximately 25%. We are also integrating radio software features that allow the Teal 2 drone and the next-generation Teal drone to fly in EW environments or electronic warfare environments. This feature will also increase margins by approximately 20%. We recently announced our partnership with Primordial Labs, which will bring AI driven voice control technology onto our platform. Primordial Labs Anura interface will be incorporated into Red Cat's Teal 2 drones and future products where it will enable operators to leverage natural language to command and control autonomous actions for drones and swarms of drones. Aero environment, we are fully integrated with Tomahawk Robotics, now part of Aero environment. This enables multi-ship and multi-domain capabilities. This software powers Teal 2 4-Ship warm product, allowing a single operator to fly four drones simultaneously to surveil targets with 360-degree situational awareness, and/or to protect an asset which follow the asset capabilities and other formations. We have also fully integrated with Reveal Technology software that delivers intuitive rapid intelligence at the tactical edge blending state-of-the-art computer vision, artificial intelligence and edge computing technologies, giving the Warfighter real-time 2D maps in near real-time 3D mapping and artificial intelligence insight. We have fully integrated with our partner, Athena AI. They have real-time situational awareness through AI-powered soldier readiness, hands-off world space tracking, detecting and identifying entities seamlessly, tactical insights of all detections designed to operate on Soldier Worn AI infrastructure at the tactical edge, advanced visualization of pattern of life and spatial temporal data. We believe that our gross margins with any purchase of one of these software solutions could be approximately 65% plus and if the above customer chooses two or more software features mentioned above, we believe could approach 85% gross margins. In a previous call, I discussed three revenue opportunities driving our growth. They are organic, the replicator initiative and SRR program of record. Let's start with organic revenue growth. We launched the Teal 2 in Q1 2024. Q1 revenue was $1.75 million, a great first quarter for a brand-new drone. Q2 was $3.9 million, 123% sequential quarterly growth. Q3 was $5.85 million, 46% sequential quarterly growth. We believe that even without any large programs of records such as SRR, we can get to cash flow breakeven as we continue to get market share in the small drone defense category. Traditional feet on the street organic revenue is the most difficult to execute. Our business development team has done a great job. And as they tell me this will be the year of international. Let's move on to the Replicator initiative. The Replicator initiative is a strategic effort by the United States Department of Defense, aimed at countering China's military buildup. Here are the key points about the initiative, the objective. The Replicator initiative seeks to deliver thousands of relatively low-cost attritable autonomous systems across multiple domains within 18 to 24 months. These systems are designed to help the Pentagon address the growing military capabilities of China. The Replicator initiative has many moving parts into outsiders that may look messy. The DoD and the DIU are trying to move very quickly, which is something new to a large bureaucratic process. We applaud their progress, our swarm capability and being able to mount an 80-drone portable hive on a ship is unique to Red Cat and Teal. We have stayed connected to the folks at the DoD and the DIU, and we believe our Teal 2 and the new SRR drone are perfect solution for the Replicator commission goals. And last but not least, let's talk about the short-range reconnaissance program of record, otherwise known as SRR. So let me start with our newest addition to our Board of Directors. General Funk II has joined and is an honor to have General Funk on our Board, and we believe he knows what the Warfighter requires. As we mentioned in our press release, small, manned portable unmanned aircraft systems play an increasingly critical role in close reconnaissance to reduce risk and increase lethality to enhance operational success. Just to remind everyone that Red Cat is the only company of the two finalists for SRR that will use sodality to enhance operational success. So, the finer winner take-all selection is expected by September 2024. The contract is for approximately 12,000 drones. The award for the first tranche of production drones two years ago, was $100 million for 1,083 drones. The final delivery of prototypes is in May 2024, more on that when we talk Q4 guidance. We believe we are well positioned with the first drones designed for nighttime operations, a drone that meets the Army's requirements, a drone system that meets the Army's cost requirements, a drone that is open source. It can be continuously upgraded with third-party features, a brand-new factory that can meet the Army's production requests and a drone that a Warfighter would use and with the capabilities to complete their mission roles, which leads to our factory. Production facility in Salt Lake City is in full mass production mode. We are now running 1.5 ships to meet production goals as we continue to invest in facilities, people and processes. We are now demonstrating that we can build tens of thousands of drones yearly. And to finish up, let's talk about Q4 guidance. Q4 guidance is approximately $7 million, putting us at almost a $30 million annual run rate. This guidance is also very impressive considering we must switch production to the Army prototypes in April to satisfy the SRR final prototype delivery in May. If we meet our Q4 guidance, we will have gone from zero Q2 revenue from a product that did not exist last fiscal year to $18.5 million in the Teal 2's first year. With that, I will hand the call over to Leah.\nLeah Lunger: Thank you, Jeff. We are thrilled to report record revenues again for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, totaling $5.8 million. This represents growth of more than 250% year-over-year and 49% on a sequential basis and exceeded our guidance by approximately 16%, as Jeff mentioned. I want to congratulate our business development and manufacturing teams as we've reached a $20 million annualized run rate this quarter, which is a significant accomplishment. Once again, we have guided to continued growth in our fourth fiscal quarter and remain confident in our long-term revenue outlook. Gross margin for the third quarter totaled $1.1 million or approximately 19% of total revenue. On a percentage basis, this represents a year-over-year increase of more than 24% and a sequential decrease of 12%. We anticipate gross margin will steadily improve over time despite fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. This variability occurs for several reasons. First, material and effort required for the short-range reconnaissance contract with the Army vary by deliverable. Second, since we have prioritized building quality customer relationships, we've been generous with our warranties, which can cause variations in gross margin as well. Because of this emphasis on customer service, we are able to leverage feedback from real life product applications in order to iterate and ultimately provide the best possible product. Over time, we anticipate warranty costs to gradually lower relative to other components of cost of goods sold. Third, this quarter marks the completion of the first full year of manufacturing the Teal 2 drone. During this time, our primary focus has been on growing revenue to capture market share. However, we are also implementing operational efficiencies expected to drive improvements in gross margin, which will be imperative as we work toward cash flow breakeven. We expect our full year gross margin to end between 25% and 30%. However, we believe that we can reach gross margins of 50% as production capacity scales exclusive of software add-ons discussed previously by Jeff. During the third quarter, operating loss totaled $4.4 million and cash used in operations totaled $4.1 million, both of which represent a decrease for the third consecutive quarter. As evidenced by the study improvement, we are committed to controlling costs as we grow revenues and further research and development in anticipation of winning the SRR program of record award. Our combined cash and accounts receivable balances as of January 31, 2024, totaled over $12.7 million. In December, we completed a capital raise, which has provided operating runway needed to achieve our strategic objectives during calendar 2024. Last month, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment to Unusual Machines, which included a $1 million cash payment as well as a $2 million interest-bearing note receivable. The completion of this divestiture will enable us to focus even more intently on the success of our enterprise segment. Overall, we remain optimistic about the future of the Company. We are pleased to have find the latest amendment to our Army contract, securing the funding required to complete engineering and deliver prototypes despite funding delays within the DoD as one of only two finalists in the Army short-range reconnaissance Tranche 2 program, we believe we are well positioned to receive an award later this calendar year. The Replicator program, which is expected to include over $1 billion budget across several tranches is focused on fielding thousands of attritable systems, including small UAS. Revenues continue to grow as we expand our customer base domestically as well as internationally. We have now sold our products to customers in over 10 different countries. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashok Kumar with ThinkEquity. Please go ahead.\nAshok Kumar: First, congratulations on the operational results and the appointment of the four-star general Paul Funk on to your board. Three questions. First is, can you give us some color on the margins? And do you expect them to increase over the next 12 months? Second question is you mentioned Replicator has been a common theme on your last three calls. Can you expand on why you're well positioned for this opportunity? And the third, the last question is the international opportunity, you had commented on that in your prepared remarks. When can we expect to get some contract announcements?\nJeff Thompson: Well, Leah, your first day, you're getting the first hot question. So, I'm going to hand it over to Leah on the margin question.\nLeah Lunger: Sounds good. Thank you, Jeff. So, as I mentioned in the call, I do expect margins to improve over the next 12 months. Although we expect there will be some variability by quarter, especially as we complete our engineering effort for the Army. But there are a handful of early manufacturing aspects that we're working on, we expect to improve margins. We've had some onetime scrap items, and we're working towards a 1% scrap rate, which would improve margins. We're also working on improving our yields, which would improve margins because of the related labor costs. And as we grow revenues, production volumes naturally increased, which would improve margins as well due to the overhead allocation. Plus, we believe that we'll receive better pricing on materials as we're able to increase our order volumes with increased production volumes. We've also historically had a very robust warranty program so far that we expect toâ€¦\nJeff Thompson: Leah, let me jump in on the warranties because you -- I'm the one that's dealing with it mostly. And it kind of upsets Leah when we do this. But just to be very frank, folks, we're -- as she mentioned, we have a very generous warranty program. And the reason that we have a generous warranty program at the beginning is we're trying to gain market share on large programs that are converting from our competitors and lots of the time these programs go on for five years. So, we've made the decision to make sure that these people get their drones fixed immediately, if they can't be fixed in the field. And basically, sometimes we get sent back to us, and we find out that it was actually a pilot and operator error, not our issue, but we still support the warranty as we're building market share, and it's worked very well. We expect that the warranty generosity is what I'll say, will continue to go down with all the other items that Leah mentioned and we're -- we've also been pretty aggressive with nonrecurring engineering for the SRR program, which some of that does seep into GAAP margin. So, we have a lot of levers that we'll be pushing over the next couple of quarters to increase our margins and hopefully get to that 50% mark. And then we -- the next thing is we start selling software on top of everything, and that can also increase the margins dramatically. And I think your second question was Replicator? So yes, so Replicator, that is -- the problem with Replicator is that no one's going to be making announcements. So, it's probably going to frustrate the Street not only for Red Cat but other companies that are supplying drones. But we continue to demonstrate products at the DoD and the DIU want the capabilities, they're big on Swarm. And we're the first company with a commercial swarm product called the 4-Ship we came out with that first. And our having that product and recently with our swarm capability, we demonstrated eight hours of perch and stare, using our overcoming the small drone battery limitations utilizing our storm. So, the way I believe that we're well positioned is we have swarm capabilities. We have small attritable drone swarms, it's a perfect fit for the Replicator initiative, and I really can't say more than that. I think your thirdâ€¦\nAshok Kumar: And the last question is related to the international?\nJeff Thompson: Yes. So the -- our biz dev team has been working on more than 10 large RFPs for more than 18 months. And to be frank, a lot of them are larger than. Some of these RFPs are supposed to pop soon and could be our largest contracts yet. So, the work we've done over the last year, almost two years on some of these RFPs are set to be announced winners later this spring. So, we've tested well. The Teal 2 is doing fantastic. And so, we do expect to make some announcements later this year for international.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Michael.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you hear me?\nJeff Thompson: We can hear you.\nUnidentified Analyst: What's the status on the chip production or chip acquisition?\nJeff Thompson: Do you mean as in supply chain?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes.\nJeff Thompson: Well, we've been fine with supply chain for, gosh, over nine months. We are, yes. So, I mean, supply chain is something that I'm always concerned about, but it's not on my daily thought sheet anymore.\nUnidentified Analyst: You said production is at 1.5 shifts right now. Currently, we have a backlog, are we able to accommodate the hopeful anticipated awards with the current shift we have or will we have to employ more shifts? How are we looking at in that realm?\nJeff Thompson: No, we have plenty of the core chips, I think, is what you're talking about that we bought almost two years ago, and they were close to 5,000. We are not going to beâ€¦\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm sorry, shifts in terms of our production. You have 1.5%, you said?\nJeff Thompson: We have 1.5. So basically, we've got a shift and a half. We've got -- we started around 9%, and we end around 9%. So, we've just increased our shifts to handle the increased production needs by our customers. But we can expand to a full second shift. We're just not there yet. We're going to adjust our factory capabilities according to our demand.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So, you anticipate being able to knock out the backlog quickly. Is that correct?\nJeff Thompson: Well, the good news is we have been doing that with these huge increases in revenue every quarter, and we continue to sell more. So we kind of have the best of both worlds. But we will continue to increase our production to not get the backlog too high and to meet the time frames that our customers want. So, if our customers need 90 days, we're going to make sure they get it in 90 days. They need it in 120, we'll make sure they get at 120, if they need it in 60, we'll increase production and get it in 60. So, we have to adjust to our customers.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Thompson, for pre-submitted questions and closing remarks.\nJeff Thompson: Just a bit more coming in. Leah, do you have them?\nLeah Lunger: Listen, would you like me to read the first one?\nOperator: Yes. The first question is, when do you think we could get to profitability, what revenue or what margin or a combination?\nJeff Thompson: Okay. Great. Well, Leah, you're going to keep being in the hot seat today. I'll hand that one to you.\nLeah Lunger: That's great. Yes. So based on our current quarterly operating expenses of about $5.5 million, if we reach 50% gross margins as we hope to, then we we'd expect to reach profitability at approximately $11 million in quarterly revenue.\nOperator: Next is you've mentioned several partnerships. Do you expect to continue to look at acquisitions?\nJeff Thompson: Yes, that's another good question, and we get asked that quite a bit. As you see, we've done a lot of partnerships in the past, you've seen us do partnerships and then you do acquisitions. But right now, we are fine with partnering with a lot of our software friends. We would definitely not do acquisitions down here, where it would be so dilutive, but we are continuing to build relationships with all of our partners. And we think maybe next year, we start looking at acquisitions again. But right now, our revenue is growing so rapidly and we're right on the cusp of getting some basically game-changing large contracts. So, we're going to stay focused on making the Teal 2 great and then when we finalized the SRR, the next-generation bird, which will be the new SRR bird. So, we're going to hold tight for a little bit.\nOperator: The final question is, now that you've closed the sale to Unusual Machines, does this mean you will not be going back to the market?\nJeff Thompson: No, that's a great question. That was a new one. So yes, actually, I'll let Leah review some of that, and then I'll give some final comments after that.\nLeah Lunger: Yes, for sure. So, the sale to Unusual Machines as I mentioned previously, we received a $1 million cash payment after the closing of the sale as well as a $2 million note payable to Red Cat. The note is interest-bearing at 8% and the interest is payable monthly in cash with the principal payment due in full on the maturity date after 2.5 years. However, if you might complete an offering of over $5 million and the note becomes payable in full, which would be just another good opportunity for funding for us. And we are working on finalizing the closing working capital usually with these types of deals that we have, we expect to complete that within six to nine months of the closing date and the closing working capital, which we currently expect to be around $3 million will be either payable in cash or added to the note, and that is that determination is up to Red Cat. Jeff, do you want to comment on the stock that we own in UMAC?\nJeff Thompson: Yes. We also own 4.25 million shares. We are probably going to do some sort of a dividend. We haven't made that decision yet as a Board to existing Red Cat shareholders. But any other remaining shares that we keep, we would never sell and hurt UMAC stock. But if they had a block buyer or things of that nature, there's ways for us to continue to raise non-dilutive money. So, as you can see with the revenue ramp, and we've started to proven that we beat guidance three times in a row now, with our revenue ramp and our costs continuing to come down, we believe that we're not going back to the market at all. And to be very frank, if we get an SRR award or Replicator award, all of those are -- give you a chunk of money upfront. So, our thought process and our modeling is, we are out of the market. So, we're pretty excited about that.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to Jeff Thompson for any closing remarks.\nJeff Thompson: Great. Thanks, Dave. Well, thanks, everybody. We have mentioned -- we believe that we are in a great position to supply drones to the United States military, and we are proud and honored to have them as a customer. We're also ready and willing to help our allies and expect to start getting traction in NATO soon. Teal drones are incredible tools that give asymmetric capabilities to the warfighter. Our full stack technology, including what's being developed for SRR enables data link resilience in EW environments, GPS-denied navigation using visual-based navigation, battlefield decision-making with artificial intelligence, natural language operation with AI, object detection and recognition with AI and will ultimately be able to deliver kinetic effects with human assist to fully close the kill chain. Small drones have changed warfare forever. The Ukraine has demonstrated what small drones can do to expensive military assets. The Wall Street Journal's recent headline reads drone swarms are about to change the balance of military power. Basically, describing what Teal drones has developed. The second half of calendar 2024 is going to be pivotal for Red Cat, and we are set up for success. Thanks again, and good night.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Red Cat Holdings Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Corporate Update Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Participants of this call are advised that the audio of this conference call is being broadcast live over the Internet and is also being recorded for playback purposes. A webcast replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the end of the call through December 15, 2024.  I would now like to turn the call over to Joey Delahoussaye, Vice President of Core IR, the company's Investor Relations firm. Please go ahead, sir. \nJoey Delahoussaye : Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the Red Cat Holdings Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Business Update Conference Call. Joining us today from Red Cat Holdings are Jeff Thompson, Chief Executive Officer; and Joseph Hernon, Chief Financial Officer.  During this call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including statements that address Red Cat's expectations for future performance or operational results. Forward-looking statements involve risks and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those statements.  For more information about these risks, please refer to the risk factors described in Red Cat's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and in Red Cat's press release that accompanies this call, particularly related to cautionary statements in it. Content of this call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today, December 15, 2023.  Except as required by law, Red Cat disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any information to reflect events or circumstances that occur after this call. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff Thompson, chief Executive Officer. Jeff? \nJeffrey Thompson : Welcome, everyone, to our fiscal year 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'll start by summarizing our recent performance and achievements, and then we'll provide information related to our outlook for fiscal year 2024, after which Joseph will review our financial results, and then we will take your questions.  I am pleased to report the second quarter results exceeded expectations and our guidance of $3 million by 30%. Revenue was $3.9 million, 123% sequential growth from Q1. Our margins tripled to 30%. Joseph will supply more detail on this great achievement.  On our last quarterly call, I talked about some of the regulatory tailwinds, hopefully leading to the passage of the American Securities Drone Act. I am happy to report that this past the house in the Senate this week and is on the President's desk to become law.  What does this mean? Well, it means the largest drone manufacturer in the world, whose largest market is in the United States, can no longer by law be bought by anyone that receives federal dollars. It's not just the Department of Defense, it's local groups, it's fire departments, it's anyone who receives any federal dollars. This will be immediate and significantly increase the total addressable market in the U.S. for Teal drones.  I'll move on to revenue opportunities and investment tailwinds. I'm going to discuss the current organic revenue growth and the driver of our backlog. Let's start with organic revenue in our backlog.  Today, we reported Q2 $3.9 million in revenue. Our guidance for Q3 is $5 million. We do not see a revenue from Q3 guidance for the 123% sequential growth in Q2. This guidance for Q3 is based on signed purchase orders. We also have $7.4 million and growing of funded backlog.  As I said on our last call, Q3 revenues of $5 million puts us at a $20 million run rate after selling the Teal 2 for just under 5 months. This is an amazing growth story and would like to thank the entire TEAL team for making it happen. Now let's move on to long-term revenue opportunities.  Short-range reconnaissance program, SRR program of record. Just to review or for the new investors that are on the call, the SRR program of record started over three years ago and was originally set to have three tranches: Tranche 1, 2 and 3. Tranche 1 would have a prototype contract and a production contract. The same was supposed to happen for Tranche 2 and then Tranche 3. We were awarded a Tranche 1 prototype contract, and we were not awarded a production contract. That production contract a couple of years ago was for $100 million for 1,083 drones.  Tranche 2 is supposed to be awarded months ago, but the Army notified us last December and said they were absorbing Tranche 3 into Tranche 2 to accelerate the final product and to get it into the war fighter's hands. This was due mostly because of the Ukraine war, and everyone's understanding how important small drones are. So Tranche 3 was absorbed in Tranche 2.  During our last quarterly call for Q1, I mentioned that we expected the finalist would be announced this December or January 2024. I'm happy to report that we were down selected yesterday as a finalist for the large, long-term SRR program of record.  Before I hand it over to Joseph, a quick summary. We gave guidance for this quarter of $3 million. We delivered $3.9 million, and we are reiterating revenue guidance of $5 million for Q3. We told you about the American Securities Drone Act and expected to pass with the NDA, it passed yesterday. Last quarter, we hoped we'd be a finalist for the Army's SRR program of record. Yesterday, we were awarded a $3-plus million contract and down selected as a finalist. And I will now hand the call over to Joseph. \nJoseph Hernon : Thank you, Jeff, and to everyone for joining the call today. As Jeff noted, we are reporting record revenues, record gross margin and record backlog for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 which ended on October 31. Each of these financial milestones are clear indicators that the Teal 2 is resonating in the marketplace and that Red Cat has not only reached an inflection point, but we have turned a metaphorical corner and are on a clear runway to continued growth in revenues, increasing product gross margin and a backlog that continues to grow despite record shipments.  As Jeff noted, and I want to emphasize, revenues of almost $4 million for the second quarter, represent more than 400% growth year-over-year and 125% on a sequential basis. We have guided to continued growth in the current third quarter and are confident in our revenue outlook longer term.  Our sequential improvement in gross margin on a percentage basis is very impressive. Two quarters ago, we had negative gross margin of 87%. And as we worked on developing a fully integrated manufacturing process for the Teal 2 and our then newly completed state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City. Naturally, there were multiple test runs and processes, which required multiple efforts, resulting in negative gross margins.  In our last quarter, our fiscal 2024, first quarter, we generated gross margins of 10%, which was a dramatic improvement. This quarter, we reported 30%, which is a tripling of our gross margin percentage on a sequential basis. In the eyes of a financial professional like myself, that is an impressive performance by our operating team. Looking forward, we believe that we can reach gross margins of 50% as production capacity scales and we spread our fixed manufacturing overhead over a greater number of units.  There may be some variability going forward from quarter-to-quarter related to our contract work with the Army on our prototype. Gross margin on that contract can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of work we perform relative to what's required for materials versus labor. This work is directly connected to our efforts to secure the [Army] SRR Phase 2 program contract.  As Jeff noted, we were very excited to be awarded an additional $3 million of funding to support the prototype milestones that we have been announced as one of two finalists out of a starting field of 37 competitors speaks for itself, we are playing to win.  Our backlog continues to grow even as we report record revenues. Backlog totaled $4.5 million at October 31, 2023, at the end of the second quarter. And as further increase into the fiscal third quarter to $7 million currently. This clearly demonstrates continuing and growing demand for the Teal 2.  One of our key objectives during calendar 2024 will be to continue to grow revenues, increase our gross margin and control our operating costs. Our operating loss for the second quarter, net of stock-based comp, which everyone knows is a noncash charge, totaled $3.4 million in the fiscal second quarter compared to $4.1 million for the fiscal first quarter, representing a 17% improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That is impressive in my opinion. We are intent on driving our quarterly operating loss lower during calendar 2024, and our recent capital raise now gives us the operating runway to execute on that objective.  In summary, there are a number of key accomplishments that the company has been diligently working on over the past three years that are coming to fruition. Our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, is complete and already demonstrating its ability to scale production. Our made in the USA platform gives us a huge competitive advantage in an industry that has historically relied on sourcing from China. We have completed a rigorous application and review process to secure key government approvals and certifications, including Blue, sUAS, authority to operate and approval to sell through the GSA. The long and arduous investment in building relationships and creating awareness of the capabilities of the Teal 2 by our sales team is yielding benefits as evidenced by a growing backlog.  Finally, as Chief Financial Officer, naturally, I'm not going to predict when Red Cat will reach cash flow breakeven or report profitability, however, I can provide the following for perspective. Revenues for the Teal 2 are increasing, gross margins are growing, and our operating loss is relatively modest in absolute dollars. It will not require an unrealistically steep rate of growth for us to reach breakeven. I believe that steady growth and a focus on controlling costs can get us there.  Meanwhile, we have two huge opportunities that could dramatically change the company's financial position in its market capitalization. The funded replicated program recently announced by the Department of Defense is focused on purchasing thousands of small form drones. Red Cat is an expert on small form drones.  As Jeff noted, we are a finalist for the Tranche 2 program award. Tranche 1 was a $100 million program, Tranche 2 is expected to be much larger. Winning either of these programs would have a huge impact on the company including, I believe, its market capitalization and stock price. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashok Kumar with ThinkEquity. \nAshok Kumar : Just -- you talked a lot about the Replicator initiative from the DoD on your last call. And you didn't mention it today. So could you just update on that? The second question is, do you expect further margin expansion in fiscal third quarter and retaining your top line guidance for the January quarter of $5 million? So I just want to clarify that. And the last question is now that you are one of the two finalists for the SRR and what should we hear next and is there a chance that they select both companies? \nJeffrey Thompson : Yes. So the Replicator initiative has made a lot of news, it's a very exciting initiative. We want to be respectful of the DoD and the [DIU's] mission and we've been getting closely more involved and their mission is to not talk about what specific things are going to be happening and what they're acquiring out there. So we're going to stick with their mission and not talk about what's going on out there and respect that as we don't want to give away what type of assets they are buying to defend against China as that the Replicator initiative is more based on China than anywhere else.  The margin expansion for this Q, for Q3, we're pretty excited about getting to 30% this quick. Our biggest goal is to get to 50% and we've made quite a climb in just one quarter. We expect as we add more units to each quarter that the margins will get better. We sometimes have, can't really call them onetime items, but they are onetime items, they're actually once-in-a-lifetime items. When you're bidding on a large project like SRR, you have a lot of stuff that will be nonrecurring that you have to do that can actually end up into the margins.  And most of the work for SRR Tranche 2 is done at the end of March, once we deliver the last group of systems to the Army, which is at the end of March. So a lot of costs will go away after March, and we expect margins to continue to grow throughout the rest of the year.  And then the SRR program, we -- currently, it is a winner take all. But if you do see the push -- we've seen the push from things like Replicator, they need as many drones from as many people as they can get. There's only two manufacturers that manufacture drones like the drones that are being used in the Ukraine. So we are as Americans, we hope we can make enough drones. We would love to win it as a sole source contract. If they do choose two because they need so many drones -- I just got back from Ukraine, I got to be with the pilots, I guess, do a ride along. They're basically using a lot of drones just like ours, and we hope to get them more of the Teal 2. So I think I answered all three of your questions. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim McIlree with Dawson James. \nJames McIlree : Can you talk about pricing this quarter versus last quarter and versus what's in the backlog? \nJeffrey Thompson : Yes. I mean our pricing is standard. Most of our stuff has to be bought through the GSA. The border patrol buys for the GSA, they all basically come through that. And so a drone and controller combo is approximately $15,000 for that combo. If you're just buying a drone with one controller, it's around a little over $10,000 just for the drone. So those prices don't change pretty much at all unless there's significant volume, which we're not there yet. \nJames McIlree : Yes. The volume was what I was really trying to get at is if you're hitting the volume breakpoints anytime soon. But it sounds like no. \nJeffrey Thompson : What do you mean by breakpoints? \nJames McIlree : Well, at some level of volume, the customer would get the lower price. \nJeffrey Thompson : Yes. No, they haven't hit those thresholds yet. It's -- there's a small discount once they order 100 systems and then the next break is pretty far up. \nJames McIlree : Okay. And then secondly, do you need or do you have foreign military sale of approval? \nJeffrey Thompson : We haven't applied for any foreign military sales currently. The FMS and FMFs, even though the NDA is hopefully getting signed later today by President Biden, the NDAA does not fund FMS and FMF.  We -- the trip that I did just get back from to the Ukraine was to do a few things. One, you have to get your drone tested against electronic warfare and GPS jamming, then you have to basically go through the ODC and the Embassy in Ukraine, which we did. So once we get our testing parameters back from their testing sites, we then submit the letter of request that we get from the Ukrainian government to the U.S. Embassy and the ODC and they'll ship it to DSCA in Huntsville for the FMS -- to get that far, you typically get an FMS award, the U.S. Army will buy the drones and send them to the Ukraine. So that's the entire reason that I actually went to the Ukraine was for an FMS hopefully buy from the Army's for the Ukrainians. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes the question-and-answer session from call participants. I will now turn the call over to Joey Delahoussaye of Core IR to read pre-submitted questions for management. Joey? \nJoey Delahoussaye : Yes. Thank you, Sarah. Jeff, we received a few pre-submitted questions from investors recently and thought this would be a good forum for you to address those questions.  So with that, the first question is last quarter, you said that you did not believe you needed to do an equity raise, and we're looking at non-dilutive financing. Can you explain maybe what changed given the recent equity raise? \nJeffrey Thompson : Yes. No, absolutely. So the bottom line is all of the non-dilutive possibilities, we had no control over. As we likely mentioned Replicator tonight which is who knows when that's coming. We -- Getting an FMS award is they prepay the debt term sheets we were getting were horrific and would have destroyed the company. So basically, we didn't want to play Russian roulette while we're having so many good things happening, great revenue growth, margin expansion, all things that can get us to breakeven.  So we raised the money that we needed to. And you'll notice that we no longer have a going concern in our queue. So we're -- we hope that this is -- Joseph wouldn't say this is enough to get it there, but I think that with everything that we have and the revenue growth that we have, I think we're going to be good. \nJoey Delahoussaye : Okay. Perhaps that addresses the next question, do you think you now have the capital you need to get to breakeven? \nJeffrey Thompson : Yes, this gives us the opportunity to get those non-dilutive opportunities that we can't control in time, but we -- there is no way that the SRR program is not getting awarded between May and September. And we have plenty of money to get to September so that's a non-dilutive event.  If the FMS contracts I was just talking about, that I went to the Ukraine for, they'll pay an upfront contract also. We are going to hopefully see our grant come in from the manufacturing grant that we just received it was non-dilutive, but that's taking more time than we thought, we hopefully get that in the next month or two. So this money gets us where we need to be, and I think it's enough to get us to breakeven. \nJoey Delahoussaye : So that was the last of the previously submitted questions, and thanks for your answers on each. Hopefully, this gave investors some additional insight into what's going on within the company. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks, Jeff? \nJeffrey Thompson : Great. I want to thank everybody. It's unusual for us to have to do this on a Friday, but this is when our actually last day of the quarter. And to file the quarter was. We won't be doing this on Fridays anymore, we would typically done it on Wednesday or something earlier, but we last week threw us off a little bit. We've done a lot in the last two weeks.  But anyway, I'm pretty excited. I want to thank the TEAL team, they're doing a great job, Biz Dev team, they're doing a great job selling our drones. It's going to be a very exciting 2024. Thanks, everybody. \nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Except as required by law, Red Cat disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any information to reflect events or circumstances that occur after this call. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff Thompson, Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?\nJeffrey Thompson: Thanks, Joey. Thank you. Welcome, everyone to our fiscal year 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. I'll start by summarizing our recent performance and achievements, and then I will provide information related to our outlook for fiscal year 2024. After which, Joseph will review our financial results, and then we will take your questions. I am pleased to report that the Teal 2 drone is getting a warm welcome as the most unique and capable nighttime drone in the Group 1 class. We announced the Teal 2 at the Army Aviation Association of America Conference on April 26, a few days before our fiscal year-end. The Teal Drones revenue for fiscal Q1 was $1.75 million. We cannot make a year-over-year comparison because the Teal 2 did not exist. But if you were a start-up and launched a brand-new product and did almost $2 million in revenue in your first quarter, it would be considered a home run, specifically, if there was follow-through, but more on that in our guidance update. And Joey and Joseph, can you make sure that your lines are muted. We're hearing some background noise. So we've met with a lot of investors recently and a lot of them are new to the story. So I'm going to kind of back up and discuss some of the regulatory tailwinds that helped create the United States growing markets current status. So December 2020, DJI, the largest drone manufacturer on the planet, was put on the US government's entity list. In December 2021, DJI was also put on the economic blacklist. Fast forward to July 2023, the American Securities Drone ACT, ASDA, passed the Senate unanimously and we expect it to be law in the next few months. August 2023, Red Cat's Teal 2 receives Remote ID certification from the FAA. This was a huge achievement, the documents over 300 pages, very difficult to get the certification from the FAA. Only a few of us have done it so far. It's so difficult that most companies could not pull it off, and they actually delayed the status and the requirement for six months. So what are all these things -- what are all these regulatory tailwinds mean? Well, it means that the largest drone manufacturer in the world, whose number one market was the United States, can no longer by law be bought by anyone that receive Federal dollars. It's not just the Department of Defense, it's local groups, it's fire departments, it's anyone that receives Federal dollars. This has created a very large market and a very large vacuum for only us and one other manufacturer in the US that can build a scale to fill. So this is a very unique opportunity that doesn't always happen. Now I'll move on into our revenue and investment tailwinds. I'm going to discuss the current organic revenue growth or immediate revenue. I'm going to then discuss the DoD newly announced and funded replicator initiative. We look at that as midterm revenue in the next three to six months. And then the short range reconnaissance SRR program of record, which is a 10-year program of record and most people on this call are waiting for this to happen, but it is a very significant program. So let's start with our organic revenue in our backlog. Today, we reported for Q1 $1.75 million in revenue. Our guidance for Q2 is $3 million, 71% sequential organic growth. Our guidance for Q3 is $5 million, 67% sequential growth on top of 71% sequential growth This guidance is based on signed purchase orders and we expect more in the next 11 days. Q3 revenue of $5 million puts us at a $20 million run rate after selling the Teal 2 for just under five months. This is an amazing growth story and would like to thank the entire Teal team for making it happen. So now let's move on to midterm revenue opportunities, which we believe are in the next three to six months. The replicator initiative. The Pentagon has unveiled a radical new strategy focused on fielding thousands of cheap, smart and autonomous war drones across multiple domains within 18 to 24 months to counter China's military. According to the Wall Street Journal, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, said the Department of Defense plans to develop AI systems intended to be small, smart and cheap to counter threats from China and other countries. Overall, we're going to be delivering in the thousands, Hicks said during Tuesday's interview. Last week, we announced our replicator initiative, the latest effort to overcome the production valley of death beginning with the accelerating the scaling of all domain attributable autonomous systems. So what does this mean? Tens of thousands of disposable drones need to be delivered to the war fighter in 18 months, which means orders most likely need to be delivered to these vendors in the next three to six months. We believe we are very well positioned or already in contact with this program. Now let's move on to long-term revenue opportunities. SRR or short range reconnaissance program of record. Just to review or for new investors that are on the call, SRR program of record started over three years ago and was originally set to have three tranches. Tranche 1, 2 and 3. Tranche 1 would have a prototype contract and a production contract. The same was supposed to happen to Tranche 2 and then Tranche 3. We were awarded Tranche 1 prototype contract and we're not awarded the production contract. That production contract a couple of years ago was for $100 million for 1,083 drones. Tranche 2 was supposed to be awarded months ago, but the US Army notified us last December and said they're putting Tranche 3 into Tranche 2 to accelerate, to get the final product into the war fighter's hands. This was due mostly because of the Ukraine war and everyone's understanding how important small drones are. And actually, that's what also started the replicator initiatives. So Tranche 2 and 3, which is now combined which the next down selection, I believe, is at end of December or early January, if they announce the next down selection on time. We don't know what the actual contract amount is, but the $100 million was for 1,083 drones, the remaining amount on this contract is for 12,000 drones. I'm not doing linear math. I'm not saying that this is going to be a $1.2 billion award, but I am saying, it's going to be significant. And now with the constant need for thousands of drones, we don't know if this will be sized up because of the need for small drones. I will now hand the call over to Joseph. I look forward to your questions.\nJoseph Hernon: Thank you, Jeff, and to everyone for joining the call today. I will now provide a review of our operating results for the fiscal first quarter, which ended on July 31st, 2023. My comments are going to focus on a number of financial-based milestones and events, which leave us strongly positioned for the balance of fiscal '24 and beyond. As many of you know, we have a pending agreement to sell our consumer segment to unusual machines, which I will also refer to as UM. The sales price includes an immediate cash payment of $3 million plus $17 million in shares of UM. We also expect to receive a favorable working capital adjustment of approximately $4 million, which will be payable in additional stock. The sale of the consumer segment is contingent upon universal machines completing an initial public offering on a major stock exchange. UM has recently advised us that they have significantly completed the registration process with the SEC and that they expect to complete an IPO during our fiscal second quarter. Therefore, under the accounting rules since the transaction is likely to close within the next 12 months, the accounting rules require us to report the consumer segment as discontinued operations. The financial accounting and reporting for continued operations is much different than what we have historically reported. Basically, the operating results of our consumer segment, which consists of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot have been condensed into one separate line in each of our financial statements. There is literally no combining of amounts related to our continuing operations, which is our Enterprise segment consisting of Teal and Skypersonic with our discontinued operations, which is our consumer segment consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark. Since we expect to receive approximately $21 million in shares of UM, which will make us a significant shareholder, I will provide a brief review of the Q1 operating results for the Consumer segment. Driven by strong growth at Rotor Riot, Q1 revenues were almost at a record level. The operating loss for consumer was very modest at less than $300,000. UM believes that there are multiple opportunities to continue growing the consumer segment under its stewardship. We believe that our shares in UM will have significant long-term value and frankly represent a hidden value relative to Red Cat's current market capitalization. Turning now to the enterprise segment. As Jeff noted, just before the start of fiscal 2024, we launched the Teal 2 in late April. The market response has been immediate and meaningful. We reported record sales for the Enterprise segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and believe that higher sales will be reported each quarter throughout fiscal 2024. We are already beginning to receive repeat orders and presently have an order backlog of approximately 6 million. As we have noted in prior calls, we initially established relatively high inventory levels in response to supply chain challenges that emerged during COVID-19. These actions led by our COO, Allan Evans, enabled us to secure chips and other electronic components at a time when they were very hard to procure and at reasonable prices. That savvy move leaves us very well positioned today. Thank you, Dr. Evans. With escalating demand for the Teal 2, we estimate that it will cost approximately $3 million to convert our existing $11 million of inventory into approximately 1,200 drones, which represents revenues of 18 million based on our base sales price of 50,000 per drone. This inventory conversion will generate net cash proceeds of approximately 15 million and represents one of a number of cash sources that we expect to realize in fiscal 2024. Our expected cash proceeds of 3 million from the sale of consumer is another source of capital. While we can't immediately sell our 21 million shares of UM, the 180-day lockup period is relatively short and could begin to generate cash proceeds late in fiscal 2024. We expect that orders from government agencies will continue to be the source of most of our enterprise revenues. Due to the high certainty of the funding sources for government-based orders, there are greater than normal opportunities for us to secure financing secured by these orders. Finally, one of our greatest assets is our manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City. Since acquiring Teal in 2021, building this facility has been a huge focus of management, our dedicated employees and our precious capital. The facility is now fully operational and continues to scale manufacturing output. At this time, we are not able to fully leverage its manufacturing capabilities, which is resulting in lower than targeted gross margins. However, as Jeff just noted, we expect orders for the Teal 2 to continue to grow throughout fiscal 2024, and we will manufacture these additional drones at a lower unit cost, which will increase gross margins and operating cash flows. Our drones are made in the USA which continues to become more critically important to government agencies including the military branches. We believe that this provides us with a huge competitive advantage in an industry that is positioned for significant long-term growth. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashok Kumar with ThinkEquity. Please go ahead.\nAshok Kumar: Thank you. Two questions. The first question, two parts. In terms of your Q3 fiscal guidance of 5 million and your current cost structure and improving margins, will that get you close to cash flow positive. And the second part of that question is, given your current cash position and the near-term burn, is there a need to raise capital. The second question is on the competitive front on the SRR program. You're competing with Skydio and Vantage and then you're in a bake-off for the Border Patrol Program with the same competitors. So could you please give us an update on the opportunity and the Border Patrol Program. Thank you.\nJeffrey Thompson: Sure. So let me start with your last question and go backwards here. So, yes, we -- all of us got orders earlier this year. We got an order for about a million drones from the Border Patrol. Skydio did also and Vantage Robotics also got a much smaller order. So, yes, we are in a bake-off to gain their business. We have nothing new to report, but it is interesting, and that's exactly who we're going up against for the large SRR short range reconnaissance program of record. So as soon as we hear, this is the time of the year could be any day if we hopefully, we do hear something, you'll be the first to know. Secondly, I'll go into your question about do we need to raise capital. And we've gotten that question a lot while we were at all these conferences we were at last week. And it's a legitimate question. But let me just start with the C-level and the executives and the employees, we are not hired guns. The company, the employees, we own almost 40% of the shares outstanding. So we've written checks, we're not hired guns. We don't own 0.0% and just want to do a bunch of raises and dilute everybody. Because if we dilute the shareholders, we're half the shareholders almost. So we do not want to do that. So let me go through some of the details on this. As Joseph just mentioned, we'll be turning millions of dollars of inventory into sales over the next couple of quarters. In our first three quarters, we've got about $10 million in shipped revenue we'll be posting, which is more than all of last year, and we're not even done with sales yet. So those numbers could actually be higher. As also as Joseph noticed, we expect to close UMAC in the next few weeks, which will generate approximately 3 million in non-dilutive capital. And he also mentioned the 1 million to 2 million in inventory or more. We also be getting approximately 2.4 million from our SRR prototype contracts starting in November and that goes through March. And we have also recently received research project that could generate approximately $1 million to $2 million. On top of that, last week and as recent as today, we've gotten term sheets, the small debt offerings, not convertible debt, and we stated, as Joseph mentioned, exploring credit lines based on our government contracts, which are much less expensive debt. So to summarize this non-dilutive way to raise capital over the next few months is approximately 7.4 million to 9.4 million in the next six months of non-diluted capital. And if you add a small debt offering, it goes from offering of 3 million to 5 million, which we could easily service in our models. That's a total of 10.4 million to 14.4 million of non-dilutive capital, which is more than enough to get us to cash flow positive. And I think your question for Q3 will 5 million of revenue get us to cash flow positive. We're not going to make that projection yet, but I can tell you that's -- it's pretty darn close at that point. So I think I answered all three of your questions.\nAshok Kumar: Great. Thank you very much and all the best.\nJeffrey Thompson: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jim McIlree with Dawson James. Please go ahead.\nJames McIlree: Yeah, thanks, and good evening. So in your commentary about -- in the commentary about the inventory levels, it suggests that gross margin on this 15 million of revenue of about 22%. I'm assuming that, that's because you've got a high burden of the factory. When you get to either a reasonable capacity utilization or fully utilized? What kind of gross margins would it be reasonable to expect?\nJeffrey Thompson: Yes. I'll touch on the high level and Joseph might want to address. This is something I review with. And the right person for this is Dr. Evans because he's been building factories for the last 10 years. So I'm going to start from the fully utilized factory. If we were pumping out thousands of drones, we literally can get up into the 70% gross margins. At the beginning, you're absolutely correct. Having the full burden of a factory, you open it Day 1, which we have recently, and if you're producing 25 or 50 or 120 drones, your margins look horrible because you got to put this full burden of the factory on top of that. But with our material margins, we're typically right now already in the 40% to 50% range, but we're here doing GAAP. So those -- your numbers are 22% to we could get up to 70% once fully utilized saying to get large contracts with the replicator initiative or SRR can produce those type of margins.\nJoseph Hernon: Yes. I don't have a lot to add on top of that. I think that one of the points that I was trying to make is that we're in a unique position from a cash flow perspective in fiscal '24 because we've already bought and we've already paid for much of the material cost to produce these 1,200 drones. That won't be a typical situation. But because of COVID and the scarcity of electronic components and there was a lot of price gouging going on. Allan had the foresight to go out and frankly spend quite a bit of the money we raised in 2021 to put us in a position where we wouldn't be unable to fill orders because we couldn't get the components we needed. So we're in a unique position right now. And as part of your initial question, yes, we're just dealing with a capacity utilization challenge, which is very common for emerging companies that built the type of facility that we built, which is another -- that's built, that's behind us. That's firing on all cylinders, and that's a huge step for an emerging growth company like us to have behind us. It's kind of one of the reasons why we feel so good about our outlook for the rest of fiscal '24 and beyond.\nJames McIlree: That's great. If I can just ask another one here. So on the SRR and the replicator programs or contracts, are these fixed priced contracts. So you will have the ability to improve margins as you improve your manufacturing or is it more of a time and materials contract.\nJeffrey Thompson: No, no. Yes, I'm sure you're bringing that up because the time and cost are over plus is a horrible business. Now these are fixed. They'll be fixed to our GSA pricing. We're not even allowed to adjust that typically unless there's a large volume. But, yes, our margins will improve dramatically. All of the orders that we've announced before have been GSA pricing. So this will the SRR program will be based on fixed pricing, the replicator program, which is something that also we didn't really go into, but when they were announcing the -- making sure that these small companies that are building these small drones don't go into the value of death, which is the funding value of debt when you're dealing with large government this replicated program, we expect to get paid up front, which alleviates also dilution for us like again as being a large amount of shareholders. So we -- the pricing will be fixed pricing.\nJames McIlree: That's great. And my last one is the 5 million in OpEx this quarter, is that a good number going forward?\nJeffrey Thompson: Yes, I would say so.\nJoseph Hernon: Yes, I would say so as well. Unfortunately, I don't see a lot of cost savings associated with the best in consumer. Obviously, there's a really substantial fixed costs and being a public company. I do think the good news is that higher revenues should not result in dramatic increases in these expenses. You can see operations expense actually decreased in the fiscal first quarter. So I think we're going to be able to leverage both gross margin and our OpEx meaning that as revenues increase, I don't see dramatic step in step increases in OpEx.\nJames McIlree: Great. Thank you very much. That's it for me.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Showing no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session of the call. I will now return the call to Jeff Thompson for closing remarks.\nJeffrey Thompson: Sorry, folks, I was on mute. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. I want to thank the team at Teal. I want to thank our BizDev team. You guys are awesome. And we'll be seeing a lot of you out. We're in a lot of conferences and I'll even plug James' and his company, but we'll be at the Dawson James conference on the 12th and we'll be at the LD Micro in early October. So please come see us.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
