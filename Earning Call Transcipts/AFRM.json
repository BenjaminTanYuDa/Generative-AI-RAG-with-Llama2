Following the speakers' remarks, we will open the lines for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. Iâ€™d now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator.

Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, a firm's Chief Financial Officer. In line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into questions and answers. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Thank you all for joining us today. We're excited to share the results of another great quarter. As is our custom, the better the results, the fewer words we used to comment on them. This time around, I feel good enough to go directly to the Q&A. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Thank you, Max. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this evening. I was wondering, if you could help us think through RLTC for the remaining two quarters of the year. Sort of what are the drivers, puts and takes, variables that could impact our RLTC and drive underperformance or outperformance. How should we think about those kind of variables?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. I think, obviously, if you're thinking in terms of percentage of GMV, there's a number of factors, mix and macro at the top of the list. If you're thinking about total dollars then GMV on the platform was going to be the biggest driver of results there. In terms of the RLTC rate, the take rate on a percentage of GMV, it's really mix and macro. So the mix of business across our merchant base and the products that we offer there. And from a macro perspective, everything going on with consumers and rates would be there. We really like the environment we're in right now. That's why we've updated our full year guidance like we have. And so we feel good about the back half of the year. RLTC margins as a percentage of GMV and feel good about that because of the macro environment that we're in. And we -- as per the usual, we take the current macro signals current levels of unemployment, current forward curve and bake goes into our assumptions. But obviously, there are scenarios where those could move one way or the other, that would change the outcome for us.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And a follow-up for me. On Slide 10, where you list out your GMV vertical mix, it looks like general merchandise has picked up quite a bit from travel and ticketing or travel and ticketing has gone down and general merchandise gone up. Are there any drivers to call out there? And I guess, more broadly, can you just comment on performance across key verticals in there?\nMichael Linford: So travel and ticketing is a very seasonal category. So a lot of folks book summer vacation travel in the first two calendar quarters, last two fiscal quarters, of our year, and it tends to be lowest in terms of bookings in calendar quarters like Q2. And so we think there's a huge seasonality factor there. And for general merchandise, some of our largest merchant enterprise partners fall in that bucket. And as we continue to scale those, we will see lots of purchases there, and it's not unusual for that to be a category that spikes in and around holiday season has a lot of holiday shopping is done in those channels.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Makes perfect sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Appreciate you taking the question. Max, brevity is indeed the sister of talent, I'll make that very clear. So I've got a couple of questions just on GMV growth and tender share. As I recall, you've tightened the credit box about a year ago, and obviously, the back half of the fiscal year looks strong. Can you comment either Max or Michael, just on kind of how underwriting and risk are factoring into that strength? And then the corollary, I guess, or the follow-on would be around tender share of your enterprise customers, and it appeared to be elevated during the holidays, and I just wonder if that's a sign of accelerating tender share to come or aspirational end or share growth?\nMax Levchin: Appreciate the comments, first of all. The underwriting settings, so the single most I would say, accelerated change we've conducted to our, as we call it, Box, it was really more a 1.5 years ago than a year ago. April of '22 is when we saw real stress on the consumer, and we reacted to that sort of within the next 60 days or so. We've since really not done an enormous amount of significant steering. We changed marginal cutoffs on a merchant-by-merchant category by category, product by product basis all the time and also change things like allowed terms as durations required down payments, etc. So we managed credit very, very actively since sort of the beginning of time for us but there's not been a major change to our posture in the last 1.5 years. The numbers that we printed just now are not an accident. We drove them to be what they are very, very deliberately. And I don't want anybody to sort of assume that we're hands off and the numbers just print themselves. It's a lot of work, and we care quite a lot where they end up. We have certain expectations we set with capital markets, and we intend to continue delivering those expectations. And so that's first and foremost. And that governs a lot of our metrics that put to that. The tender share -- share of wallet as we go on internally has done really well over the holidays. We've generally been gaining wallet share, although the stories are different category. And in some cases, merchant to merchant. Feel very good about some of the things that we announced. Obviously, offline. We were not a noticeable player until recently in between the card and some of the online -- offline self-checkout kiosks really powerful. And then just sort of call out one, particularly strong performance over the holidays, especially and overall in the last quarter, Shopify has just continued to perform extraordinarily. The growth of that particular partnership is accelerating three plus years into the partnership. That set of products grew about twice the speed of the rest of Affirm. And so it's just been a story of success to success. And we still have a lot of things that we have not scaled out. They have their own offline aspirations that we're obviously very excited to be a part of, etc. And so it's a little bit of a -- and I'm giving a very long-winded answer here, but frequency for us is being where consumer shops. And share of tender comes as a consequence of being available and being able to support the various consumer needs that as we encounter them.\nMichael Linford: And the only thing I'd add is we did with the 36% APR cap that we were able to get in place, we were able to be more expansionary in a number of places that is completely done now. And so we wouldn't expect any more volume benefit there, although there is still some margin benefit, we think that will come as the program continues to roll out and scale but we wouldn't expect any more volume there because of 36%.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nReginald Smith: Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. I guess you kept your comments short. But I guess where were you most surprised and this is a pretty big beat. And then I had a follow-up after that.\nMax Levchin: We try to run a tight ship, so surprises are rarely a welcome thing and if they are to the good. I think, I already called that out, but I thought Shopify as a company, years to have done a fantastic job with their products, and we stand to support our partners there and have done it all together. Let's see what other surprises. Don't like surprises, Reggie. I feel like, anytime somebody surprise me, I'm not going to like the outcome. Actually, I'll give you one very surprising fact, which is a little bit of an inside view, but we had very noticeably accelerated our ability to ship software and I had anticipated some of that, but I'm quite surprised about how productive the teams have been on the engineering side, on the product side and design side, sort of percolates down to revenue. So generally speaking, I expected that we would rally around the goals, especially from sort of the low point of this time last year. But the if it's a turnaround, it's a much faster and more aggressive turnaround than I expected.\nReginald Smith: Got it. And then just looking at the seasonal patterns of your margins, the back half of the year tends to be better than the front half of the year. And when I look at your full year guidance for your operating margin, I guess it implies in the third quarter, I think it implies a pretty sequential increase in and expenses below the RLTC line? Like, what's driving that and kind of where should we see that show up? Is it a marketing thing? Is it technology? My rough math was almost like $20 million of sequential increase to -- I'm not sure if that's right or not. But if you can comment on that a little bit, that would be helpful.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. We donâ€™t provide a specific guidance number for there. So sometimes the way in which we build our guidance can lead to a little bit of exaggeration on that as you calculate it. But thatâ€™s right. And thereâ€™s a couple of factors to think about. Firstly, we â€“ and this will sound very trivial, but I promise you it does actually end up becoming pretty big. We do expect there to be a lot more payroll tax associated with stock-based compensation in our first quarter, both because people have reset their tax obligations to â€“ with the new year, but also because the share price is higher. And both those two things will create a little bit of the sequential bump from quarter-to-quarter. And then we remain really excited about the opportunities that are ahead for us. And so weâ€™re continuing to be thoughtful around where we should be adding resources to go build new products and chase the new opportunities. And I think the strength in this quarterâ€™s results with respect to our unit economics and operating efficiency, give us license to be willing to add a little operating expense, whereas I think weâ€™ve been very cautious to do that until we could demonstrate it.\nReginald Smith: Understood. Congratulations. Great quarter.\nMichael Linford: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results. Congrats, Max and Mike and the team. Quick question -- I have two questions. The first one is on the guide. Obviously, the knee-jerk reaction, which we disagree with was that the GMV guide is conservative. You beat by $700 million. You're increasing the guide by $1 billion -- and for GMV, like you sound very upbeat about the macro. Is it just conservatism?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. I mean, just like we have all year long for the full year, we're only providing a floor or our full year guide. And so we did take our floor up by $1 billion, which we think is a pretty big step up in what we would expect for the year. We remain very upbeat and excited about the opportunity. .\nDan Dolev: Got it. Yeah. No, that's what it seems like. And then maybe one other question on kind of the direct deposit opportunity. You've had tremendous success with the card. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the usage and frequency for the people that are doing the direct deposit into the card or into the Affirm app?\nMax Levchin: A little early. We gave the future name about 60-something days ago. So it's a little early to brag about the results. But we feel very good about it. It's done in the early versions that it is about as well as we could hope for. We have a lot more things coming for that product, working on a couple of very specific things that are just required before you can really call yourself an account. But feel great. Itâ€™s definitely â€“ and I think I mentioned this before, but thereâ€™s kind of three stages of Affirm usage. If you are a not cardholder, non-account holder, regular user, frequencies 4.5 transactions a year and grew again 20% plus year-on-year. But if you have a card that goes up quite a lot, is about 4x, and then it grows again, fairly significantly if you are an account holder. So very excited to give more accounts to people because thatâ€™s ultimately a frequency driver for us as well.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Well, it sounds like a huge opportunity. Congrats again.\nMax Levchin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Wildhack: Hey, guys. May I ask a question on volume in a different way. I think the shareholder letter called out three quarters of accelerating volume growth and then within the December quarter each month, accelerated to the updated outlook for the rest of the year seems to point to a pretty healthy slowdown in the second half, half over half. So I wanted to get your thoughts on what might be driving that slowdown if there's anything specific that you're seeing?\nMichael Linford: So again, I think the full year outlook for us is just a floor. And so we've not given even a range or a ceiling to where we'd expect any calculation being done on Q4 is probably not getting to a midpoint. And any math you're doing on that number inclusive of our Q3 range is taking -- is probably squeezing that number quite a bit. Separate from that, we had a really good Q2, right? And so the really strong second quarter isn't something that we would ever take and say that's a fundamental change of business. That's something we would take credit for, be very happy with, but we'd be pretty cautious about how we would build up the outlook for the balance of the year and want to be mindful of all of the factors that can go into that. But there's nothing in our business that would suggest that we're slowing down right now.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. Thanks. And then your picture, and I appreciate this may not be in play for this fiscal year, but how would you expect potential interest rate cuts to flow through to funding costs? And then strategically, would you want to drop those savings to the bottom line via higher RLTC margin or do something different?\nMichael Linford: That's a great question. So whenever we think about a change in rates, we need to understand why the rates are moving. Certainly, if the rates are moving in response to other stress in the economy, specifically employment, then it's not a one-for-one benefit. But if you hold all other factors constant, then a decline in rates would help us the RLTC line. We would seek to continue to run the business in the 3% to 4% range that we've talked about really since we've gone public. And if we were able to be earning at the high end or above that, we would seek to reinvest that in products to engage and reengage -- acquire new users and reengage them.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you. So you highlighted in the shareholder letter, I think that 2/3 of the revenue growth in the quarter was from interest income. Is it fair to say that's also the revenue line item that surprised you most to the upside relative to your guidance? And just curious how much of the revenue guidance range for the fiscal year is coming from the interest income line, you guys have obviously been doing a really good job on that side of the equation.\nMichael Linford: No. Certainly, we're happy to have the unit economics we do have, but I think we're probably more surprised with the healthy merchant fee growth. Whenever merchant fees outpaced GMV growth, it creates pretty good flow through to the full P&L in a way that's outsized. I think some of the strong performance we had above our expectations around RLTC and the flow-through for the full P&L was actually driven by the really healthy merchant line. Yes, the total aggregate revenue growth wasn't there. But remember, against that, interest income growth is a pretty steep rise in funding costs, and that's driven by both the balance sheet growth as well as the higher benchmark rates that we're in this year. And in fact, interest funding costs grew faster than interest income. And so while that was important for us to be able to get the business where it is, it's also the case that -- we don't see that as the real tailwind here. We're still managing through a rate environment that's substantially lower last year than this year. And as those things abate, then we will begin to see the benefit end of the future.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then just like a two-part question on GMV. What's your latest expectation for Affirm card GMV this fiscal year? And then any comments you might have around January GMV trends. I'm kind of curious because we heard from others that card-present volumes suffered because of the severe weather. So just wondering if your business benefited at all from that? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: So we've not given any outlook for the card, and I won't now. What I would say in the letter, we talked briefly about the seasonality of the card, and I think this is a really important thing for everybody to pay attention to, which is the card had really strong growth from Q1 to Q2. We would estimate that about half of that growth in card volume was actually underlying seasonality and the other half was growth in the card which just means as you think through where the volume should be for the card in the balance of the year. Just keep in mind the Q2 starting point is benefited by a pretty big step up from Q1 to Q2 from seasonality as consumers do spend more in the holiday season. And weâ€™re still early enough with the card. Fortunately, weâ€™re not seeing things like weather impact our card performance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jill Shea with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJill Shea: Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide us an update on the Shopify partnership and any stats that you could share with us, that would be great. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Hi. It's one of the highlights of this last quarter is going unbelievably strong. It accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. The program is over three years old and the fact that it's still picking up steam is just great, and they've been extraordinary partners to us and nothing but wonderful things to say about Tobi and CAS in Arlington team there, and there's just been nothing but excellent in both our execution and the partnership that we had. I think already drop that stat. But the program at Shopify grew twice the speed of the overall Affirm growth on the GMV side of things. They have aspirations off-line that they're going after quite strongly and there's still a lot of synergies and what we're doing now there. We have a whole host of programs we're contemplating going forward. So lots of with the job feeling very good. The fact that it's accelerating suggests that there's just more growth to be had for both of us.\nJill Shea: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much this afternoon, guys, for all the time. I wanted to ask on 0% promotions. It seemed like, at least anecdotally, those increase some, particularly towards the end of the December quarter. And I think in your supplement, you showed that 0% long duration merchant rates had picked up. Can you talk a little bit about like what's driving that merchant rate tick up? Is it just longer duration generally within that long group? And how should we think about that both in terms of impact on RLTC margin, but also in terms of the type of customer and that you're bringing in with those promotions? Just wondering if that's enough to move the needle on some of these other metrics.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. It's a good question. The -- as rates have gone up, any of our longer-term 0% programs have needed higher merchant fees and I really think there's really not much more to it than that. So it's the mix and tied to benchmark rates. In terms of the customers that we bring in, it does skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum when you do those kind of products. But given the high levels of repeat, it's not really going to change the average as much at Affirm. We, of course, have been, we were very active. We're meeting our merchant partners where we could in providing anything promotionally in the second quarter, and we continue to do that. But it's it didn't change an awful lot from the prior quarter in terms of the total mix. So I wouldn't -- I don't really think there's a fundamental trend there.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And then I wanted to ask, maybe it's a little bit convoluted question, but you're obviously growing the Affirm card really nicely kind of that run rate that you talked about seems to be around 100,000 cards a quarter or I'm sorry, a month. How should we think about is, a, I'm wondering how we should think about the availability or the credit pool available and how that's growing by comparison, right? Because as you send out cards, people will use it, you said most of it of that is interest bearing. So some of that available credit gets absorbed, but then there's new credit growth in that pool as you add more cards. So just how should we think about that potential to buy pool growing vis-a-vis the growth in cards. Hopefully, that question makes sense.\nMax Levchin: I'm going to try to answer, but feel free to tell me that I'm answering their own questions. So I think you're asking -- I guess, the way I'm interpreting this overall, at least try to answer is, does the card availability to consumers create new pools available transactions for us to take on? And the answer is yes. Our off-line usage with the card versus without the card is drastically different. And so all of those transactions are entirely incremental. It's not really all that magical why transactions of the cardholders are significantly higher than average transactions for non-cardholder from user, it's because these people are for, they're more committed because they requested a card. And two, they're bringing it to stores. So it's it just touches a larger open field opportunity. In terms of underwriting and sort of our exposure on the credit side, et cetera, there's no change in the sense that we -- and we talked about this before, but for the longest time, our sort of calling card in the underwriting world was this thing called ITAC, which is the internal transactional Affirm credit score. And that allowed us to do really precise underwriting at the transactional level. Some number of quarters ago, we have augmented that with a user credit score which allows us to underwrite both sort of a more holistic consumer in addition to every individual traction. We still underwrite every transaction, we still reserve the right to say we cannot lend money to you. but we have a score that we feel very good about in our ability to say what's the overall capacity to borrow and pay us back and willingness to do so. And we lend on the card and off the card using the same set of scores and the same set of variables and limits. And so you can borrow from Affirm using an integrated point-of-sale solution you can borrow on the card with two different modalities of borrowing on the card, but all of it goes against the same set of variables and the same set of observed behaviors that governs our ability to approve the next transaction. The thing that's created about the card is that it's optimized for convenience in everything like multi-land checkout environments all the way to online shopping. So it's an expansion of opportunity, but not an expansion of our willingness to take on more risk I think that answers it, but I'm happy to provide a lot more details if you like.\nMichael Linford: I think the other thing to say is I don't think we're anywhere near the limits on what we think we would think about exposure limits for these users and we're nowhere near some sort of cap there for the population. We think there's a lot of frequency that we can drive with the existing users.\nJames Faucette: Yeah. Great. Appreciate that. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Hecht: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Like, just thinking about kind of the appetite for selling versus retaining the loans that you guys generated this year, I mean, you have interest rate, at least the curve is going down. It looks like sales execution is getting better, but you guys had an ABS transaction, I think, yesterday and the execution there was good. So how do we just think about kind of balance sheet movement versus marketplace movement over the course of the year?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we did price an ABS deal, and we did so at an all-in cost of capital, 100 basis points lower than a deal we did in December. So in a very short period of time, you're seeing the market really give us credit for that. And that, we think, is a really healthy sign for the capital system and ecosystem overall. And we think is a reflection of both an improved macro outlook for everybody, but for us, more specifically, the disciplined approach to credit that we've taken over the past year is getting valued we think, in the debt capital markets. And so we feel very strong about that. When we do the revolving ABS deals like the one we just did our 248 (ph) deal, those do end up on the balance sheet. And so while we do think about that as a really important funding channel, it isn't off balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet strategies involve mostly selling whole loans, although we do some non-revolving some term securitizations. With respect to the whole loan sales, we feel really excited about both the existing partners expanding and the pipeline of new opportunities that we have. Those conversations have gone very well. I think very consistent with the reaction that the ABS market has had. There's real value being given to us for the kind of credit outcomes that we've driven. And frankly, the yield that we put into the asset has allowed us to continue to be able to sell at prices that aren't really good for us. As is always the case, and we've said since day 1, we don't have one strategy that's better than the other. The things that we do are first and foremost, enable the growth in the business, and I'm extremely proud of the way the team has been able to support the capital program over the past year through all the volatility remaining enabling all the growth that we've delivered. The second priority is to deliver our unit economics. Clearly, if weâ€™re running the 3% to 4% range like we did this past quarter, we feel very strong about that. And then we begin to want to manage the capital efficiency of the program. Thatâ€™s the third piece. And obviously, whole loan sales are more efficient but itâ€™s the third of the three priorities. And so we wouldnâ€™t really want to overuse that lever. And then the last comment is each of our capital strategies really exists and reinforce one another. And so you really wonâ€™t see us pivot to one or the other. Weâ€™re going to continue to scale all of our channels. That means continued ABS execution, continued forward flow and continued use of our warehouse lines.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. My other question was asked and answered, and I appreciate the color. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Barker: Thanks for taking my questions. So there was a little bit of a tick up in the net charge-off rate in the quarter. It seems like you built reserves last quarter that may have preempted the charge-off coming through or could be partially seasonality as well. Is there anything to point out there? And would you expect that charge-off rate to drift lower just given you're seeing a larger portion of GMV being driven by Affirm card? Thanks.\nMichael Linford: No. I don't think the card is going to drive different credit outcomes for the whole portfolio. I think the level of repeat usage might where you do see better credit outcomes on repeat users overall, but I don't think the card is big enough really to affect the total portfolio numbers yet. Obviously, when it gets much larger, it will begin to have a more material impact. But for now, I think it's small enough and yes, there's really nothing to point to specifically on the charge-offs. Again, I think about our charge-off policy, we charge off at 120 days. Delinquencies once they get to past 60 or 90 days are overwhelmingly likely to go towards charge-offs. So we have a pretty good sense of that and full allowance at all times to handle the future charge-offs that we estimate.\nKevin Barker: I think you mentioned that you were leaning in a little bit last quarter. Are you opening up the credit box to attract more users. It seems like it's an opportune time to do that just given your acceleration here and profitability that's being generated?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. I think the strong units give us permission to do that more than anything. So we talked about 3% to 4% in the revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV. Thatâ€™s the real constraint for us. And so if weâ€™re in that range, we can continue to be very aggressive on acquiring and reengaging new users. And thatâ€™s really the constraint much more so than anything else.\nKevin Barker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ng: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, a housekeeping question. Could you just help explain the uptick in the merchant fee rates for the long core zeros and are there any initiatives or mix dynamics that may affect that going forward? And then second, just a bigger picture question. Transactions per active have obviously been growing 4.4% this last quarter. You're also seeing really strong repeat customers. What does that tell you about the loyalty or engagement of customers and the durability about the installed base of users? Are these customers using this because it's become more habitual and it's a better experience or is it out of a necessity of credit? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: So on the first question, it really is just a function of the mix in our business. And that's always been true for merchant rates. We always talk about merchant fee rates as being mix driven. That's why we began breaking it out in the supplement. The slight tick-up you see on one of the categories is really just a function of mix within that category, but also as duration goes up, so does the price, especially in this rate environment, where it's pretty duration sensitive in terms of the price you charge. I don't -- again, I don't think there's a broader trend to be read into there. And on the frequency question, I'll let Max answer that.\nMax Levchin: I think it's a reflection of the fact that the product is becoming more widely available more than anything. I think as we sign up some of the partnerships and expand them, the Shopify reference I made earlier, it does result in wider availability. The product is popular. It's well liked by the users. One of our top questions in customer service is why isn't Brand X supporting Affirm right now, and we work very hard to make sure there are fewer and fewer of those. And so as we become more available, also as we become available offline in the form of the card as well as some of the integrations that we've done, you'll naturally see more transactional velocity and frequency increase. The product is a better product in my highly biased opinion than that of a credit card and credit utilization goes up broadly, I think we are the under beneficiaries of that usage given the chance or choice, consumers opt in for more Affirm spend than private card spend and they're rewarded by having no late fees, no compounding interest, all the good things that would bring.\nMichael Ng: Thanks, Max. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Bauch: Hey. Thanks for taking question. Excuse me, if this has already been asked, but I just want to get an update on what you've seen with a Affirm card usage. And anything that surprised you another three months into its evolution around behaviors or categories? Just anything broadly around that would be great.\nMax Levchin: It's going really well. You can see in the supplement that we are continuing to grow it. From my point of view, for what it's worth, we're growing it cautiously for a couple of good reasons. One, it's a new mode of operation, which means that the downstream services such as customer service, dispute resolution, merchant disputes, et cetera, also has to scale. So we're going to grow it deliberately for a little while longer before we feel that we've learned all the important muscle memories of how to handle various conflicts that inevitably occur in commerce, et cetera. And so we feel very good about the growth. We have many, many more turns on potentially increasing that. In terms of surprises, things all generally gone to plan, there is plenty more to do on reasons to use the card more often. We talked about at the investor event last year were dangerously close to actually making good on it. We have reward programs in mind that give people reasons to use the card for all transactions, not just considered purchases. There's plenty to do with tight integration between Affirm card and Affirm account, which we've done a couple of things with, but there's still more features to come. And so -- and from my point of view, the card is still very, very early. There's just a long road map of things to do there, both on the frequency of use basis as well as modalities of making sure that consumers really understand the full power that it brings. And then once we feel that, that's really all figured out, we have a lot more growth to enable there when we see that is the right now to do it.\nAndrew Bauch: And is that next leg of growth just a function of then you finally get the green light to put the extra leg of sales and marketing dollars into the card and to the -- really the solution in order to kind of find that next leg of growth or is it just moving further into the [indiscernible].\nMax Levchin: It's really -- there's -- I don't anticipate any marketing dollars allocated towards distributing the card in any foreseeable future. It's not any budget. That is not how it's going to get grown. And so today, to get the card, you have to have been in a Affirm transactor before. You have to be in good standing, you have to be fairly far down the affirmed journey and then you have to react to one of the -- no, fairly visible sort of adverts when we say, hey, do you want to use the Affirm card? We really think you should try it, you're eligible. So we've marketed it without too much restraints, although it's still being kept to a higher credit quality standard than the overall Affirm. So we're still tilting the scale a little bit in our favor in terms of consumers that get the card offers are not quite at the same level of cutoff as everybody else. And so that's one obvious way of opening up the funnel. But you can imagine a much more aggressive approach for example, right now, you have a choice between taking out a loan on a onetime virtual card number or you can go down the remote of applying for a card. Obviously, taking away the former will naturally increase the latter. So there are several non-dramatic with meaningful levels of growth that we have chosen not to pull on just yet. And then ultimately, if you sign up for Affirm, at some point, you just got to get a card. And that's certainly not a thing we're going to do tomorrow, but that is a meaningful trajectory change.\nAndrew Bauch: So it still sounds like it's going to be pretty targeted for a while here. Great. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Not forecasting any time that stops or goes, but I feel very good about the card growth for now.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Zane Keller for closing comments.\nZane Keller: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Hosting todayâ€™s call with me are Max Levchin, Affirmâ€™s founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirmâ€™s Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin todayâ€™s call, we would like to remind investors that we will be holding an investor forum next Tuesday, November 14th, from 2 to 5 pm Eastern Time. Both the livecast of the forum as well as a replay are open to the public. Additional details about the forum, including registration information, are available on our Investor Relations website. In line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into questions and answers. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I keep it very brief. We had a very strong fiscal Q1, exceeded our outlook across all metrics. GMV growth accelerated sequentially. We significantly exceeded our own outlook for revenue less transaction costs. We continued to gain market share, kept our already strong economics quite good, drove positive credit outcomes, which matters to us the most, and added some funding capacity. Our plans now include continuing to invest in risk management, technology and product development, and to turn our attention to growing Affirm faster. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller : Thank you, Max. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. And congrats on the solid results. Just thinking about -- we head into the second quarter here, given the outperformance in the first, especially in GMV and volume. What kind of led to the outperformance? And then, it looks like the growth rate will decelerate back a little bit after accelerating this quarter in the second quarter, maybe you can just help us with that? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: I think, Iâ€™ll take the why the growth. I think weâ€™ve just been executing really well. As you saw just the overall operating leverage, we are firing in all pistons of the Company, which it feels very good. Weâ€™re able to deliver a couple of really key initiatives on the product side. Our friends in Ottawa, in particular, we had several really strong ideas that played out very well for us there. And so Shopify volume accelerated again, which sort of speaks to maybe the way we operate the business. It sometimes seems like you signed a great partner and thatâ€™s the burst of volume. But in reality, it takes us years to fully realize the opportunity for us when partnerships are this rich and with this much potential. So thatâ€™s one example. Card grew quite well as well and so weâ€™re happy with those results. Thereâ€™s not one thing that I can stick a finger at and say that this is the core reason for the GMV growth. But the other thing is that the demand for the product remains strong. We are still declining quite a number of applicants, because weâ€™re trying to remain as thoughtful and productive in our credit outcomes, but the consumer demand for what we have to offer is continuing to pull it forward.\nMichael Linford: The only thing Iâ€™d comment on for Q2 is, itâ€™s our largest quarter of the year. And so, we just have a lot more math in the comparable period. And we do expect that some of our programs, our largest enterprise partner programs are continuing to mature in a way that we just expect a little bit less growth this year than we had in the last quarter.\nBryan Keane: And then just as a quick follow-up, Michael, maybe you can talk a little bit about adjusted operating profit came in quite a bit ahead of expectations. Is that some timing of expense items that even out throughout the year, or anything to call out there for the margin in the first quarter versus for the quarters for the rest of the year?\nMichael Linford: Yes. The adjusted operating income did come in well ahead of where we thought it was going to be for the quarter. And I think it shows the power of us and our technology orientation. When we are able to control expenses and drive a little bit of extra growth, the growth and profitability is very, very strong. And to put it in context, we have 28% GMV growth or 37% revenue growth and our non-transaction operating expenses reduced on an absolute basis by $50 million year-on-year. When that happens, obviously, you can print pretty strong results. I think due to our outperformance, we did raise the outlook for the full year. Weâ€™re now expecting closer to 5%. And I think that we were driving leverage really across all three lines, G&A, sales and marketing, and tech data and analytics. And those lines are all very leverageable in our business. Weâ€™ve been saying this for quite some time. And yet thatâ€™s also the area we invest in, primarily in human capital. We want to make sure we maintain the ability to invest in the back half of the year, which is why we wouldnâ€™t expect to run at this level. But no, there really wasnâ€™t any sort of timing benefit. We will expect sales and marketing to creep up a little bit in Q2 as we invest into the holiday season. But other than that, we feel like Q1 was very close to run rate before we again maintain some -- bring to make some investments in the back half of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: I just have two. First, as a follow-up to the first question around Shop Pay Installments GMV growth acceleration. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what functionally changes or ramps up over time that allows you to drive this acceleration in GMV over two years since the initial partnership? And what can that tell us about how you approach some of these enterprise partnerships? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nMax Levchin: Iâ€™m known to give long winded answers, so Iâ€™ll actually try to keep this one shorter. The very short hand answer is optimization. Both companies are very numerically driven. We spend an incredible amount of energy just EV testing, various forms of presentation of the products we offer to consumers, try to simplify things, try to fine-tune everything from how do we explain interest if thereâ€™s interest to pay. How do we make sure people understand that there is no interest in products like paying for. Just all of that. And if you have a -- one of the sort of obvious truisms if you will is if you have a significant amount of volume already, even 1% or 2% increase in end to end conversion just creates millions or tens of millions of dollars of incremental GMV. So itâ€™s never a -- sometimes it is sort of a brilliant unlock where we say, oh, we forgot this thing we can try and it works, but 9 out of 10 times itâ€™s really just optimizing existing consumer experience, finding ways of presenting the offer a little bit more up funnel so consumer understands there is a budget perhaps more than the budget they realize because we can tell them hereâ€™s what we are willing to approve you for et cetera. And then, just doing that over and over again has compounding effects. So, thereâ€™s not a -- the secret sauce is in the work, not in secret.\nMichael Ng: And then maybe just a quick one on Affirm Card, $224 million of GMV, accelerating from the $130 million last quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about how youâ€™re approaching driving growth there? The user growth seemed like it was steady at that $75,000 per month? And anything you could tell us around the mix of Affirm Card GMV and how that may have changed relative to last quarter? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: So I donâ€™t want to steal too much of Liborâ€™s show next week, to quote my favorite movie, Iâ€™d love all of you to come and give me notes when we do investor forum a week from now. But the shorthand is, the mix remained largely in line with what we said last quarter. Itâ€™s still more split pay -- or split transactions versus paid in full. Weâ€™ll talk a lot about things like cohort retention and usage over time and a little bit about lifetime value next week. So, thereâ€™s a lot to share, and I donâ€™t want spoil the party too much. The growth is quite strong. It is managed to the number that we want. We have internal goals that we are driving card numbers to. We wonâ€™t run out of opportunities there for some time. We also want to make sure that we donâ€™t paint ourselves into a corner in the following sense. The product is a new idea. This is not something that existed before. We have lots of intellectual property protection around some of the stuff that we invented both kind of what meets the eye and whatâ€™s under the hood there. And every time you launch a new product, even if it has exceptional uptake, which we think this one does, you are educating a consumer. You have to look for long-term effects. Like, one of my many nighttime jobs is to read consumer feedback that comes to me directly from the card and itâ€™s now a very steady stream of content. And a lot of it is about sort of getting in touch with our PMs and saying, hey, thereâ€™s this wrinkle on the card that people still donâ€™t fully understand, how do we fix this? Again, so in service of that, letâ€™s get 3% more conversion, letâ€™s get 5% more conversion. The card is so new, every time we find some major comprehension unlock, we find ourselves in another 10% gain. So, itâ€™s gratifying to unblock -- fix a mistake we made or unblock a comprehension detail and suddenly lot more volume. So, weâ€™ll continue growing users quite deliberately. Weâ€™ll be very, very focused on unblocking all the quirks of these interface, doing all the educating that we have to do before we start sending a card to everybody as they sign up. But over the long period of time, I fully expect to get to a place that is, hey, welcome to Affirm, the cardâ€™s in the mail. Thatâ€™s not going to happen anytime in the immediate or even foreseeable future. But the long-term point of the card is, it is the best way of experiencing Affirm. We will build all of our product roadmaps on this idea of you should have this card, it is the best thing ever and you should just have one of these, even if youâ€™ve transacted with Affirm for the first time yesterday.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Dolev of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results. So proud. Max, the B2B initiatives in the Amazon partnership, I think it was last week, got a lot of excitement and a lot of press. Can you maybe tell us what makes you so excited about this, kind of the opportunity, sizing it and maybe talking whether or not thereâ€™ll be other B2B partners? And then, I have a very quick follow-up. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Dan. We are very proud too, but I really appreciate hearing that. The team works very hard. I know a bunch of Affirm folks are listening. You nailed it this quarter. Thank you for your hard work. The B2B thing that we started showing is certainly not a one-off. In fact, when we start reviewing the opportunity, my ask to the team was please come back to me with a plan of what this looks like in a market, sort of whatâ€™s the true opportunity across many, many possible platforms, not just one. So yes, you should expect us to do more. Obviously, we will speak to it when weâ€™re good and ready. The current product as you see it today is for sole proprietorships. And itâ€™s this interesting space where the efficiency of the lending market to that user is really, really poor. And so, as a result, the consumer typically borrows money either on their personal financial devices, which is just for a variety of reasons a bad idea, or through all kinds of just unoptimized old school sort of 19th century lending platforms. And thereâ€™s no reason why that should be this way, given our expertise and underwriting, in particular underwriting consumers. So expanding our models to small, very small full proprietorship type business underwriting was not a huge challenge. The actual work began something like more than a year ago where we primarily just tested will our underwriting work as well as it does in consumer if we expanded it to very small businesses. And obviously, we feel confident enough to start rolling it out with the largest e-commerce player. So, feel very positive about it. Weâ€™ll be very deliberate. Itâ€™s a new business for us. Nothing is -- we will not do anything that damages our stellar credit performance. Thatâ€™s certainly, as always job number one, but exciting. Thereâ€™s lots of merchants that have very sizable side hustles, if you will, where they sell their goods or goods on their platform to sell props that either use them or resell them and they too need some honest financial services and here we are for that.\nDan Dolev: Thatâ€™s super helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up for you or for Michael. I mean, I was - what caught my eye in the shareholder letter was the ability to sustain 3% to 4% revenue less transaction costs. We all know that with the key pushback from clients that we were talking to. It sounds like you guys have figured out a way to -- for this not to be a problem anymore. So maybe just kind of walk us a little bit through sort of the path to making sure that this 3% to 4% is sustainable even in a higher for longer environment. Thank you, again.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Weâ€™re really proud that we were towards the high end of our long-term range in a quarter when we were obviously up against substantially lower rate environment, and we feel like weâ€™re settling into the higher for longer. I think thereâ€™s maybe two things to call out. The first is that weâ€™ve done a really good job of making sure our assets have the right economic content in them. In our letter, we do plot what the yield of our asset is and also where our funding costs have gone. And you can see that, certainly youâ€™ll see a pretty big inflection towards the end on the Affirm asset yield, and thatâ€™s a reflection of our pricing initiatives but also the really strong credit controls that weâ€™ve had place over the past year. And it all starts there, you got to get the asset yield right, but then the second piece is really important is weâ€™ve been executing really well in the capital markets. We have added forward flow partners to the mix, which of course helps the imperative earning power as you can sell loans and earn the gain on sale, which is really important for us to do. And maybe notably is that the percentage of loans sold in our first quarter was more in line with the historical averages than we had been in the prior quarter, which was a pretty depressed level. And so, what youâ€™re seeing is the benefit of the improvement to the asset yield and the benefit of the capital markets execution, which in turn is a benefit of the discipline that weâ€™ve had on the asset yield, right? Those two things are very much linked. And youâ€™re seeing it really shine right now where our engagement with capital markets partners is really positive. Max mentioned that we went and saw many folks over the past couple of months, and the discipline that weâ€™ve had is really giving us credit there. And so, thatâ€™s what gives us confidence that this rate environment is one that we can operate well in. Weâ€™ve done the work to get the asset yields that they need to be. Weâ€™re getting credit for it in the capital market. And our focus is really around, at this point, continuing to scale the network, weâ€™ve earned the right to do that.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Bauch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bauch: Just wanted to ask a general state of the consumer kind of question. I know that the student loan forgiveness or forbearance is coming due. And so, any kind of updated thoughts on how you think that impacts overall demand? And then, maybe like a higher level question. As macro is deteriorating, I mean has deteriorated, and in the past, youâ€™ve said that there is a reasonable possibility that BNPL becomes a more preferred payment method, in more challenging economic times. Just trying to get a sense of have things kind of played out the way that you had anticipated in both of those opportunities.\nMax Levchin: A lot to go there. So, on the student loan, thatâ€™s an easy one. So we said it for two quarters in a row before this one, we too got very seriously. Obviously, nobody had sort of real sense for exactly what it would look like. I gave Dan props last quarter because he really something that predicted pretty precisely what we thought would happen to student loan repayment, impact on our ability to approve people. And the point is weâ€™ve been looking at it for months and months and months and incorporated underwriting changes to make sure we are prepared for the student loan repayment resumption. At this point, theyâ€™ve been effectively back, the obligations for a month and a little bit. We feel that weâ€™ve handled it really well. We can see it in our credit prints that it had no material impact on us. In fact, the slight increase that we saw was seasonality exactly as we predicted. So, we did a really good job preparing for that and largely think itâ€™s behind us. I think just more broadly, that has been our strength as a company. We take underwriting as the single most important thing we cannot make a mistake on. And we obsess over it. We look at all the metrics all the time. We call five alarm fires every time, some metric -- ever so slightly off to make sure that we know exactly why it is. And thatâ€™s what has allowed us to maintain this level of performance in credit. Iâ€™m not sure I agree that the economy has deteriorated. Thatâ€™s a very broad statement. There are definitely signs of stress going back as far as April of 2022. Itâ€™s, generally speaking, for our consumer not been a dramatic change in their ability to pay their bills back because -- remains effectively fully employed. Obviously, the most recent unemployment numbers start to show some very modest cracks in the full employment number, but still very, very strong relative to what we would consider to be serious area of concern. And we tune our models to both internally sourced data of actual repayments and the macroeconomic inputs such as job prints is what we consider as we try to forecast the not very distant future. The reason we donâ€™t need to forecast the very distant future is because the terms of our loans are really, really short. So, we have to be right about whatâ€™s going to happen to our consumer in the near-term much more than we have to predict the world economic future. As far as the BNPL popularity, weâ€™re certainly seeing a stronger demand as we had seen in points of time. It does help that we are the only player of scale that is willing to write monthly installment loans. The paying for was a pretty cool idea when it was all fun and games and zero interest rates to underwrite people for 6 months loan and 12 months loans, you have to be quite a bit more detail oriented and thoughtful in our modeling and that is our strength and the source of our overall superiority. We feel very good about our ability to continue performing in those loans as well as the shorter term stuff. It seems that offering the full spectra of products really does drive consumer preference, but obviously still a very, very competitive market and weâ€™re not going to declare victory just yet. But it does seem that the BNPL has remained a consumer favorite. Certainly, the Affirm version of BNPL remained a consumer favorite, given as the economic party may have gotten a little bit cooler.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: I know the shareholder letter mentioned that youâ€™ve seen some disparate GMV trends among some of the various categories that you serve. So, Iâ€™m wondering just as you look at the guide -- the updated guide for fiscal â€˜24, are you assuming any material change in the more discretionary categories?\nMichael Linford: No, weâ€™re really not. So as per the usual, we try to hold what weâ€™re seeing right now when we provide our guidance. And we donâ€™t really assume things are going to get materially better or worse because we really donâ€™t try to prognosticate too much about where the economy is going. We do see some positive trends right now. Youâ€™re seeing categories that were real decliners over the couple of quarters returned to something that looks more like flat, certainly less decline. And we think thatâ€™s a good healthy sign. And obviously, we still have exposure to some of the largest platforms in e-commerce, and that does -- that breadth of exposure allows us to get pretty wide category coverage. And so, the more operative question for us is, are consumers going to be out spending, and we certainly feel like the evidence is right now that they are.\nJason Kupferberg: Max, you touched briefly on decline rates. And Iâ€™m just wondering if youâ€™ve seen any notable change in those decline rates, not just in terms of this year, percent of loan requests that youâ€™re declining. But just how that might vary across different slices of your demographic, or are you seeing certain consumers coming back with more loan requests more frequently?\nMax Levchin: Iâ€™ll start by reminding that decline for us is kind of the point of last resort. So, for a huge percentage of underwriting decisions, what we try to do and do pretty well is say, yes and, and is we need you to make a down-payment. We think that you should borrow, not $800 for example, but $600. And if you have [$200] to make a down-payment, that will be wonderful. And so thatâ€™s just an important thing to keep in mind. So, when sort of -- we look at our approval rates, theyâ€™ve largely remained broadly the same. Obviously between sort of groups of consumers if you stratify them by credit, they generally remain the same. But by definition, the credit mix, the input mix has not really changed all that much. So very broadly, the answer is no, weâ€™re not seeing anything dramatic. The one thing thatâ€™s really -- that we have to mention, so we said it last quarter that weâ€™re on track to broadened our EPR range from 0% to 36%. Obviously before we were between 0% and 30% as we broadened it to 36%. The natural consequence of that is weâ€™re able to approve a little bit more books. And that is a great tool to have. Obviously, the number one job that we have vis-Ã -vis consumers is to offer them access to credit in a transparent fairly priced way. Having a wider range of prices available to us does allow us to say yes to more people. So, all these to people -- youâ€™ll see us probably on the margin be slightly more approveful, if thatâ€™s a new word. I made that up. I thought Iâ€™d start a word go. But, being able to price the risk in allows us to say yes more often.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wildhack: I wanted to ask about the higher allowance quarter-over-quarter, maybe follow-on from that last question. Can you speak to the drivers there? And then, given the short duration that youâ€™re emphasizing, Iâ€™m curious the degree to which you think of changes in the allowance as proactive, i.e., we receive credit versus reactive, i.e., things kind of started looking worse than we expected?\nMichael Linford: Itâ€™s definitely not reactive, meaning things look worse. Itâ€™s very mathematical for us. So, we make an estimate of the losses for all loans we have on the balance sheet at any point in time and we make sure that we have an allowance appropriate to support that. As you change the mix of on- and off-balance sheet a quarter-over-quarter, so the increase in sold loans does drive the math to be higher this period, given the fact that youâ€™re selling more early stage loans. And so, you naturally have a little bit of shift there. But we donâ€™t view that as a bad thing. Itâ€™s certainly not a reflection of underlying credit performance. We think the underlying credit performance remains exactly where weâ€™d like it to be. And when we have the kind of unit economics that we have this quarter, which is really strong at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, obviously, weâ€™re very comfortable with the amount of provision needed to support the growth in allowance.\nRob Wildhack: And then, maybe one on the regulatory front. The CFPB has been pretty active with respect to buy now, pay later and even fintech more broadly. So what are your latest thoughts on their role? And then how do you see that evolving going forward? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Yes. So weâ€™ve always viewed them as one of our key regulators. Iâ€™ve spent a fair amount of time on their advisory board a few years ago, so on. So obviously being subject to supervision from our point of view is a formalization of the relationship between Affirm and bureau. We think we may be somewhat unique in this, but we think itâ€™s a positive step for the industry, most importantly, sort of normalizes the engagement with the regulatory bodies. Itâ€™s also good for consumers for obvious reasons and good for us because we think it levels the playing field in quite a number of centers. Weâ€™ve been in contact with the bureau for a long, long time and certainly expect to continue being engaged with them. Our priorities remain exactly what they have been. We are everything, if not transparent and clear with the end borrower and that certainly aligns very well with the mission of the bureau. So, I feel -- generally speaking, feel quite good about the regulatory engagement.\nOperator: The next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape in general. It seems like the stability and the merchant fee rates that you guys lay out in the slide presentation points to a pretty rational environment there, but you mentioned taking some market share. How are your conversations with merchants going -- merchant partners going and how is this sales pipeline kind of progressing in that context? \nMax Levchin: Itâ€™s more rational now than it was before. I wouldnâ€™t call it fully rational just yet. I think itâ€™s harder -- with every passing moment, so long as we agree that the overall economic reality is not on a positive direction. And as I said in a previous question, we have not seen sort of a dramatic turn for the worse, but we are very, very active in managing credit. It is a competitive advantage for us and I think, if Iâ€™m completely honest, itâ€™s a bit of a soft spot for some of the competition. And so, what this does to merchants, if our competitors are rational, is they have to tighten approval dramatically. They canâ€™t separate risk as well as we can. The only way to not have losses is just decline indiscriminately a lot more. Our strength is ability to separate good and bad risk and therefore we can maintain high approvals. That has served us really, really well over the years. Thereâ€™s lots of stories to tell from the earliest days of Affirm where some extremely valuable logo merchant would come to us and say well, the competitor of your just showed up and they offered us half the price, so weâ€™re going to clue you and go there. And during those times, I would sort of stress and worry that this means everything is broken about this company, and we always maintained with much urging and occasional head slapping from Michael. We maintained a discipline of saying, look, if this is an irrational deal, we will not sign it. And most often those merchants would come back to us and say, actually the weirdest thing happened, we are paying a much lower price, but the approvals suck. And itâ€™s not an accident. If you are good at managing risk, you know how to price it, and if you know how to price it, you can then deliver it at a fair price to both the consumer and the merchant. And so, as it becomes a little bit harder or for some folks obviously a lot harder to underwrite, itâ€™s a little bit easier to prove to our partners that being rational on a pricing side is really important. So, this conversation will become a little bit easier. To sort of break it down even more and I promise Iâ€™ll stop in a second, but itâ€™s an obviously super important topic that I spent a fair amount of time on. The thing that really becomes interesting is you talk to folks that run these merchant companies and some of them are still very, very focused on bottom line, others are on top line, and sometimes itâ€™s a function of having inventory, sometimes itâ€™s a function of trying to meet growth targets for investing purposes. Depending on that, their goals change. And the thing that weâ€™re really, really good at is tuning financial offers for consumers to meet merchantsâ€™ financial targets. If they are if the merchant is very focused on driving inventory out of the warehouse or off their virtual shelves, weâ€™re very good at creating consumer offers at no APR, fixed low APR that we can dynamically price for the merchant and the consumer and make those transactions happen. If the merchant is very focused on their own bottom line, weâ€™re very comfortable working with them to reduce or to drive their MDRs down to make sure that their costs are under huge degree of control and passing the cost on to the consumer. Because we are so transparent with pricing to both sides, itâ€™s never a mystery and never this sort of a black box negotiation where everybody feels like theyâ€™ve been somehow hurt by this whole process. Weâ€™re very, very clear with our merchants. Hereâ€™s exactly what you can get in the current environment with the current approvals. And over the years, thatâ€™s built a reputation for us that just worked time and time again. And so, the conversations have always been rational with the merchants that we have and thatâ€™s why you see our MDRs quite stable and our merchant base quite well retained.\nMichael Linford: A couple of things just to add. The market will continue to be competitive. This is a growing category for a reason. Consumers are seeking out alternatives. And so we expect the market to continue to be competitive. We expect to continue to be rational in the face of competitors who want to be less rational, but we expect competition. And then, to specifically answer your question around the pipeline, we donâ€™t disclose any pipeline stats, but we feel good about the level of commercial activity right now. Thereâ€™s lots of great conversations happening and we remain, in conversations today that we probably couldnâ€™t have had a few years ago given some of the irrationality. So, we think thatâ€™s a good thing, but those are conversations in pipeline, so thereâ€™s certainly nothing concrete there.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic. And then, a quick follow-up for me. In the shareholder letter, you mentioned some improvements at checkout with Affirm at brick and mortar, big box partner and also I think expanding the partnership with Verifone. How should we think about that physical opportunity, the brick and mortar opportunity? And does that kind of change now with Affirm Card in terms of how youâ€™re thinking about monetizing sort of the physical transaction, or are there still -- is there still another leg potentially that you can develop here by perfecting that physical Affirm at checkout experience?\nMax Levchin: You must have been spying on our conversation with Michael yesterday. Jokes aside. Yes, the short answer is absolutely, weâ€™ve been caged in this e-commerce cage for a very long time and feel very good about our -- breaking out into the bigger wide open commerce space writ large. Affirm works pretty well in store if the merchant is cooperating. So depending on where you go youâ€™ll find us in a kiosk, you will find us on your phone, but speaking to the phone of a store associate. Thereâ€™s a bunch of modalities that weâ€™ve developed over the years. And they all work fairly well for existing users. And if the merchant helps, they can even help us with user acquisition. The card just supercharges this thing like a totally different level. Again, Iâ€™m going to bite my tongue on some of the cool stats, I think weâ€™re going to show off next week, but weâ€™ll talk a little bit about the success weâ€™re seeing offline with the card. But even beyond that, we do think that thereâ€™s work to be done, ideas to be tried offline, even before the consumer gets the card, and thatâ€™s a pretty exciting thing. At this point, as Michael put it yesterday, Wi-Fi or cell coverage in a store next to a store to solve problem. And we do have a 80%-ish app download for existing users and a very, very high propensity to download our app just because the brand and the app reviews have been so strong. So feel very good about what weâ€™ll do offline. It is brick and mortar, which means that it moves a little bit slower, but the price is worth the effort.\nOperator: The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: A couple of follow-up questions on things youâ€™ve already talked about, Max and Michael. First, in terms of like the engagement with the merchants and that kind of thing. Iâ€™m wondering how active your conversations are beyond just kind of making available to them what theyâ€™re -- what they could do from a promotional perspective on interest rates, et cetera? And the reason I ask is because in the period of rising interest rates and kind of normalizing retail activity, I would have thought we would have seen a bit more 0% promotional activity on the part of merchant partners to date and maybe Iâ€™m just missing it, et cetera, or its impact on your financials so far, but just wondering what that process looks like.\nMax Levchin: Thatâ€™s certainly a major part of the conversation. I think I sort of started answering this and Michael has a lot of opinion on this one, so Iâ€™ll call him in a second. But the shorthand is it really depends on the merchant margin structure. If your overall world view is co-points to margin, lots of turns of inventory, you just donâ€™t have the margin capacity to drive these 0% deals unless the manufacturer is willing to contribute. And weâ€™ve sort of dropped the breadcrumbs of that idea for quite some time and obviously itâ€™s a massive sales and engineering effort where youâ€™re trying to tie more than just the consumer and the seller, but also consumer and the seller and a manufacturer or brand or some other third-party that wants to subsidize the interest. So, thatâ€™s a fun design and engineering challenge, but weâ€™ve been making very, very steady progress. Thereâ€™s a sort of a point in my letter about what we internally call mixed carts, which I think I referenced as the ability to combine multiple financing programs. If you have a manufacturer or brand thatâ€™s sponsoring a 0% deal, letâ€™s say itâ€™s a TV manufacturer and youâ€™re buying that TV and a bag of cookies and the cookies are not 0% sponsored, you have to be able to provide correct accounting for both sides of the transaction, but consumer think of it as a single basket. And so before we got to full distribution of the brand sponsor promotions as we call them, we have to deploy robust implementation of mixed cart accounting and sort of downstream transactional and capital markets work. So, that took us a fair amount of time and effort just to sign as to how complex some of this stuff can be. Now that we have that that live, we have a variety of really rich conversations around, hey, letâ€™s have a 0% promotion and no, you donâ€™t have to directly fund the EPR discount, Mr. Merchant. So thatâ€™s one side of it. If your margin structure is, I got 60% gross margin and maybe a subscription to support future revenue streams, of course, you want to do 0% deals and that becomes a much, much easier conversation. So we have merchants of both kinds and everything in between. We work pretty closely with them. As the holidays roll along, people start becoming very concerned with driving inventory off the shelves, sometimes into the holidays, sometimes right after depending on sort of what they think will happen to them or what does happen to them around five days of sales around Thanksgiving, and so weâ€™ll certainly support all those, but a big part of who we are is weâ€™re fundamentally an engineering company, and so building these tools is what we enjoy the most. As we ship new tools, we immediately bring them to market to our merchant partners, offering them new ways of driving more sales. And so, we have quite a lot of fun stuff that we shipped in the last 60, 90 days and all of that will get deployed and into the holidays.\nMichael Linford: The only thing Iâ€™d add is, we have been intentional around introducing fixed APR offers. This is low APRs, I think 5% and 10% APR offers into the merchant base. And those serve, the same -- the promotional role that is 0% served in a 0% rate environment. And I think those have been well received and have consumed a lot. And then lastly, I just -- thereâ€™s a merchant mix here that matters a lot in this conversation. The merchant platforms that are stealing the most right now have the most interest bearing mix. And I think that probably distorts the trend I think youâ€™re pulling on, which is a little bit below the surface and overwhelmed by just the mix across our merchant base. So as you sell less exercise bikes and you sell more general merchandise that those trends tend to play out that way.\nJames Faucette: And then separately on Debit+ and the like. How are you seeing -- clearly like youâ€™re seeing a pickup in GMV and frequency of use, et cetera. How is that use tracking versus your expectation of people using it for debit type transactions versus some sort of credit generating transaction? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Thatâ€™s definitely the star of the show next week. So, Iâ€™ll give you a light preview versus the very wholesome presentation, which you should expect next week. Generally speaking, itâ€™s tracking two expectations. What youâ€™ll hear a bunch about next week is itâ€™s becoming a very clear journey where we are teaching consumers about a new product. When they just sign up for the cards -- so these are all repeat consumers. Theyâ€™re not -- weâ€™ve never spent a penny marketing the card. Thereâ€™s no big billboards over one-on-one or anything like that. Itâ€™s just the card that you get if you like Affirm and we offer it to you and we -- we havenâ€™t pushed it particularly hard just yet. When you do get it, the first sort of comprehension hurdle is, hey, this is just like Affirm where I ask for a loan and I get approved and it works. But now it works, I can consummate the transaction with a card. So your first intellectual hurdle is, itâ€™s Affirm on a piece of plastic, thatâ€™s cool. So, you canâ€™t expect that to become your daily spending instrument because Affirm today is for everything from dresses to fancy workout equipment, but itâ€™s not in your mind just yet for a cup of coffee. Over time you see folks slowly recognize that actually itâ€™s pretty cool. It provides some buyer protection, unlike your debit card. It has a bunch of really neat features like you can say, oh, this transaction is actually a little bit more than I wanted to spend. I can go back in time and split it, if thatâ€™s appropriate. And so, as people understand all the functionality of the card, which is not something that they pick up in a day or two, it actually - we have a whole bunch of work that we put in. This quarter -- if you have used the card before, you kind of missed out on a whole bunch of really neat things that we shipped as a first time user experience through the whole pile of features helping people understand all the various things that are capable of. We start graduating people to more and more transactions and Iâ€™ll bite my tongue on some of the really cool reveals. But we have -- so the tip of the spear the consumers that really get at how it works are tracking better than expectations. Iâ€™m very, very excited about that group. And our job is really now taking the customer through, hey, this is Affirm card to -- this is actually something I could use instead of my debit card. Itâ€™s good for everything and thatâ€™s going really well. The card team will tell you that I occasionally message them in the middle of the night and mostly to find out that theyâ€™re already working on the idea that I just had and I literally -- my last message in the slack channel to the car team, okay, okay, Iâ€™ll get out of your hair, you have thought of everything. So Iâ€™m very excited about how well weâ€™re going. Lots of work to do though. Definitely very, very far from done.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate you guys taking the question. Very thorough discussion of the business, so thatâ€™s helpful. Max, could you talk a little bit about trends in Affirmâ€™s tender with your enterprise customers versus across the entire business and whether youâ€™re sort of closing that gap, weâ€™ve seen on big days like Amazon Prime Day where apparently BNPL oversamples. What I think youâ€™ve talked about is being your total tender share, and maybe just an update there on how much runway there is in closing that and whether or not ultimately you can grow that beyond the total company?\nMax Levchin: Certainly donâ€™t think itâ€™s appropriate for me to comment on any one particular partner, although obviously we feel weâ€™ve done really well there. But if you look at share of cart, as we call it, in our largest partners, weâ€™re far from done. I refer you back to my -- one of my bragging points. Shopify partnership has been around for three years, and I think several folks in the analyst community have written that off as well. Itâ€™s now stable and will grow some sort of a single digits slow grower because theyâ€™re fully integrated now and yet the volume there keeps accelerating because both companies are excited to build new things and try to deliver more value to both merchants and consumers. So we certainly have a lot more room to grow in all of our very large partnerships. Frankly, I think we have a lot of room to grow in small ones as well. The large ones obviously pay off better because when you unlock something to the tune of 1%, youâ€™re playing with billions instead of millions. So feel very good about there -- about that. The companies are enormous. They have lots of conflicting priorities. And so, it will absolutely take longer than our average efforts, especially because -- the reason these companies chose us is because we are technologists and we build software really, really well. That means that majority of integrations are complex. If youâ€™re a tiny little company and you take our standard API and implement it and we bring you live. Literally, it can be done at this point in a self-service environment for small companies. Thatâ€™s pretty awesome, and I bragged about that in the letter as well. For a much larger partner, this is a real effort and it takes quarters to get it right and make sure all the plumbing works and scales and handles things like Prime Days, which are enormous spikes of volume. And so once thatâ€™s there, deploying optimizations and changes and new initiatives is not a thing you can sort of flip a switch and see what happens. You have to follow the thoroughness and deliberate nature of such efforts, but when they do work, they are dramatic leads. And so we certainly have many more leads to take. Obviously, Iâ€™m extremely biased, so sort of discount that appropriately. I do think the product we offer works better than credit cards, and credit cards are the dominant way to pay across all these merchants. We feel like we have lots more share to grab it.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay, helpful. And then -- Iâ€™ve asked you this question before. The 91% of transactions from existing customers, that KPI or that stat. Does that number over time for you to achieve your goals need to come down a lot, just as far as greater acceptance and use across the base? And does Affirm Card help you get there or am I just barking up the wrong tree?\nMax Levchin: I certainly donâ€™t think youâ€™re barking up the wrong tree. Itâ€™s something that I look at a lot. The way I think about it is every consumer has a certain amount of spend that theyâ€™re doing today, some of it on credit, some of it from cash, we are competing for that. We are not trying to create new debts where there wasnâ€™t some because we are -- obviously we donâ€™t charge late fees, we donâ€™t compound interest, so we donâ€™t benefit from delinquency, we donâ€™t benefit from spending. We are very careful not to overextend our consumers. Part of the mission is to create healthier financial realities for our customers, not to push them into unsustainable spending. And so, we are trying to shift spending onto our instruments. Depending on kind of how far you cast your eye in the future of Affirm, obviously, first time transactions that number youâ€™re talking about will come down. As we get to more and more customers underwritten, by definition that number will start trending up. So I donâ€™t know if I have a -- the right number is 78.37. Thatâ€™s the perfect one, and -- not at all, I look at it as a indicator of where we are. The reality of new versus repeating users for us kind of a two sided coin if you will. New users are the highest risk loans we will write. When you have never transacted with a firm before, by definition we donâ€™t know you as well as we do someone who has transacted already. So, wherever we take a more careful risk stance and we have been in a relatively conservative one for quite some time, you can expect us to be deliberately careful with approving new consumers. On the other hand, we are very excited to take more and more share from our friends in the credit card world. And so, we are delighted when the frequency goes up which is in fact reflected in the percentage of transactions from repeat users. So, there are multiple vectors on this metric, not too obsessed with it. I care a lot more about overall GMV growth. Credit metrics obviously are absolutely paramount. Frequency of consumer is something that I look quite a lot about, although itâ€™s worth saying that at this point we see very clear stratification of consumers. People have chosen that Affirm is their primary spending device and those numbers are very different from the average that we post. And at some point, Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll start breaking that out, but not very this second. \nOperator: Our last question is from Reggie Smith of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nReggie Smith: I guess the biggest variance this quarter to my estimate was the interest income line. And I noticed or Iâ€™ve seen over the past few quarters that your mix of interest bearing transactions of volume has been growing. My question for you, how common are prepayments in your business? And I ask that because Iâ€™m trying to, I guess, get to the durability of that interest income. I know I think in quarters past, Mike has suggested that it took a while for the rates to kind of bleed in. It looks like weâ€™re seeing that now. So Iâ€™m just trying to figure out the durability there.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Prepayments in our business are common. Theyâ€™re understood price into all of our capital deals. And for the record, we think a good thing. Max mentioned this before. We think about consumer exposure as a real limiter. And if a consumer prepays that itâ€™s an opportunity for us transact with them again and thatâ€™s a good thing for us. Itâ€™s a really healthy sign. I said differently, the prepayment for risk for us is not really a risk versus the credit risk in the business. And so, we donâ€™t view prepayments as really a problem at all. I think a thing to remember about the product is just how short the duration is. And so prepayment risk in other asset classes is a real important thing especially in a declining rate environment, given the long-term nature of those loans, but the way that to realize here is so fast that itâ€™s really difficult for us to have a meaningful amount of the economics eroding or the interest income going away, so long as the originations are still there, right? So thatâ€™s the more important variable in terms of what we can generate, itâ€™s not just the back book for us.\nReggie Smith: So I guess the punch line is that that yield is pretty durable going forward as long as you continue to originate. Is that the right way to think about it? \nMichael Linford: You got it. Yes.\nMax Levchin: Lots of little loans spitting off pretty nice rates, but not -- we donâ€™t suffer from, oh my God, we just lost 29 years of interest, like nothing of this sort of applicable here.\nMax Levchin: And yes, I think itâ€™s worth pointing out that, I think what you saw in the past year was this rate shock hitting the business and there being a few quarters of depressed asset yield and youâ€™ve seen us recover from it. So the business model isnâ€™t one that is completely impervious in the short-term to these kinds of shocks. But over the medium term, weâ€™re able to really get the yield back in the asset, get the execution of the capital markets to a level to where we can continue to scale the business, like we want.\nReggie Smith: Perfect. Weâ€™ve gone an hour, so Iâ€™m not going to hold you guys any longer. I guess we can catch up on the call back. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMichael Linford: Thanks, Reggie.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions in the question queue. And I would like to turn the call back to Zane Keller for some closing remarks. \nZane Keller: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you again next week at our investor forum. See you there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes todayâ€™s event, and you may now disconnect your lines."
