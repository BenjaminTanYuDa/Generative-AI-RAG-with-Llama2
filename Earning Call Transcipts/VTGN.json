We encourage you to review the release, which can be found in the Investors section of the Vistagen website. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our business based on our current expectations and information. Forward-looking statements speak only as of today and except as required by law, we do not assume any duty to update in the future any forward-looking statement made today. Of course forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements we make today. Additional information concerning risks factors that could affect our business and financial results are included in our fiscal year 2024 third quarter Form 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2023, and in future filings that we make with the SEC from time to time, all of which are or will be available on our website and the SEC's website. Now with that taken care of I'd like to thank and welcome all of our stockholders, analysts and everyone taking an interest in Vistagen. I'm joined on the call today by Shawn Singh, our Chief Executive Officer; Cindy Anderson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Prince, our Chief Operating Officer. Shawn will provide an overview of our recent results and our progress across our key pipeline programs. A brief opportunity for questions from our sell-side analysts will follow the prepared remarks. I would like to remind everyone this call is being webcast and will be available for replay after completion. The replay link can be found in the Investor events section of the Vistagen website. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Shawn Singh. Shawn?\nShawn Singh: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Here at Vistagen, we are pioneering neuroscience, with an intention to deliver first-in-class therapies for psychiatric and neurological disorders, where there are few, if any, adequate and differentiated FDA-approved treatment options to satisfy the widespread needs of patients whose mental health and whose well-being are adversely affected by their disorders. Each of our clinical stage neuroscience product candidates is designed with the potential to establish new standards of care and make meaningful differences in how patients manage their disorders to improve their daily lives. Within the last few months, we've seen a renaissance in neuroscience, marked notably by pharma M&A in the neuropsychiatry space, valued at about $23 billion. We are encouraged that novel, late-stage, neuroscience-derived product candidates with differentiated safety profiles have stimulated renewed interest in large-market neuropsychiatry programs with the potential to change lives. We believe each of our clinical neuroactive pherines, led by fasedienol for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder, is anchored in novel neuroscience and has the potential to produce differentiated product profiles across multiple and diverse large-market therapeutic areas with high need for innovation and high need to transform the standards of care, including anxiety, depression, women's health and other disorders. Today, we'll briefly discuss our progress and plans for three of these -- three of our five pherine assets in our clinical-stage neuroscience pipeline, facadienol, itruvone, and PH80. As noted, our lead clinical-stage program involves fasedienol, and it's aimed at transforming the treatment paradigm for adults affected by social anxiety disorder, or SAD, which currently affects the lives of about 10% of the US adult population, with very high opportunity costs in their daily life. While the prevalence of SAD continues to grow, there's still no FDA-approved, patient-tailored, acute treatment option to help individuals with SAD rapidly and safely address their anxiety when their stressors are upon them in their daily life. With the positive results from our PALISADE-2 Phase 3 trial reported last year, and a strong balance sheet, we're fully focused on advancing our PALISADE Phase 3 development program in SAD, with preparations to initiate this year all key remaining studies planned for that program. Since our last conference call in November, our team has been diligently focused on the preparations necessary to initiate PALISADE-3, which will be our next Phase 3 clinical trial of fasedienol for the acute treatment of anxiety in adults with social anxiety disorder. That remains on track to begin in the first half of 2024. That will be followed by PALISADE-4 to be initiated in the second half of this year. PALISADE-3 and PALISADE-4 will be similar to our successful PALISADE-2 Phase 3 trial. Both trials will involve a public speaking challenge in a clinical setting with patient reported outcomes on the Subjective Units of Distress Scale or SUDS as the primary efficacy endpoint. We believe either PALISADE-3 or PALISADE-4 if successful, together with the positive results from PALISADE-2 may establish substantial evidence of effectiveness of fasedienol in support of a potential NDA submission for the acute treatment of anxiety in adults with SAD. Last year we accomplished something that to our knowledge had never been achieved and that is to demonstrate positive Phase 3 results in an anxiety study with a drug candidate that does not need to be taken up systemically or act directly on neurons in the brain. We look forward to getting back into the clinic soon with PALISADE-3 to continue driving on our mission to deliver a first-in-class therapy in a large neuropsychiatry market in need of differentiated fast-acting therapies without the risk of sexual side effects, weight gain, or abuse liability concerns. Beyond fasedienol in our Phase 3 program in SAD we are continuing to explore various ways to unlock the significant potential of itruvone asset as a differentiated new therapy for major depressive disorder or MDD. Preparations and planning for potential US Phase 2B trial of itruvone model therapy in MDD are ongoing. Again our mission in this large and unfortunately increasing neuropsychiatry market is to deliver a differentiated therapy to transform the standard of care without the risk of sexual side effects, weight gain or abuse liability concerns. We also see great potential in our rapid onset hormone-free PHAD nasal spray. Its potential is anchored in the previously unreported positive results from two trials in women's health indications that we announced last year. First is a treatment for vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes due to menopause and next, for the management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder or PMDD. PHAD showed statistically significant results in both studies. We are preparing to conduct non-clinical studies necessary to submit a USIND to facilitate further Phase 2 clinical development of PHAD for women's health indications including the treatment of patients with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes that are due to menopause. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Cindy Anderson to summarize some of the highlights from our financial results for the third quarter of our fiscal '24. Cindy?\nCindy Anderson: Thank you, Shawn. As Shawn mentioned, I will highlight a few financial results from our fiscal year 2024 third quarter. I also encourage everyone to review our quarterly report on Forum 10Q filed with the SEC earlier this afternoon, for additional details and disclosures. Research and development expense was $4.5 million and $6.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to a decrease in clinical and development expenses related to the timing of such expenses incurred in our Phase 3 trials of fasedienol and FAD. General and administrative expense was $3.8 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to $3.1 million for the prior period. The increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation-related expenses. Our net loss attributed to common shareholders was $6.3 million and $9.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively. At December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126.6 million. I will also note that this afternoon as customary for development stage companies in our sector, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S3 with the SEC to renew a previous S3, which was set to expire next month. Shelf registration statements on Form S3 are standard in our industry and are intended to provide us with broad flexibility to improve our balance sheet in the future as may be needed. As a reminder, please refer to our core report on Form 10-Q filed today with the SEC for additional details and disclosures. I will now turn the call back over to Shawn.\nShawn Singh: Thanks, Cindy. So as we wrap up today's call, I want to emphasize that we are very proud and very excited to be focused on reaching another key corporate milestone in the near term. That's the initiation of our PALISADE-3 Phase 3 trial of fasedienol for the acute treatment of anxiety in adults with SAD. We will progress through the next phases of our core corporate development strategies with confidence in our team's expertise to execute our PALISADE Phase 3 clinical program of fasedienol and SAD, the potential of our robust pipeline for multiple and diverse psychiatric and neurological disorders, and our steadfast commitment to pioneering neuroscience to develop and commercialize truly differentiated treatment solutions. So on behalf of our whole team here at Vistagen, I want to thank you for your continued support.\nMark McPartland: Thank you, Shawn. Operator, we would now like to turn the call over for questions from the sell-side analysts participating on the call today.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Matisse with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, this is Julian on for Paul. Thanks so much for taking our question. Just a quick one for me; are you still planning on doing a repeat dose study for fasedienol in SAD? And if so, would you be able to provide any color on that? Thanks so much.\nShawn Singh: You bet. Thanks, Julian. Yeah, we are going to do a repeat dose study. It'll be similar in design to PALISADE-3 and to PALISADE-4, and thus obviously by extension PALISADE-2. It'll be smaller and it'll assess the safety and potential benefit of a second dose of fasedienol that is administered within 10 minutes after the first dose and prior to public speaking challenge. So similar study design, similar endpoint, obviously much smaller and the result of that study, part of it is in agreement with FDA, especially as to any potential safety issue, which we don't anticipate any with repeat dosing, but it really could inform the labelling and provide some guidance as to whether or not a second dose administered within 10 minutes, which might be the case in a real-world setting, is safe and as we anticipated, could be again -- could provide any potential benefit for some patients. So we'll prepare to initiate that study in the second half of this year as we've guided.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Excellent. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Tsai: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking my question. So maybe the first one on PALISADE-3, PALISADE-4, you're employing obviously some studying improvements to those programs. So could it be fair to assume that the SUDS separation in those studies could be even greater than what you saw in PALISADE-2 because as you're mitigating for placebo effect, could you be further maximizing the drug effect?\nShawn Singh: Well, thanks, Andrew. As you mentioned, we've done quite a few things to further de-risk the Phase 3 program and a lot of lessons learned on the other side of the prior studies and obviously this is not now a study design and an endpoint that sites and investigators are seeing after a pretty long hiatus in the space of a couple decades. So the things that we've done to improve surveillance, improve and further de-risk execution of the program, certainly that's a possibility. But there are a lot of things. If you compare the world in 2022 to where we are today in '24, just at a minimum taking masks out of the equation is a big difference. Having the ability to have in person investigator meetings, have the ability to do things that ensure rigorous adherence to the protocol, very exacting requirements of that protocol consistently across sites. All those things combined have the potential, of course, to improve even on what we've seen in the past in Phase 2 and in PALISADE-2. Josh Prince, you want to add anything to that?\nJosh Prince: Sure, Shawn. Thank you. Yeah, I think we're very optimistic about our ability to execute a well- controlled study post-pandemic and it's everything that you talked about, but it's also the things that we're able to do in terms of how we work with our CRO. We're putting feet on the ground in terms of our own monitors going to sites in addition to CRO monitors. We have some additional exclusion criteria to make sure that subjects that are coming into the study have the best chance to have positive results or opportunity to have positive results with fasedienol and even things such as eligibility review, making sure that subjects are appropriate subjects before they're going into the Visit 2 and Visit 3 public speaking challenges. So you put all those things together and it does give us a fair amount of optimism moving into PAL-3 and PAL-4 compared to what we had when we were executing PALISADE-1 and PALISADE-2.\nAndrew Tsai: Thanks. And maybe a follow-up on the repeat dose study that you're initiating in second half. As we think about the three arms, what are you and the FDA looking for or said in another way, what is positive data to you?\nShawn Singh: Josh, go ahead and address that.\nJosh Prince: Yeah, we expect it to be a smaller study. So, it's not at this point, we don't expect to see, power for statistical significance like you would in the PALISADE-3 or PALISADE-4, but it would give us is, is there any is there any indication that for some patients an additional dose within 10 minutes could provide some benefit and that essentially can inform the label. So, at the end of the day for us positive study is we either see that there is some indication that it could be a benefit or we don't, but either way, there's benefit from the first dose.\nShawn Singh: Yeah, again, it's really the discussions have been circled around informing labelling downstream and also real-world understanding and some of that taken from open label activity where people might think more is better within a short period of time. So first and foremost, we have to check the box on safety, which again we don't think there's much of if any risk there associated with a second dose within that 10-minute window. For those who don't know, there's three arms before a public speaking challenge. Placebo, placebo drug, placebo drug, drug, each of the second doses within 10 minutes of the first and that's up front of public speaking challenges. So again, taking into account possibilities in the real world that people will use the drug a couple of times rather than staggered as the 15-minute study paradigm required or showed. So we'll see how it goes. Again, it's a dialogue. It's nice to be knowing we're talking about potential labelling benefits. So that's how we took it. These remember -- these receptors are activated in milliseconds. So it doesn't take much time to get them moving in the first instance.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tim Lugo with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Lugo: Thanks for the question and congratulations on the progress. For fasedienol, given a non-systemic, non-abusable profile and with a positive PAL-2 trial, could you look to gain breakthrough status with the agency? Is it something you're exploring? If you were to get breakthrough status, is it something that could impact your development path at all? And in your discussions with the agency, do you have enough maybe I guess preclinical data around abusability or enough animal data around abusability to have that included in the label?\nShawn Singh: Thanks Tim. Appreciate those questions. So, first as to BTD or breakthrough, look, that's always an aspiration of any company that's got something in a space that we've got. It's always an advocacy matter with the agency. I think, like I said, we just got done doing something we don't think anybody else has ever done that we've seen and we've certainly got a product profile potential that is different than anything that we see out there. We know the agency is worried about the potential high abuse of benzodiazepines given their drug safety communication on that during COVID. We also know that unfortunately social anxiety disorder and other anxiety disorders lead to depression and then lead, unfortunately, with increasing prevalence that we are seeing to suicidal ideation. So we already know we have fast-track. It doesn't mean that you necessarily fall into breakthrough, but certainly something on our mind. And you're right too that it is important whether or not we see this drug as potentially being scheduled. As we addressed a while back, especially with a drug that is administered intranasally, one might think, well, is it is there some abuse potential there? As we know from the preclinical work we've done and that we submitted to the FDA and also clinical work, a large body of work, including the open label study about 500 subjects with over 30,000 doses, we just were not seeing TEAEs or any certainly no SAEs that are usually associated with abuse liability, even in the longer-term open label. Mechanistically, it makes sense because the drug isn't taken up systemically and most importantly, based on the GABA study that we did preclinically and the C14 studies that we did, there's not tissue distribution and direct activity on the abuse liability receptors in the brain, opiate, nicotine, dopamine and the like and not potentiating GABA, like say a benzo would also worked in our favor. So I think we're very confident as we continue to see clinical data support the preclinical data and the whole package that says this is a differentiated safety profile because of the MOA. We're confident in a go-forward where patients could have the ability to access the drug online on a recurring basis with the drug potentially not being scheduled, no REMS. So we'll see how that continues to go, but what we saw in PALISADE-2, again, no TEA, more prevalent than 2%. In the large open label study, nothing more prevalent than 5% other than headache at 8.7%. So that's remarkably different than what we often hear when we're listening to commercials and side effects that are associated with particular therapeutic options.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mark McPartland. Please go ahead sir.\nMark McPartland: Thank you, Travis. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Vistagen's fiscal year 2024 second quarter corporate update conference call and webcast. This afternoon we filed our quarterly report and issued a press release providing an overview of our progress last quarter. We encourage you to review the release, which can be found on the Investors section of the Vistagen website. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our business based on our current expectations and information. Forward-looking statements speak only as of today and except as required by law, we do not assume any duty to update in the future any forward-looking statement made today. Of course forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements we make today. Additional information concerning risks factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in our fiscal year 2024 second quarter Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2023, and in future filings that we will make with the SEC from time to time, all of which are or will be available on our website and the SEC's website. With that taken care of I'd like to thank and welcome all of our stockholders, analysts and everyone taking an interest in Vistagen. I'm joined on the call today by Shawn Singh, our Chief Executive Officer; Cindy Anderson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Prince, our Chief Operating Officer. Shawn will provide an overview on the recent results and our progress across our key pipeline programs. A brief opportunity for questions from our sell-side analysts will follow the prepared remarks. This call is being webcast and will be available for replay after completion. The replay link can be found in the Investor Events section of our website. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Shawn Singh.\nShawn Singh: Thank you, Mark and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call. We achieved several milestones since our last call to establish a well-defined and fully funded Phase 3 development program of our lead pherine asset fasedienol with the potential to enable us to advance to appeal to a potential NDA submission for the acute treatment with social anxiety disorder. In the midst of the ongoing mental illness crisis, we are poised to transform the treatment paradigm for this widespread anxiety disorder that affects the lives of about 10% of our population. Social anxiety disorder or SAD is a disruptive, serious and potentially life-threatening anxiety disorder with high opportunity cost in daily life and no FDA approved patient tailored, as needed acute treatment option to help individuals rapidly and safely, address their anxiety when the stresses are upon them during what for many is their decades long journey with SAD. The hope of a revolutionary approach to treatment extends beyond fasedienol and SAD to our full pherine-based-portfolio and we remain fully focused on their development to create faster-acting, safer alternatives to address significant unmet needs in large CNS-related markets, where current treatment options fall short for patients. Since our last conference call in August, we've continued to build on the momentum created by our successful PALISADE-2, Phase 3 study of fasedienol for the treatment of anxiety in adults with social anxiety disorder. During the past few months, we've strengthened our balance sheet considerably, securing $137.7 million in gross proceeds from equity financings and exclusive negotiation agreement with Fuji Pharma regarding a potential license to develop and commercialize our PH80 in Japan. We expect this cash infusion will extend our corporate runway through several important clinical and corporate milestones as we advance our pipeline including our primary focus on a potential US new drug application or NDA for fasedienol in SAD. Given that fasedienol's rapid onset mechanism of action is differentiated from all FDA approved anxiety drugs. Our primary target initial indication for fasedienol remains the acute treatment of anxiety in adults with SAD. And as noted, there's no FDA approved drug therapy for the acute treatment of SAD. For that acute indication, we've previously aligned with the FDA that a simulated public speaking challenge in a clinical setting is an appropriate study design and that the subjective units of distress scale or SUDS is an appropriate primary efficacy endpoint to assess the efficacy of fasedienol because it provides a measure of anxiety on a minute by minute basis immediately related to specific stressor and we believe utilizing a simulated anxiety provoking public speaking challenge study design provides the most appropriate and efficient path for fasedienol to potentially become the first FDA approved acute treatment of anxiety for adults with SAD. So to complement the positive top line results from PALISADE-2, we are currently preparing to launch two similar Phase 3 clinical trials in 2024: PALISADE-3 in the first half of 2024 and PALISADE-4 in the second half of 2024. Like the successful PALISADE-2 study both PALISADE -3 and PALISADE-4 will be multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the acute administration of fasedienol to relieve anxiety symptoms in adult patients with SAD after a single dose of fasedienol during a simulated anxiety provoking public speaking challenge conducted in the clinical setting and as measured using the patient reported SUDS as the primary efficacy endpoint. PALISADE-3 and 4 will also have an open label extension for up to 12 months to provide additional long-term safety data. If successful, we believe either PALISADE-3 or PALISADE-4, together with PALISADE-2, may establish substantial evidence of the effectiveness of fasedienol in support of a potential fasedienol NDA submission for the acute treatment of anxiety in adults with SAD in the first half of 2026. We also plan to initiate a small fasedienol Phase 2b repeat dose study in the second half of 2024. The fasedienol repeat dose study will be a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial a small one about 60 subjects to evaluate the efficacy safety and tolerability of a repeat dose of fasedienol that's administered 10 minutes after an initial dose to further relieve symptoms of acute anxiety in adults with SAD during the anxiety provoking public speaking challenge. That repeat dose study will consist of three different dosing arms with an open label extension for up to 12 months. 12 months open label extensions planned for the PALISADE-3, 4 and repeat dose studies are all intended to expand our fasedienol safety database. For ICH guidelines targeting 300 patients treated with fasedienol for at least six months and 100 for 12 months. To-date, over 750 subjects, have been exposed to fasedienol including over 30,000 doses administered in our PALISADE open label safety study. And we continue to be very encouraged with fasedienol safety profile in all clinical studies to-date. Positive PALISADE-2 data also bolster our growing confidence in the evidence supporting the potential of our entire pherine pipeline. We've had some recent advancements in a couple of other programs. Let's take a brief look at those. In June, we completed a successful randomized double-blind placebo controlled Phase 1 study, intended to investigate the safety and tolerability of itruvone in healthy adult subjects. That trial was conducted to stage potential Phase 2b clinical development of itruvone in the US and it confirmed the favorable safety profile by itruvone, establishing three previous clinical trials conducted in Mexico, including a positive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2a study of itruvone in major depressive disorder or MDD. As we advance and remain focused primarily on our PALISADE Phase 3 program for fasedienol in SAD, we also plan to explore various ways to unlock the significant potential value by itruvone as a differentiated non-systemic monotherapy for MDD through potential strategic partnering arrangements in the US as well as in major markets outside the US. We're also optimistic about our hormone-free non-systemic PH80 nasal spray, which has now been studied in multiple significant women's health indications. Within the last two quarters, we've announced positive results from two PH80 studies in women's health indications. The first of which was the exploratory Phase 2a study of PH80 in women diagnosed with vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes that are due to menopause. And the Phase 2a study PH80 induced a significant reduction in the daily number of hot flashes compared to placebo at the end of the first week of treatment and the improvement was maintained through each treatment week until the end of the treatment period. PH80 treatment also significantly reduced the severity of the disruption and function sweating related to hot flashes during the treatment period compared to placebo. It was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and the adverse event profiles were comparable between PH80 and placebo. One of the favorable aspects of running additional trials in this particular indication is that there will be objective measures for these studies that say that it's easier to measure how many hot flashes are experienced in the frequency of those symptoms versus more subjective end points that we often see in other studies in different indications. The other positive PH80 data we announced recently were from an exploratory Phase 2a study of PH80 for the acute management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder or PMDD. In this study, PH80 demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement versus placebo in symptoms of PMDD using the subject rated Penn daily symptom report as early as day four continuing to day six. There are limited effective treatment options that help with both physical and mood symptoms of PMDD and we believe these results are quite promising. Given the depth of our entire CNS pipeline and the now robust body of successful safety and efficacy studies to date, we are also pursuing multiple potential nondilutive strategic development and commercialization partnerships, both global and regional to unlock the full value of our product candidate portfolio efficiently. We believe global and regional partnerships would amplify our internal expertise and development activities, potentially accelerate key development time lines and enhance our overall efforts to deliver differentiated new treatment options where the current standard of care fall short. As an example of this, we recently announced the receipt of $1.5 million from our exclusive negotiation agreement with Fuji Pharma, regarding a potential license to develop and commercialize PH80 in hot flashes due to menopause and other indications in Japan. This is simply a right to discuss the potential for that license with us in a time-limited period. It's not a license. It's simply a nonrefundable payment to us to talk to us. I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Cindy Anderson to summarize some of the highlights from our financial results for our fiscal year 2024 second quarter. Cindy has been a great recent addition to our team, following the retirement of our former CFO, Jerry Dotson after his over 10 years of distinguished service to the company. Cindy?\nCindy Anderson: Thank you, Shawn. It's great to be part of team. As Shawn mentioned, I'd like to highlight a few financial results for fiscal year 2024 second quarter. I also encourage everyone to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC earlier this afternoon for additional details and disclosures. Research and development expenses decreased by approximately $9 million from $12 million to $3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and 2023 respectively. The decrease in R&D expense, primarily due to the completing the initial studies of our PALISADE Phase 3 programs in SAD, as well as reduced non clinical development regulatory and outsource manufacturing activities for fasedienol and itruvone. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $0.5 million from $3.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 to $3.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased compensation, consulting fees and professional services. Our net loss attributed to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $6.6 million versus a net loss of approximately $17.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023, Vistagen had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $37.6 million. From September 30, we received approximately $93.5 million in net proceeds from an underwritten equity financing and $1.5 million from Fuji Pharma under exclusive negotiation agreements. If our PALISADE Phase three program is successful, w believe that our current cash position will be sufficient to fund our operations through potential submission of a US new drug application for fasedienol for the acute treatment of anxiety in adults with SAD. As a reminder, please refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today with the SEC for additional details and disclosures. I will now turn the call back over to Shawn.\nShawn Singh: Thank you, Cindy. So to wrap up, our dedication to enhancing global mental health and the overall well-being of individuals who are affected by a wide range of CNS disorders is unwavering. And as we are progressing through the next phases of our corporate development strategy, we're doing that with confidence in the potential of our PALISADE Phase 3 program for fasedienol in social anxiety disorder, as well as the clinical stage assets that are up and down our entire pipeline. We've got a capable team, got a robust pipeline and we've got a steadfast commitment to pioneer and differentiated solutions, totally different approaches to the current standard of care for multiple sizable CNS markets that have substantial unmet needs. So on behalf of our entire Vistagen team, once again, we're grateful for the privilege and for the opportunity to create meaningful impacts for patients not only in the US, but all around the world, who are impacted in their daily lives by these disruptive and often disabling serious CNS conditions.\nMark McPartland: Thank you, Shawn. Operator, we'd like to open up the call for questions from the sell-side analysts participating on the call today.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Tsai, Jefferies.\nAndrew Tsai: Hey good afternoon. I appreciate taking the questions and congrats on the progress. Great to see you making strides here. So, obviously the next step for -- PH94B is to start the PALISADE-3 in first half of 2024. So, what needs to be done for you to start earlier in Q1, rather than Q2? What exactly are the bottlenecks there next? Thanks.\nShawn Singh: Thanks, Andrew. Appreciate the question. I agree, thanks to INN, it is easy to say PH94B than fasedienol. We hope the world will get used to that soon enough. The answer is we are targeting Q1 and so we are -- everything we're doing right now is in preparation to launch PALISADE-3 in the first quarter of 2024. So all the pregame work a lot of that's already been underway for several months now. And of course we bring a lot of knowledge from the prior studies to bear into that effort. So that's our target and we'd expect to be able to have PALISADE-4 follow hopefully early in the second quarter -- early in the second half of 2024.\nAndrew Tsai: Okay. Very good. And can you summarize for us just one more time, all the things you're going to do differently and PALISADEs 3 and 4 to ensure study execution, what removal/deletions or additions are you making to these studies relative to the prior two studies?\nShawn Singh:  Yeah, great. Thank you for that question. It's important question. As you obviously know the macro world is fundamentally different as we move into the first part of 2024 as it is right now relative to 2022 or 2021, certainly 2021. And what's nice to see is the return to normal of a lot of the typical conventions that are associated with efficient execution, preparation and execution of clinical studies. As it relates to our particular protocol and the studies that we'll be initiating going forward with this public speaking challenge in the study design that's associated with SUDS, there are certain things that may or may not have been in effect, but we know that it's possible for COVID to disrupt the olfactory system a bit. So there will be no subjects enrolled that have had a nasal swab within a month for RSV, for COVID, for flu. They'll have to pass the smell test an olfactory -- clinical factory test in order to be eligible, to be no high-frequency vapors or smokers or drinkers of Red Bull and things of that nature. There's a high level of scrutiny that's associated with the front end with assessing patient eligibility, Josh Prince is on. Josh is our COO and oversees our team. Josh, you want to highlight a few other things?\nJosh Prince: Yeah. I think you captured a couple there Shawn. And it's important to think of essentially we're doing everything we can to ensure that we have the patience for this one-dose public speaking challenge make sure you have patients in there that can get the benefit from product. It's those things that Shawn mentioned that's also kind of do the oversight in terms of sites, in terms of changing the way that we monitor and work with our CRO over the sites to make sure that we're on top of things that we have data reviews, eligibility reviews those types of things. So those are the key is to make sure that we have a successful study. It's really all about the execution of that public speaking challenge with the right patients in there and that's where we're focused forward.\nShawn Singh : Some of the other things Andrew that are possible. Obviously, the surveillance is -- it's fundamentally changed since even PALISADE-2. So part of our operating model is to make sure we have our own people on sites in addition to the resources that are brought to bear by CROs in the sites themselves. Of course, no masks will be involved in PALISADE-3 or PALISADE-4 which is a big difference from the prior studies. So just trying to get back to a situation where the macro environment allows us to apply, a lot of the trade craft that's been historically successful when we're trying to not only plan for, let's say with an in-person investigators' meeting the likes of which weren't possible with some of the earlier studies. That starts things off and then the ability to interact more frequently with sites in person all that's important when you're trying to generate rigorous adherence to the study protocol. I think also what we'll see is better predictability about site staff in general. The depth of the set the staff's, the more consistent execution -- ability to execute between studies, study visits I should say or predictably planned them. So a lot of things that are essential to be able to execute a protocol such as we've got in place for the successful PAL-2 study. And as we bring that into PAL-3 and 4 even more confidence in the overall environment than was the case in 2022.\nAndrew Tsai : Thank you. And maybe last one for me. I want to be respectful of the other colleagues here. Can you give us a flavor of what additional data will be presented at your medical conferences tomorrow for those that are not diagnosed? And I think there's another asset that's where there's data being presented. So what would be the key takeaways that we should take home for these presentations? Thank you.\nShawn Singh: Thanks. Well, a key effort right now is to obviously raise awareness of what the clinical audience hasn't seen in many, many years in this indication. So to be able -- you'll see mostly from those presentations on the top line results from PALISADE-2 as well some data from our open-label study which is remarkable. Given the number of doses and the number of subjects exposed to the drug in an anxiety disorder, you still see it and then some data from our PH80 study. So key to what we are doing now, obviously, is to raise awareness of what's been achieved as well as to raise awareness of what's ahead not only in the markets, but also within the clinical communities that we know ultimately will be key pieces of the puzzle downstream.\nAndrew Tsai: Great. Thank you very much.\nShawn Singh: All right. Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair.\nTim Lugo: Thanks for taking the question. Can you update us on the lack of abuse potential for fasedienol? I think, I got that right. I know you have some preclinical data around that but I'm wondering if there's anything incremental coming out of PAL-2, and just maybe your interactions with the agency as well.\nShawn Singh: Yeah. Thanks Tim. Good to hear from you. Obviously the data that we teed up to the agency back in 2022 was focused on whether or not there were signals and had been any signals at that time of abuse liability potential given that this is a nasal spray and a lot of folks were wondering well what happens when you put something in the nose is it become addictive? And the uniqueness of this mechanism of action that we have with fasedienol and the rest of the variants is important to note, because what we're dealing with and we've done multiple studies not only on the clinical side, but some important preclinical ones associated with the reality that there's no potentiation of GABA for example as you see with benzodiazepines. Radio labeling the drug showed no systemic exposure. So the drugs these variants don't have to get into the brain and act directly on CNS neurons in the brain, including the abuse liability receptors that are typically out there. So we put a whole body of work to the agency at the time and asked the question what came back from as we reported was they didn't see any reason for us to have to do a human abuse liability study at that time. Since then what's been delivered is all of the data from the open-label study, which had 481 subjects and the adverse event profile in that study was remarkable especially again for drug and neuropsychiatry where the most common adverse effect was our adverse event was headache and that was reported and really only 17% overall, but 8.7% were drug-related and beyond COVID-19, which was 0% drug-related there was no other treatment emergent adverse effect in more than 5% of the participants. And in the PALISADE-2 study similar in PALISADE-1 similar safety profile although even less prevalent in terms of the treatment emergent adverse effects. So these are events. These data overall non-clinical and clinical really continue to reinforce our belief in why we don't see these safety concerns you typically see associated with benzones or antidepressants. These are not systemically absorbed drugs. You cannot detect them in the plasma. And so you're basically using the nose as a portal to achieve the effects from different regions of the brain that are associated with these different indications, not having to go in the mouth and might be metabolized by the liver, bump into other drugs through the bloodstream, other blood-brain barrier into the brain, all those are major factors that really distinguish this class from everything that's historically been approved or is even in development for these neuropsychiatric indications. So it's not a concern we've had in the past, it's not a concern the FDA had when we showed them the data and it's certainly not a concern that we have now after tens of thousands of more doses and hundreds of more subjects since we first got that read from the FDA.\nTim Lugo: That's great to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark McPartland: Thank you, operator.

We want to remind you that this call is being webcast and will be available for replay after the call is completed. The replay link can be found in the Investors Events section on our website. I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Shawn Singh, to update you on a recent inspiring news regarding the PALISADE-2 Phase 3 study results.\nShawn Singh: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. As I've said before, many times, our team has remained steadfast in our core mission, which is to radically improve the mental health and well-being of millions of individuals around the world who are suffering from a wide variety of anxiety, depression and other CNS disorders that severely disrupt their daily lives. And as we've recently announced, we've solidified a major cornerstone in that mission focused on improving the lives of the over 25 million individuals in America who are affected by social anxiety disorder or SAD. There's indeed an active and growing need for a new faster-acting option for treatment of SAD without abuse potential or the side effects and safety concerns that often are associated with the currently approved medicines. We remain focused on addressing this significant unmet health - mental health need for individuals across a broad range of demographics and in a diverse range of communities across the globe. We're committed to innovation of multiple differentiated treatments in alignment with our mission to shift the treatment paradigm for anxiety, depression and multiple other CNS disorders. So a lot's changed since our last conference call, and let's get right to the biggest news in our company's history. It's been a long time since a positive Phase 3 study has brought in new optimism for treatment of social anxiety disorder, and we are thrilled to be in a leadership position with the compelling top line results from our Phase 3 PALISADE-2 trial that were announced on Monday. These Phase 3 results highlight the potential for fasedienol with its innovative proposed mechanism of action to transform what's possible for millions of individuals living with SAD in the U.S. and millions more who are affected worldwide. In the PALISADE-2 study, fasedienol demonstrated a rapid and clinically meaningful reduction in the subjective units of distressed score or SUDS, SUDS score, indicating that a single administration of fasedienol has the potential to reduce rapidly anxiety symptoms during an anxiety-provoking situation similar to perhaps how a rescue inhaler used on-demand helps a person with asthma. To recap, this was a U.S. multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial consisting of four visits by subjects to a clinic that were spaced out a week apart, a screening visit, a baseline setting public speaking challenge after administration of a placebo nasal spray, a second public speaking challenge where patients were randomized to either fasedienol or placebo, then a follow-up safety visit. SUDS scores were captured at one minute intervals throughout each public speaking challenge, and physician and patient assessment of improvement were captured after the second speaking challenge was completed at visit 3. In order to progress the randomization of the second public speaking challenge or visit 3, subjects had to exhibit high levels of anxiety during the first public speaking challenge, the baseline challenge. Patients in the study were confirmed SAD patients with a score of 70 or above on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, which is commonly referred to as the LSAS, without other primary psychiatric disorders and not currently receiving active CNS medications. In total, 141 subjects were randomized in the trial, 70 on fasedienol and 71 on placebo. The total enrollment reflects the pause in enrollment after we receive top line results from PALISADE-1 to allow for independent biostatisticians to conduct an interim analysis of the 141 patients who were randomized and had completed the trial up to the date of the pause. Although the results of the independent interim analysis indicated the continuation of PALISADE-2 would not be futile, for business reasons, we elected to extend our pause of PALISADE-2, pending our assessment of the then impending top line results of our PALISADE open-label safety study, the results of two SAD public speaking challenge studies conducted by peer companies, further discussions with the FDA regarding the continuing acceptability of the LSAS as the primary efficacy end point in Phase 3 studies for the treatment of SAD as well as a comprehensive assessment or important assessment of the expense, time, statistical and regulatory implications and logistical challenges associated with resuming PALISADE-2. Following positive results from our PALISADE open label study, the results of the two SAD public speaking challenge studies conducted by peer companies, each of which did not meet their primary efficacy end point as measured by the SUDS and our positive discussions with the FDA in early 2023 about the continuing validity and reliability of the LSAS as a primary efficacy end point, for strategic reasons, we chose to close PALISADE-2 with 141 completed subjects rather than resume the study and randomize an additional 67 subjects for a total of 208 subjects as originally planned. It's very important to note that through this process, PALISADE-2 was not altered in any way. It was simply stopped early with an intention to treat population of 141 subjects instead of the originally planned 208. The statistical analysis plan was followed as originally planned. It was similar to PALISADE-1 and did not require a type 1 error correction because the study was not altered and the blind was never compromised as a result of the interim analysis. The primary end point in PALISADE-2 was a difference in mean SUDS score during the public speaking challenge at visit two baseline and visit three treatment for patients who receive fasedienol compared to placebo. Fasedienol-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater change in least-squares mean SUDS score with a reduction of 13.8 points compared to a reduction of 8 points for a difference between groups of 5.8 with a p-value of 0.015. We believe these results to be clinically significant, especially considering they're based on a single dose of fasedienol in a highly provocative public speaking challenge and is supported by high responder rates captured in the secondary and exploratory end points. The study had a secondary end point, the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale or CGI-I. Fasedienol demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the proportion of clinician-assessed responders versus placebo as measured by the CGI-I. Responders were identified as those who were rated as very much less anxious or much less anxious after visit three with 37.7% of fasedienol-treated patients rated as responders as compared to 21.4% of those treated with placebo, with a p-value of 0.033. Plus, these results clearly demonstrate that physicians were able to recognize the improvement in patients on fasedienol even with the full week between two public speaking challenges. The PALISADE-2 study also had an exploratory end point. Patient's Global Impression of Change scale or PGI-I. Very excited about the patient's ability to have recognized their improvement on fasedienol because responders were identified on that scale as those who self-rated very much less anxious or much less anxious after visit 3, an impressive 40.6% of fasedienol-treated patients rated themselves as responders as compared to only 18.6% of those treated with placebo with a p-value of 0.003. This responder rate of more than double the rate of placebo clearly illustrates to us that patients could appreciate the improvement in their ability to deliver their speech and is highly relevant clinically when you think about the potential for patients to engage with less fear and reduced avoidance of their anxiety provoking events and situations, especially as they continued to use fasedienol over time, as we saw from LSAS data in our placebo-controlled Phase 2 crossover study and our open label - PALISADE open label study. In addition, other than - the other important exploratory end point, the percentage of fasedienol patients who improved by 20 or more SUDS points at visit three was almost double the rate of placebo with 35.7% of fasedienol patients dropping by 20 or more points compared to 18.6% on placebo. A 20-point drop is very clinically relevant and likely makes a difference in improving patient's ability to engage in an anxiety-provoking event. From a safety standpoint, similar to all of the prior studies of fasedienol completed to date, including our large PALISADE open label study that included 481 subjects and over 30,000 doses of fasedienol that were administered in that study, fasedienol in PALISADE-2 was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events, and there was no treatment-emergent adverse event occurring at a rate above 1.5%. So now let's compare the primary end point in PALISADE-2 to the primary efficacy end point result in PALISADE-1. As many of you know, it's not uncommon in mental health studies to have both positive and negative studies in separate studies of similar design, particularly true of the subject scales that - given the subject scales that have to be used in such studies and the potential for high and unexpected variability and placebo effects as we saw in PALISADE-1. This becomes even more likely when you add the task of consistently administering a complex public speaking challenge across numerous sites during an unprecedented pandemic, public health crisis and mental health epidemic. The key difference in the outcome of PALISADE-1 compared to PALISADE-2 was a much higher placebo effect in PALISADE-1. The drug effect in both studies was similar. This was generally true across the primary, the secondary and the exploratory end points. The end results of the primary end point in PALISADE-1 was a least-squares mean change in SUDS from visit two to visit three of 15.6 points for fasedienol and 17.3 points for placebo with a p-value of 0.506. We firmly believe that the systemic variability introduced by the pandemic contributed to these very unexpected and very different results between these two studies. A large portion of PALISADE-1 was fielded in 2021 through the height of the second wave of the pandemic. While the vast majority of PALISADE-2 was fielded in 2022 as the acute phase of the pandemic has subsided. This dynamic likely impacted PALISADE-2 disproportionately in terms of patient mindset, study protocol execution and study oversight. Subjects randomized in 2021 likely were given - were different given the overall level of anxiety and uncertainty and general unrest, restrictions, mask wearing and the like during the acute phase of the pandemic. The high placebo rate in PALISADE-1 also may have attributed to logistical issues caused by COVID-19 in '21 such as high site and CRO employee turnover, absenteeism, changes in raters, time lapses between visit two and visit three due to unpredictable and intermittent clinical site closures and patients postponing travel, delayed monitoring visits and the like. As these dynamics became apparent as the acute phase of the pandemic subsided in early 2022, we also initiated retraining and renewed monitoring of sites as is customary with staggered start replicate studies. And that, too, may have had a much larger impact on PALISADE-2 as it was completed before the majority of patients went through that study. We view the results of PALISADE-1 as an outlier, driven by the aforementioned reasons, and we are highly confident in the potential of fasedienol in future studies given multiple positive Phase 2 studies, efficacy seen on the exploratory end point and the PALISADE open label study, and now the strong results in our placebo-controlled Phase 3 PALISADE-2 trial. This is especially meaningful after the recent multiple failures in SAD studies by peers that may have been subject to similar systemic variability from the pandemic. With the statistically significant and clinically meaningful results of PALISADE-2, we're now positioned to move our Phase 3 development plan forward with the additional studies needed for a potential NDA submission, including a PALISADE-3 trial and a FEARLESS trial, allowing us to not only confirm the acute benefit of fasedienol but to confirm what we've also long believed, that the acute use of fasedienol for SAD events continued over time will lead to a reduction in disease severity. Coupled with the safety and tolerability profile we have already demonstrated, we believe fasedienol will be the ideal approach to SAD treatment in the future. Preparations are now underway to initiate these next studies. Protocol for PALISADE-3 will be substantially similar to PALISADE-2 with SUDS again as the primary efficacy end point in clinic-based public speaking challenges. And the study design of FEARLESS will be substantially similar to the multi-week real-world registration trials for the only three drugs approved for the treatment of SAD decades ago using the LSAS as the primary end point. As a new class of medicines, our 5-candidate pherine nasal spray pipeline holds the potential to transform the treatment landscape across numerous therapeutic areas. At the head of the class, stands fasedienol's potential, as demonstrated in the Phase 3 PALISADE-2 trial. That set the stage for the first fundamentally new class of medicine for individuals living with SAD in more than 20 years. Positive PALISADE-2 data bolster our growing collection of evidence, supporting future clinical studies of fasedienol across several disorders and gives us further confidence in the promise of our pherine pipeline's untapped potential overall. We've had some recent advancements in our other pherine programs. Let's take a brief look at those. Results from our successful U.S. Phase 1 trial of itruvone, previously referred to as PH10, build on successful Phase 1 studies in a positive randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study of itruvone in major depressive disorder, or MDD, that was previously conducted in Mexico, and stage itruvone now for Phase 2b development in the United States as a stand-alone rapid-onset pherine product candidate for the treatment of MDD. U.S. Phase 1 trial was randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, and investigated the safety and the tolerability of a single dose and multiple doses of itruvone nasal spray in healthy adult subjects. There were no reported serious adverse events or discontinuations that were due to adverse events in the study. Overall, itruvone nasal spray was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile consistent with all prior clinical studies of itruvone. For Itruvone, we also reported important preclinical data of radiolabeled intranasal itruvone in laboratory rats, which further validate its potential to treat MDD without systemic absorption. These new data additionally support the proposed mechanism of action of itruvone nasal spray as binding to receptors of peripheral chemosensory neurons in the nasal cavity but not to neuronal receptors in the brain, thereby limiting transporter molecules to the circulatory system and minimizing potential systemic exposure. As was the case when we completed a similar study with fasedienol, these preclinical data further the substantial body of evidence supporting itruvone's favorable safety profile. We're continuing our preparations for advancing into Phase 2b development of itruvone for MDD in 2024. We're also very excited about our PH80 pherine nasal spray, which has been highly studied in multiple indications. We recently reported a positive exploratory Phase 2a trial of PH80 nasal spray, which provides new optimism for the acute treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes in women due to menopause. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory Phase 2a clinical study of PH80 that was designed to explore the efficacy, safety and tolerability of PH80 for the acute treatment of menopausal hot flashes in women, PH80 induced a significant reduction in the daily number of hot flashes compared to placebo at the end of the first week of treatment, and the improvement was maintained through each treatment week until the end of the treatment period. Baseline subjects reported a mean daily number of hot flashes of 7.7 in the PH80 group of 18 subjects and 8.0 in the placebo group of 18 subjects as well. After one week of treatment, the number of hot flashes dropped to 2.8 in the PH80 group and 6.4 in the placebo group for a p-value of less than 0.001. And after four weeks of treatment, the number of hot flashes dropped to 1.5 in the PH80 group and 5.1 in the placebo group for a p-value of less than 0.001. PH80 treatment also significantly reduced the severity and the disruption in function and sweating related to hot flashes during the treatment period as compared to placebo. PH80, as our other pherines, was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and the adverse event profile comparable between PH80 and placebo. All 36 subjects completed four weeks of treatment, and no subject discontinued participation in the study as a result of adverse events. One of the favorable aspects of running additional trials in this particular indication that there will be objective measures for these studies. That is to say it's easier to measure how many hot flashes are experienced and their frequency of those symptoms versus more subjective end points that we have seen in some of the other studies in different indications. Given the depth of our entire CNS pipeline and a robust body of successful safety and efficacy studies to date, we are also pursuing multiple potential strategic development and commercialization partnerships both global and regional to efficiently unlock the full value of our product candidate portfolio. We believe global and regional partnerships, especially for commercialization to amplify our internal expertise and development activities and potentially accelerate key development time lines and enhance overall our efforts to deliver differentiated treatment options. We'll now offer some brief comments about our financials. We've been able to reduce our cash burn rate as you will see in our to-be-filed 10-Q shortly. And we've been implementing corporate initiatives to streamline operations in order to conserve our resources. We do not anticipate any significant near-term cash burn increases. As for our cash position, we've recently taken advantage of the unusually high trading volume in our stock to strengthen the cash position on our balance sheet by over an expected $30 million in gross proceeds. To put this in high trading - to put this trading volume into perspective, more than $1 billion worth of our stock has traded since the announcement of the PALISADE-2 results on Monday, 4 trading days ago. As is industry standard, we established an at-the-market agreement with Jefferies over two years ago back in May of 2021. Until just recently, we'd only use this very sparingly back in calendar Q3 of '21. Will be continue - we will continue to be very judicious in how we use this vehicle going forward, and we have plenty of capacity remaining under our ATM to further strengthen our balance sheet should we wish to do so as well as other strategic financing options and potential non-dilutive grants and partnering arrangements. So in closing, we remain steadfast in our core mission to improve mental health and well-being worldwide. As we continue advancing the next stages of our corporate development plan, we move forward with a solid team, a strong pipeline and an unwavering drive to innovate better solutions for CNS disorders in large primary care markets with significant unmet needs. So on behalf of the Vistagen team, I'd like to thank you again for the privilege, for the opportunity to make a difference.\nMark Flather: Thank you, Sean. Jennifer, we'd now like to open up the call for questions from the sell-side analysts participating on the call today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Andrew Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Tsai: Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. And I wanted to offer a big congratulations on the recent data. So now that you have PALISADE-2 on hand, how confident are you this study could be one of two traditionally supportive placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 studies for a filing? And then second to that is do you think you'll meet with the FDA? And if so, when could we get a resolution on the next steps in the NDA package? Thanks.\nShawn Singh: Well, thanks, Andrew. I appreciate the question, and thanks for the congratulations. It's certainly enabling. Whether the FDA accepts the trial is pivotal. That's always to be determined downstream by the FDA, but there's no doubt in our mind, we didn't change anything. It's - the only difference, as I noted, was the number of subjects, so there's no type 1 error. There's no protocol amendment. There was no deviation at all from the original plan other than the number of subjects. So having a highly stat sig result with the profound safety profile that we've seen now in hundreds and hundreds of patients that have been exposed to fasedienol, you already - remember, we had FDA feedback regarding abuse liability and a favorable amount of feedback from the FDA. And that was even before our open label study delivered the results we reported. So I mean I like where we stand. Having something in this disorder with a validated end point with highly stat sig data and clean safety data, I really like our chances. So it's certainly going to be a key pillar in our NDA submission downstream should we get to that point with additional studies, at least one additional study.\nAndrew Tsai: And then now that you're going to do a PALISADE-3, as we think about the potential outcomes, do you think PALISADE-3 would look similar to what you saw in PALISADE-2 or something even better because, I don't know, PALISADE-2, there's maybe some COVID going on. But the counter argument would be maybe there's some expectation bias due to the positive results. So how are you thinking about the outcome of PALISADE-3 and why?\nShawn Singh: Well, I think there's a lot of reasons, of course, to be confident about our next couple of steps in the PALISADE-3 direction. First, certainly, the world isn't really controlled anywhere near to the degree it was in the pandemic, and that obviously impacts the entire ecosystem associated with executing successful clinical studies. There's a lot of lessons learned that we have been able to gather from deconstruction of PALISADE-1 for sure, and I suspect we will from PALISADE-2, things like subjects will have an olfactory smell test. They'll have - will have restrictions on use of nasal swabs upfront of the event. So there are several things that are associated with just modest amendments to the protocol, but they're positive lessons that you typically learn when you stagger start the studies. So that, plus the training that we've done, the proprietary training models that we have all up and down every aspect of conducting that type of study, I don't think there's anybody better to conduct and more expertised to conduct a public speaking challenge in a Phase 3 setting than we are. I have no reservations about that. So I really - I like our chances going into the study. I like the expertise we have internally. I like the force extenders that we've got in our network outside the company. Certainly, Dr. Liebowitz plays a key role in our ability to be successful with this clinical program with this drug. So yes, we're excited.\nAndrew Tsai: Got it. Okay. And speaking PALISADE-2, going back to the data, when could we expect you to share detailed results at a medical meeting or a publication? I mean it would be great to see the curves of SUDS and so forth. And secondly, you've compared PALISADE-2 to PALISADE-1, explained the differences. But can you also compare to the prior Phase 2 study and maybe compare and contrast any efficacy differences that you saw? Were there different baseline SUDS scores, for instance, between these two studies? Help us reconcile any differences.\nShawn Singh: Thanks. Well, first to your question about the data, this obviously falls into industry standard breaking news, so we're trying to find a nice place to present the Phase 2 data in a breaking news context. Hopefully, sometime this fall, I think would probably be the earliest. So we'll have more information on that as we go forward. Certainly, abstracts and the like are already in circulation. So - and then as to your questions about has the PALISADE-2 - or the Phase 2 studies, I mean, obviously, it's a different environment. That's the three study - or 3-site study. But Josh Prince, I want you to actually just address this just briefly, some of the things that we see.\nJoshua Prince: Yes. Thanks, Shawn. Just to fill in the space there, I think the key is the time difference. So when we think about how long it's been since those earlier Phase 2 studies were done and you think about just the environment that we live in today versus then and through the pandemic, we think that has effect. But overall, the efficacy seen for both PH94B and placebo in that Phase 2 study was everything was kind of shifted up compared to what we've seen with PALISADE-2 and PALISADE-1. I mean we really do think it has to do with kind of the - again, the times and the types of patients and conducting a study through the pandemic.\nAndrew Tsai: Thank you very much.\nJoshua Prince: Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Joanne Lee from Maxim Group. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Lee: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the successful outcomes of the recent Phase 3. The results were truly remarkable. Just given fasedienol achieved positive results in now both PAL-2 and the open label study, could you provide some insight on the rationale behind choosing to pursue both SUDS and LSAS as primary measures in the PAL-3 and FEARLESS studies? Was this decision influenced by any guidance from the FDA? Just curious on that.\nShawn Singh: No, no. Well, Thanks, Joanne, first of all, for the question. It's a great question. Look, we long held the way that we think fasedienol can help people. It's two distinct ways. It can certainly help people, as we've shown in PALISADE-2, in an acute setting. And as they take it out of their pocket or their purse or their backpack and they use it on demand in a patient-tailored way, has the ability to knock down very rapidly those symptoms. That's what PALISADE-2 showed. We also have placebo-controlled Phase 2 data and some exploratory data from the open label. Lots of subjects that also when it's used acutely but used over time, it increases the confidence of a person and increases their resilience, and it reduces their tendency to avoid situations that could benefit their lives. It reduces the opportunity costs in their life. And that avoidance - a reduction in avoidance of engaging in social and performance situations is important. The Liebowitz scale captures both of those. So we're at a perfect spot right now because we've got one successful study in Phase 3, and you only need two adequate and well-controlled studies to get an approval of a drug. And so it could either be from a PALISADE-3 or it could be from a FEARLESS. Either way, what we're trying to do is look to the most efficient path to get this drug to patients as soon as possible. And it's one of those two tracks. It could be both, but you only need one other besides the one we've got. At least that's our opinion at this point. So doing the LSAS-based study, again, it's consistent with the only three drugs ever approved for treatment of social anxiety disorder. That was the primary efficacy end point. We needed to make sure, and we did find this out in the first quarter that the FDA still believed that to be a valid and reliable end point and they do. So that provides optionality there. The other side is, well, we already know what they think about the SUDS end point and the PALISADE program. Importantly, too, we have a keen interest given that social anxiety disorders, normally the onset is typically in adolescence between, say, ages 8 and 17. There's a huge number, as we know, of minors who are affected with mental health disorders, especially social anxiety disorder. The Liebowitz Scale, there's an LSAS-CA, which is for children and adolescents, so much easier down the road when we want to extend our treatment opportunity to pediatrics to run a Liebowitz scale-based study using a modified version of that scale similar to the way that the adult study was run. Difficult to envision a 10-year-old giving a public speech to a group of strangers, just much easier to execute down the road in a pediatric setting as well. So it's really a nice combined set, either one of the 2. Ideally, we see both. And then you have a very robust commercial opportunity that extends into the pediatric arena.\nJoanne Lee: Got it. That was really helpful. And clearly, lots of excitement around the SAD program, but we're also really enthusiastic about the broader pherine platform as well. Could you shed some color on the current statuses and progress of those programs, PH10, 15 and 80, particularly on the latter, PH80, with the positive preclinical data? We see the hot flashing, other symptoms in menopause receiving a lot of - a lot more attention in the area of women's health. So curious if you could walk us through some of the time lines around those programs.\nShawn Singh: Sure. Well, first, with respect to itruvone, or PH10, that's now, after a bit of a long run, it's staged to go into Phase 2b development in the U.S. Those - the efficacy study was run outside the U.S. And so we really had to start back to the point of the U.S. IND-enabling program. For that one, because there had been no prior U.S. activity or no prior U.S. IND, we did the whole standard battery of nonclinical studies followed by a small Phase 1 to then now be able to leap back over, we believe, the Phase 2a that was done and move into Phase 2b, so tremendously exciting program given what we just also learned that, like 94B or fasedienol, there's no meaningful systemic exposure. And the kinds of safety profile benefits that we see from fasedienol are also in the itruvone zone, meaning that we didn't - we don't anticipate sexual side effects. We don't anticipate weight gain. We don't anticipate many of the types of side effects and safety concerns that are associated with the currently approved systemic therapy. So very excited about that as the stand-alone treatment for major depressive disorder. As to PH80, again, you hit it. Hot flashes is hot right now. With the new NK3 antagonist that was approved, there's been a lot more interest of late in that space. There's an enormous population course that's affected by hot flashes for many years with very limited options that don't cause some concern, whether it's hormonal therapy or the new class. PH80 is majorly distinguished from both of those current treatment options and the antidepressants that are used for hot flashes because, again, like fasedienol and itruvone, we don't believe it's systemically absorbed. We think, again, that it also has the ability with neurocircuitry that's associated with temperature to be able to reduce the daily number of hot flashes that - just as we saw in the Phase 2a study but also the severity of those hot flashes and the types of things that disrupt lives, so sweating and function and the like. So it's exciting that the challenge with that one is, like PH10, we've got to go through what probably will be about a 12 to 15 months IND-enabling program, where we do the CMC work and the preclinical work that's needed to get back into a Phase 2b setting. The difference with this one is that there is a - there were - there was a prior U.S. IND. So we don't think we need to do a Phase 1 study in order to get into Phase 2b for this indication. So will be - it's not a long - it's not a lot of money, less than $2 million for these IND-enabling programs. We have to do similar work with PH15 and PH284, the other two pherine assets in the pipeline. So that's the status of both.\nJoanne Lee: Got it. Thank you for all the additional details. Once again, congratulations and looking forward to more updates this year.\nShawn Singh: Thanks, Joanne.\nOperator: And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Andrew Tsai with Jefferies. Andrew, your line is live. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Tsai: Thank you. Just a couple of more questions. Thank you so much for the time. I mean going back to PALISADE-2, there does seem to be a consistent efficacy signal across various end points. So I just wanted to make sure, were there other prespecified efficacy measures part of the study? And if so, how did those look? Just wanted to make sure all pre-specified measures are separated from placebo in a stat sig manner. Thanks.\nShawn Singh: Sorry, Andrew. Were - you asked if there is a separation against placebo across all the end points. Yes, there was one secondary - the primary, one secondary and two exploratories, and we reported on all those, so four total.\nAndrew Tsai: Okay. Great. And going to the label - the eventual label, if both PALISADE and FEARLESS succeeded, what would your eventual label look like for SAD? And would there be precedents around that label claim? Thank you.\nShawn Singh: No, there is no precedent for the acute treatment for social anxiety disorder. We would be the first to blaze that trail with fasedienol. Drugs are used. Benzodiazepines, for example, try to achieve that but with considerable risk of abuse and misuse and addiction. But they're never - they're not approved for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. So only the three antidepressants: two SSRIs and one wellness, and they are approved for the chronic condition. There likely would be no limit, in our opinion, on how frequently somebody could use the drug acutely if it's PALISADE-2 plus PALISADE-3 that supports the label initially. If it's later, eventually, FEARLESS came along and the staggered starts, which we - is what we anticipate with PALISADE-3 first and FEARLESS second sometime in '24. It would be a case where the drug would be used acutely as needed but over time. And what you'd try to achieve for someone ultimately at the end of the day is they wouldn't have to take the drug. That's often and hopefully still also combined with talk therapy. So yes, the PALISADE-2 hits the acute side of that match set. FEARLESS would hit the over time, although certainly, people wouldn't be precluded from using fasedienol over time if what's achieved is only the acute label.\nAndrew Tsai: Got it. And really quickly, as we think about the NDA package in the future, any peripheral studies that you would need to do such as, I guess, repeat - just multiple dosing per day kind of studies, for instance? Thank you.\nShawn Singh: Sure. So we'll do open-label extensions on each of the 2, the PALISADE-3 and the FEARLESS study, so that there still has to be a safety database that gets established. And then the readout study that you mentioned, so I think that's something we've reported before. FDA wants to see what happens if someone uses the drug twice instead of just once in that acute setting. So that's something we will - before NDA, that's a small study that we'd likely be completing and most likely they'd be using a public speaking challenge as well. So not too many subjects, not too expensive, but again, trying to - not so much for safety, and we don't really worry about multiple uses in a short period of time, but I think there is some interest at the agency and wondering whether more is better. We've certainly established the 3.2 micrograms used PRN is good in PALISADE-2. So if better is available, great, but it won't be an essential component for going forward in PALISADE-3 or the FEARLESS study.\nAndrew Tsai: Got it. Actually, very last one, because you don't have much opportunity on conference calls. So in the study results, did PH94B work equally as well between male and females? And that's the last question. Thank you.\nShawn Singh: I think that's something we'll be able to unpack. We don't have the full data set fully unpacked. We have the top line results. So that takes a little bit of time. But I don't think we see - and we've long held since - that was, I think, long, long time ago that, that was a question. But we think - we don't think there's any reason to believe the drug doesn't work as well in women as in men or men as an women, whichever way you want to put it. But FEARLESS will give us - okay.\nAndrew Tsai: Okay. Thanks. Congrats.\nShawn Singh: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no other sell-side analysts in queue. You may proceed to closing comments.\nMark Flather: Excellent. Thank you, Jennifer for your help today. And thank you, Andrew, and Joanne. We appreciate your questions.
