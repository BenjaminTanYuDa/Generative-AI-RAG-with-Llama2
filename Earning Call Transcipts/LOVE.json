        "content": "Operator: Greetings, welcome to Lovesac's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please not this conference is being recorded. At this time I’ll turn the conference over to Elizabeth Schnoerr. Ms. Schnoerr, you may now begin.\nElizabeth Schnoerr: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. With me on the call is Shawn Nelson, Chief Executive Officer; Mary Fox, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Keith Siegner, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some of the information discussed will include forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future financial performance. These include statements about our future expectations, financial projections, and our plans and prospects. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the company's filings with the SEC, which includes today's press release. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions and beliefs as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them, except as required by applicable law. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from our GAAP results. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to such non-GAAP financial measure has been provided as supplemental financial information in our press release. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Shawn Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of The Lovesac Company.\nShawn Nelson: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start this call off by reviewing the highlights of our third quarter fiscal 2024, briefly providing an update on our operational accomplishments and finishing up with our outlook. Then Mary Fox, our President and COO, will update you on the progress we made against our strategic initiatives. And finally, Keith Siegner, our CFO who will review our financial results and a few other items related to our outlook in more detail. Turning to the highlights of our results. Not a lot has changed since we spoke with you four weeks ago. Lovesac continues to deliver strong financial results and category outperformance, backed by a very strong balance sheet. For third quarter, we're pleased to confirm top and bottom line results that were in line with the outlook provided on our second quarter call on November 3. The headline is that third quarter net sales grew double-digits in a double-digit negative category. To be clear, the macro backdrop largely remains the same as last month. Lingering macro uncertainty leads to consumer caution and pressure on the furniture category, which we estimate was down mid to high-teens in the third quarter. However, our playbook also remains largely unchanged and continues to deliver. Our disruptive, design for life platforms, impactful product innovation, compelling marketing, and highly productive omni-channel footprint continue to distinguish our unique brand and engender customer love and loyalty. More specifically, for the third quarter, total net sales were $154 million, up 14.3% versus the prior year period and 32% on a two-year basis. Omni-channel comparable net sales growth was 2% for the quarter, a key metric for how we evaluate and manage our unique omni-channel business. We delivered gross margin expansion and substantial abatement in SG&A deleverage as expected, which led to materially improved profitability, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA reached a positive $2.5 million, compared to a negative $6.9 million in the prior year period. Net loss is also improved to $2 million, compared to a net loss of $7 million in Q3 last year. And that's despite non-recurring expenses related to the restatement that are called out in our press release. The Lovesac team continues to execute across all our priorities, including our innovation agenda, physical footprint expansion, omni-channel experience from order to delivery, and marketing efficiencies. Mary will discuss in more detail the progress of these growth strategies in a moment. As we look to the final quarter of the year, which includes the all-important holiday selling weeks. I'd like to note the following: the macro environment and in turn the discretionary home category has remained challenging. As we said on our last call, we are not planning for any meaningful recovery and category growth in the near-term. And yes, as expected, the promotional environment was more competitive over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday periods than last year. But as we discussed with you last month, we adapted our plans, increasing the discount slightly and delivering relevant and distinctive marketing with strong gross margins to boot. Taking all that into account and with the Black Friday and Cyber Week events behind us, I'm happy to say that Lovesac has continued to grow and outperform the category. As a result, we are further tightening our full-year net sales guidance range now $710 million to $720 million, which represents high-single to nearly double-digit growth even excluding the impact of the 53rd week this year a truly standout performance. We are not ready to provide guidance for fiscal 2025 today. However, we will prudently control expenses and with a focus on efficiency, balanced against proactive investments in new products to drive profitable growth. In summary, we are pleased to deliver third quarter results that were in line with our expectations and which, once again, are ahead of the competition. The operational progress we are making against our growth strategies, along with disciplined investments in key foundational areas like technology, new product innovation, and insights continue to fortify our flywheel, thereby driving consumer demand and expanding our market leadership, which we believe can last well into the future. Finally, I want to thank the entire Lovesac team for their tireless execution of our strategies and delivery of our goals, especially during this critical time of year. Our disruptive model enables us to continue to grow, thrive, innovate and invest in this business. But it is our people, who ensure an outstanding customer experience and are the reason that our Lovesac family is growing so steadily as we enjoy a great holiday season together. With that, I will hand it over to Mary to cover our strategic priorities and progress in more detail. Mary?\nMary Fox: Thank you, Shawn, and good morning everyone. As Shawn discussed, with sales growth of 14.3% our quarter three results again reflected industry-leading growth driven by our unique omni-channel business model. Importantly, on a four-year basis, our sales dropped 196% from pre-pandemic levels. And our adjusted EBITDA margin has increased 880 basis points over the same time period. Category outperformance has continued this quarter with strength and demand versus last year during Cyber 5, from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. And we are very pleased with our early results. Some highlights from Cyber 5 include having our two largest sales days and the largest week in our history. We believe this peak in sales that is unique to our business within our category is due in part to our investment in building a brand that is unmatched in the furniture category, coupled with delivery to customers' homes in just a few days. Our clear strategy for growth and the team's consistent execution against our growth strategies allows us to continue to fuel our flywheel and drive operational excellence across the business. I will now share the highlights of our operational progress in quarter three. Firstly, starting with product innovation. During quarter three, we expanded distribution of our newly launched Angled Side, which is now available across our showroom base, as well as our e-comm platform. And we're very happy with the impact and feedback. Angled Side performance is even above our original expectations, which were ambitious, emphasizing how it is a meaningful driver of our overall continued growth and category out performance. As I shared before, we partnered with Architectural Digest to launch Angled Side to the consumer and designer world. The event was well attended by influencers, as well as media outlets such as Vogue and Glamour, and of course, Architectural Digest. In addition to generating over 1 billion impressions, the event was surrounded by Architectural Digest paid media, further empowering the success we've seen since launch. In short, we're very happy with the early performance of Angled Side as it's approaching becoming Lovesac’s number one style choice after only a few months. We're also launching some strong collaborations into the holidays, including a partnership with Nordstrom and Swarovski to develop a foot sack that will be featured within Nordstrom and on nordstrom.com this holiday. We continue to demonstrate that we will gain market share through our new product introductions and brand collaborations. As awareness and appreciation continue to grow, all of which reinforce the strength of our customer-centric business model. Our Omnichannel experience, this model is driven by a combination of our physical touchpoints in our digital platform. During third quarter, we opened 10 showrooms and 16 Best Buy, shop-in-shop. With regards to our Best Buy partnership, sales were up 42.8% in quarter three, driven by increased shop-in-shop presence versus last year. Our e-commerce channel performance continued to show strong growth and increased 20% for last year, and contributing meaningfully to our category outperformance. Our omnichannel model and investments into touchpoint and website to technology continues to drive improved customer satisfaction scores as we continuously monitor feedback and improve the overall customer shopping experience. We made significant improvements to the website shopping experience before entering our holiday code freeze, including new configurators to ease the customer rebuy journey, updates to post purchase experience, and platform security enhancement. Strong collaboration across touch points and e-commerce enable us to continuously improve the omnichannel experience. Third is our brand ecosystem. At the center of our ecosystem lies our efficient marketing and effective rival brand awareness, familiarity, love, and ultimately customer acquisition, which supports our strong customer lifetime values to customer acquisition cost ratio. Overall, we continue to be agile with our marketing mix as the backdrop for customers interaction with our category continues to change. Let me share a few highlights of what we've been working on. For awareness more broadly, increasing efficiency in achieving reach enabled us to drive reach and also improve targeting simultaneously. Live sports up front are a key example of this improvement. While on this subject, hopefully you all have seen our newest commercial that tested very strongly across all metrics. We continue to closely scrutinize digital marketing program optimizations to our SEM and social programs, which have driven improvements in our overall ad exposure and cost metrics, along with improving conversion rates and ROI. We've had strong success with some social partnerships that reinforce the resonance of our brand with culture. Charli D'Amelio posted from her new home on Lovesac products she'd requested and as you know, she has more than 151 million followers on TikTok and over 9 million YouTube subscribers. We collaborated with Justin Pugh on a special sack when his Saturday Night Football intro referenced straight off the couch. And these two collaborations garnered over 35 million impressions and are just a few examples of the work our team are doing building brand love and stickiness. And not to be forgotten, direct mail campaigns once again delivered strong ROI's for us and not only drove customer acquisition, but aided increasing lifetime value of our customers. Lastly, we were really excited to see that Esquire named Feltech one of its best 37 gadgets for 2023. Yes, that is right, a couch made the best gadgets list, reinforcing the strength of design for life products powered by technology. And finally, disciplined infrastructure investments and efficiencies. During quarter three, we continued to make investments in technology and research and development as we scale our business for the long-term. We completed the national rollout of PredictSpring, our new POS system, in all of our touchpoints. This rollout enhances the customer experience through speed of transactions and unlocks new and modern payment options like pay-by-link capability. Our quick delivery continues to drive customer satisfaction and our investments in supply chain, which we remain on track to deliver by the end of this year are expected to help drive inventory productivity improvements of 20%, as we have previously stated. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to make progress on our circular operations and open box inventory as we focus on improving the executional effectiveness and brand experience. And we are seeing over 48% improvement in units back to stock versus last year. As a result of these initiatives, we expect to see improvements in working capital, as well as associated cost reductions across inbound freight and warehousing, which we saw in quarter three and will continue to realize in quarter four. Investments in Gladly, our customer service platform, has allowed us to better serve customers as part of our sales and service strategy, driving over 8 points of increase in C-LOG customer satisfaction scores in quarter three over the same quarter last year, and an impressive increase in service performance versus last year during Cyber 5. We are laser focused on operational excellence and we will continue to manage our cost structure and capital allocation as we deliver operational performance ahead of our competitors. In summary, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter and our continued and consistent track record of market share gains. I want to echo Shawn’s gratitude to our amazing team members for helping drive these financial and operational outcomes. For the big holiday weeks that we just covered and the ones to come, one thing that is certain is that we are ready for them and look forward to closing out our fiscal year having built on our market share gains, expanded our physical footprints with highly productive locations, improved our digital go-to-market position, made important infrastructure investments, and doing all of this while advancing our innovation agenda. I will now pass the call over to Keith to review our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Keith?\nKeith Siegner: Thanks, Mary. Let's jump right into a quick review of the third quarter followed by our outlook for the rest of fiscal ‘24. Net sales increased $19.2 million or 14.3% to $154 million in the third quarter of fiscal ‘24, with the year-over-year increase being driven by web and showrooms. This was in line with what we projected for the quarter, driven by our 25th anniversary celebration and the launch of Angled Side. Showroom net sales increased $15.7 million or 18.9% to $98.7 million in the third quarter, as compared to $83 million in the prior year period. The increase in showroom sales was driven by an increase of 2% in omnichannel comparable net sales growth related to higher point of sale transactions with higher promotional discounting than the prior year, as well as the net addition of 41 net new showrooms, compared to the prior year period. You'll notice that beginning this quarter, we've replaced previously provided comparable sales growth metrics with a new metric omnichannel comparable net sales growth. This is the metric most closely aligned with how we evaluate and manage the financial performance of our omnichannel business. It also eliminates noise caused through the inclusion of demand-based metrics in the past, such as orders placed, but that have not been shipped, and should therefore be far more useful for your models. Internet net sales increased $6.7 million or 20.1% to $40 million in the third quarter of fiscal ‘24, as compared to $33.3 million in the prior year period. Other net sales, which include pop-up shop, shop-in shop and open box inventory transactions, decreased $3.1 million or 17.1% to $15.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal ‘24. The decrease was principally due to a lower open box inventory transaction level, only $2.5 million, compared to $4.2 million in the third quarter fiscal ‘23. Our open-box inventory transactions with ICON are a part of our circular operations, design for life, and ESG initiatives. As we discussed last quarter, these transactions are waning in materiality as our initiatives to optimize our process for return product kick in. This better aligns with our sustainability goals and should retain more profits for Lovesac at the same time. We may engage in limited open-box inventory transactions with ICON going forward to ensure that our warehouses are operating as efficiently as possible. By product category, in the third quarter, our Sactional net sales increased 18%. SAC net sales decreased 10% and our other net sales, which includes decorative pillows, blankets, and accessories, decreased 15% over the prior year. Gross margin increased 920 basis points to 57.4% of net sales in the third quarter versus 48.2% in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a decrease of 1,070 basis points in total distribution and related tariff expenses. This was offset partially by 150 basis points of pressure from higher promotional discounting. The decrease in total distribution and related tariff expenses over the prior year is principally related to the positive impact of 1,160 basis points decrease in inbound transportation costs, partially offset by 90 basis points in higher outbound transportation and warehousing costs. SG&A expense as a percent of net sales increased by 420 basis points in the third quarter or half the deleverage seen in the second quarter. The deleverage was primarily due to deleverage within employment costs, selling related expenses tied to the Lovesac credit card, continued investments to support current and future growth, and also professional fees. In dollars, overhead expenses increased $10 million, consisting mainly of increases of $6.3 million in professional fees and $3.7 million in infrastructure investments in other miscellaneous items. Employment costs increased by $2.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in new hires in fiscal ‘24. Selling related expenses increased $1.5 million, principally due to credit card fees related to the increase in net sales and an increase in credit card rates. We estimate non-recurring incremental fees associated with the restatement of prior period financials was approximately $1.7 million in the third quarter. Advertising and marketing expenses increased $2 million, or 10.8%, to $21.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal ‘24, compared to $19.1 million in the prior year period. Advertising and marketing expenses were 13.7% of net sales in the third quarter, as compared to 14.1% of net sales in the prior year period. Operating loss for the quarter was $3.6 million, compared to operating loss of $10.1 million in the third quarter of last year, driven by the factors we just discussed. Before we turn our attention to net loss, net loss per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA, please refer to the terminology and reconciliation between each of our adjusted metrics and their most directly comparable GAAP measurements in our earnings release issued earlier this morning. Net loss for the quarter was $2.3 million or negative $0.15 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million or negative $0.48 per diluted share in the prior year period. During the third quarter of fiscal ‘24, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1 million, as compared to $2.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal ‘23. The change in benefit is primarily driven by the reduction in net loss for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was an income of $2.5 million, as compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $6.9 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was ahead of our expectations, principally driven by the upside to gross margins. Turning to our balance sheet, our total merchandise inventory levels are in line with our projections and have leveled out as we discussed on our prior call. This is despite the addition of Angled Side skews, and we believe this is a clear highlight of the uniqueness of our business model. We feel exceptionally good about both the quality and quantity of our inventory and our ability to maintain industry-leading in-stock positions and delivery times. We ended the third quarter with a very healthy balance sheet inclusive of $37.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, as well as $36 million in availability on our evolving line of credit with no borrowings. Please refer to our earnings press release for other details on our third quarter financial performance. So now our outlook and let's start with the fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate net sales of $260 million to 270 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA between $48 million to $56 million. This includes gross margins just under 60%, merchandising and advertising of 10.5% to 11% as a percentage of net sales, and SG&A of 31% to 32% as a percent of net sales. We estimate net income to be $29 million to $33 million. This includes approximately $1.5 million of non-recurring incremental expenses associated with our restatement of prior period financial statements. We estimate diluted income per share is expected to be $1.77 to $2.02 with $16.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Now for the full-year fiscal 2024. We are tightening the range of our full-year outlook for net sales to $710 million to $720 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA between $54 million and $62 million. This includes gross margins of $57 million to $57.5 million, merchandising and advertising of approximately 13% as a percentage of net sales, and SG&A of approximately 38% as a percentage of net sales. We estimate net income to be between $22 million and $26 million. These fiscal 2024 estimates include $4.5 million to $5 million of non-recurring incremental expenses associated with our restatement of prior period financial statements. We estimate diluted income for common share in the range of $1.35 to $1.60, and approximately $16.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, the 53rd week in the fourth quarter is expected to contribute approximately $6 million in net sales. Quickly on our cash balance outlook, we were very pleased to have reported such a strong cash position for the third quarter, which is typically our lowest quarter-ending cash balance of the year, given the inventory build ahead of the strong holiday sales period. As we monetize inventory through the busy season, we continue to estimate we will end fiscal ‘24 with a higher net cash balance than we ended fiscal ‘23. So in conclusion, we're pleased with our third quarter results and how early holiday sales have supported the continuation of competitively superior results as is reflected in our outlook. Market share gains, strengthening foundations, exciting new growth drivers, and a healthy balance sheet put Lovesac in an enviable position. The more I get to know the teams, the more excited I get about our collective commitment to optimizing the opportunity ahead of us. With a strong focus on growth underpinned by an ROI-based approach to measured reinvestment, I'm confident in the outlook. Now, I'll turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question Today is from the line of Maria Ripps with Canaccord Genuity. Pleased proceed with your questions.\nMaria Ripps: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. First, recognizing that it's still pretty early and you're not guiding to next year, but maybe can you talk about sort of your current expectations for the category growth and consumer demand next year? And what kind of macro assumptions are embedded in your sort of internal forecast for next year?\nMary Fox: Hey, Maria, lovely to hear from you. Thank you for the question. Yes, as obviously we're fully focused on quarter four and this all-important holiday season, we'll share more when we come through to our earnings for quarter four. In terms of our plans for next year, we still anticipate the macro environment will be choppy and the category will be remaining challenging. And we have planned that way. But as we've demonstrated with our results, this year, last year, we continue to obviously really outperform the category, really driving tremendous growth. And I think just so much of that goes back to the fact our brand's strengths continue to just really grow. I think our customers, even just being out in the showroom last week, they just love the brand, they believe in design for life. So we're planned to continue to be pragmatic, prudent in terms of our investments with obviously a deep focus on ROI. But obviously as soon as things turn, we hope it will as the categories start to improve, then we'll be the ones that will be the fastest to be able to chase into that growth. We saw it through COVID, so we feel good. And obviously, that's the advantage of our supply chain.\nKeith Siegner: Yes, just Maria, this is Keith. Just to add to that a little bit, I mean, that's one of the really, really alluring aspects of this business model to me. Because of our approach not being merchandise led, but primarily selling seats and sides and sacks with the various covers, our ability to scale up with upside surprises to the macro is really advantageous. Starting from a position of shipping in less than two weeks, even if we needed to potentially extend that a tiny bit in order to, if it was a really material upside macro surprise, we could do so. So we sort of retain the ability to participate in upside macro surprises in a way that I think is sort of unmatched.\nMaria Ripps: Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, sort of, you've made a lot of progress on gross margin expansion over the past couple of quarters. Can you maybe talk about your philosophy around preserving that margin versus maybe passing on some of the savings to the consumer to drive volume, especially kind of here in the near-term in this macro environment?\nKeith Siegner: Sure. I'll start off on this one. So, yes, we've been really pleased with this, and there's a whole host of factors behind it that we walked through on the call -- that I walk through on the call earlier. And you can see as we get into fourth quarter with the guidance that we gave, that we're looking for continued gross margin expansion through the fourth quarter. Let's call it heavily rounded half the benefit year-over-year that we saw here in the third quarter. But I think I would say this, we've sort of settled into where we think is a healthy range for us. It -- barring any material shocks, whether it's on inbound freight or outbound freight, you know, there's always potential for some type of systemic shock, but barring anything like that, I think we feel pretty good about this. Then what it becomes for us is a balancing act across pricing, across promotions, across managing all of those inbound and outbound freight cross, plus how we leverage our marketing and our ineffective promotions we offer through the financing through the Lovesac credit card. So put it all together, I think these feel like pretty sustainable and healthy levels for us, again, barring any systemic shock.\nMaria Ripps: Got it. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. Nice start to the holiday season. Congrats.\nShawn Nelson: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks. The first question I want to ask, and I think it's a bit of a follow-up just to that prior gross margin question. You mentioned in the comments, and we've heard this elsewhere too, that it's more promotional out there. It's more of a promotional backdrop. So I guess the question I have with regard to gross margin, as we look at the results we've put up today for Q3 and the guidance for Q4. To what degree your consumers react more favorably to price promotions? And how much of a driver is you to that strategically? How much of a driver of the business has that become?\nShawn Nelson: Yes, look, I think promotions are the very powerful tool in our arsenal, especially given our high growth margins to begin with and the competitive nature of our unique products. We try to be very strategic with them. As you know, we are trying to build a business that’s here forever for 50-years. We are trying to build a generational brand, and a brand that means something. And so we have long leveraged promotions at fairly healthy levels, because in this industry in particular, it's a considered purchase. And so people spend quite a long time researching products, researching competitors, researching our product before they make the decision to purchase. And what we found, especially during the holidays, is while our business spikes, as we all know during Q4, kind of, uniquely in our category. Lovesac and sometimes we look at that, you know, is that a blessing or a curse? But we enjoy the extra business that comes by the exposure being out there in shopping centers during this time of year when there's foot traffic, et cetera. But actually most of those sales as we observe them and as I observe them in the wilds, you know, in -- on the front lines and showrooms come from these considered processes where customers are weighing the value. And then frankly, they leverage the holiday season to push them over the edge and make that purchase finally for themselves. It actually most of the time is not a gift or even related to gifting. It's just kind of a psychological excuse to purchase. And so during this time of year in particular, the way that we manage promotions is really critical, because we have people that have been shopping us, maybe throughout the entire year and finally pulled the trigger and are waiting to see if they might get better, et cetera. So we've exercised, I think, a pretty disciplined hand this season, particularly, because it's maybe the most promotional season it's ever been, at least in recent history, given the industry right now. And so our promotions are lower than what we observe by really any of our competitors. And as you can see by the numbers we are competing very robustly. I think we probably have the strongest growth in the category. And so we think we have that right balance of promotion and that healthy fundamentals in the business for the category right now. And the nice thing is, should things in the category get worse or just continue to languish, we have a strong opportunity to leverage promotions further to drive the business if necessary. But we are not chasing business to chase business. Again, we're trying to balance building a brand that people can love and trust and have consistency, as well as, of course, compete in real time and generate cash and generate profits, returns for investors.\nMary Fox: I think Shawn, just maybe Brian to add a little bit more. I mean, what we see as well is consumers, they love the deal and the excitement of that deal, but it doesn't mean about the lowest price. And we've shared with you before nearly 40% of consumers that come into our brand. They don't even crop up with anyone else. So we feel very good in terms of gross margin and of being maintained. We have been doing some selective price increases in places as we've [Technical Difficulty] particularly on our more premium fills, and we've seen great performance from that. So we're constantly adjusting the leases that we have available. And as you can see from our results, gaining huge market shares, outperforming everyone else, then this algorithm has been working for us. We saw from the Goldman Sachs report yesterday, the promotional level was high through quarter three at about 40% and at a similar level through November, and we are substantially lower. So I think, again, just [Technical Difficulty] we do feel good on the gross margins.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. That's very helpful. My follow-up question, a different topic. So I think it was Mary, I think you were talking, your comments is about the -- or highlighting, I guess, the ongoing success of the relationship with Best Buy. So the question I have is, I know you're always here as a company very guarded by your future plans. But should we expect additional newer distribution type partnerships with companies like Best Buy to help basically get the Lovesac products out there?\nMary Fox: Yes, no. Before I think, where we always want to be is best-in-class partners where, you know, consumers, it's really on their minds we make [Technical Difficulty] purchase. So Costco's obviously been an incredible partner for us [Technical Difficulty] particularly as we advance. We're home meets tech, there's no one better to partner within Best Buy. We want to be with [Technical Difficulty]. So yes, we've continued to expand the relationship with Best Buy and more to come. And we'll share more, obviously, the end of this year. So we're gaining share. They're very happy in terms of relationships and want to continue to advance it. And then we're always considering, Brian, in terms of any other best-in-class partners that we should be partnering with as you consider the whole ecosystem whether it be showrooms, whether it be Costco, Best Buy, you know, our own e-com platform just where should we be and where are those footsteps that are either always on our minds strategically, but very thoughtful how we do it to ensure that we really try [Technical Difficulty] way that we believe and consumers expect to find us.\nBrian Nagel: Very helpful. Congrats again, happy holidays. Thanks.\nMary Fox: Yes, thank you, Brian. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Matt Koranda with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt Koranda: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to spin back to the Black Friday, Cyber Monday commentary, the holiday commentary in general that you had. Just wondering if you could maybe speak to sort of consumer behavior that you're observing. One of the things we've seen sort of quarter-to-date from a number of folks is that consumers seem to be responding to promotions, but then kind of sitting on their hands in between those promotional periods? So I'm just curious if that's the trend that you're seeing? And then any willingness to sort of quantify the Black Friday, Cyber Monday growth that you said, I know you mentioned two record days and a record week, but any further quantification would be appreciated there?\nMary Fox: Yes, no. Thank you for the question, Matt. So I think first thing, we were incredibly happy with our performance of Cyber 5, as you mentioned. And from all industry reports, we know we outperformed the category significantly upon a lot of market share. I think in terms of dynamics all of our channels contribute to this strong performance. It really felt like we were back to 2019, strong traffic showrooms, e-commerce growth well into the late evening and it was great being back in the front line. I think we saw consumers coming in that had done their research, were very focused in what they wanted to buy. And as we said with you back in the last call a month ago, we're not seeing anything in terms of trade down or some trade up, particularly in the fill, but also just storage [Technical Difficulty] seats and other things that really drive up AOV. So that continued financing. Trust that's all continued. I think as you talked about, you know, were people waiting for sure? And we saw that across the industry with others coming out with deals even earlier than Halloween. So we were a little bit later. We promised that we gave them the best deal, and we were holding to that, and we did. So you can see a little bit more of that pent-up demand coming, which is obviously the results that we've had. So super happy from obviously everything we've done and we've baked all of that performance into our guidance for this year. We're a third of the way [Technical Difficulty] taught us a lot to come, but it was obviously amazing to see the performance and just really reinforcing the brand's presence and just great job to our teams. I mean managing those record days is our little showroom with incredible productivity. It was great to sit in and they did an amazing job.\nMatt Koranda: Okay, very helpful Mary, and thank you. And then maybe for Keith, just on the gross margin, I want to do a tagger from a different angle. So in the third quarter, you had an upside surprise versus sort of the commentary that you had last call. Just wondering what drove the upside and then for the fourth quarter in terms of product margin are we baking in a deeper headwind in that sub-60 outlook that you talked about just maybe talk about the bridge especially as it pertains to product margin in the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nKeith Siegner: Yes, sure. So starting with the third quarter and where maybe some of that upside came from, I think it gets back to what Mary was just saying, which is we've been seeing some decent premium upgrades, things like Lovesoft, things like storage seats and add-ons along those lines, as well as a little bit more shift towards Sactionals within the mix of product versus where we might have been. The surgical price increases we've been taking on certain of those products has also been beneficial. It's not been broad-based or materially large in terms of price increase, but put the whole package together and that got us a little upside on the quarter. When you're thinking about fourth quarter, really what's happening is we're lapping some of the abatement of the inbound freight costs that we're really pressuring last year. That's why we're seeing less of a year-over-year benefit in the Q4. It's more the easing of the tailwind on a year-over-year basis that's causing that deceleration and expansion. You'll notice that, like we do get a higher absolute gross margin in Q4 than Q3, because we do get some leverage. The higher sales gives us some leverage over things like warehouse costs and so on and so forth. But that's why what I was saying earlier was when we think about holistically where we are in gross margins here in these high-50s, This feels like a good level for a full-year basis for us and barring any systemic shocks. I think the way the business is trending, we feel good here.\nMatt Koranda: Okay, much appreciated and best of luck for holiday guys. Thanks.\nKeith Siegner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital. Please Proceed with your questions.\nAlex Fuhrman: Hey guys, thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong year. You know, Mary, I think you mentioned a couple times and Shawn, you know, touched on as well that you set new records for peak days and weeks here during the holiday season so far. You know, you guys have done a really good job historically over the last couple of years of being able to handle those volumes without any, kind of, shipping delays or anything like that. But can you talk about the profitability of those orders on peak days? Are there any incremental costs that you start to incur when you're operating near your peak capacity and, you know, would it be more profitable if there were ways to smooth out demand a little bit more?\nMary Fox: Yes, no, thank you, Alex. Great question. And yes, it was phenomenal thing those record performances. I think, you know, the team had planned for everything and as we go through different scenarios and working with our last marketing partners, you know, we'd come to that capacity. So therefore there wasn't any incremental cost, you know, that really came in. So, from that side, certainly, you know, to what we planned for, and the team did a great job smoothing that through. I think the second piece, you know, as we think about [Technical Difficulty] we talked about predict spring, we completed that full rollout, and that's significantly improving the speed of transaction. So when you have five or six customers in a showroom on those peak days or even more, just having that speed and the technology to be able to transact has really, really helped. You know, web performance, you know, customers often choose to then, you know, convert at home and close the sale. So again, just back to the reinforcement of the omni-Chanel model, but nothing that we see in terms of any profitability impact. It was as we planned.\nAlex Fuhrman: Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you, Mary.\nMary Fox: Thank you, Alex. Operator The next question is from Thomas Forte. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Forte: Great, thanks. So, Shawn, Mary, and Keith, congrats on the quarter and strong start to the fourth quarter. So two questions, the first one is, can you give your updated thoughts on your ability to generate free cash flow and your thoughts on what you intend to do with the free cash flow as you advance the model?\nKeith Siegner: Absolutely. So and I appreciate the question, thanks. So we're looking to provide more details about this with Q4 earnings when we get into the outlook for next year. But I think little bits and pieces of everything we've been talking about are sort of starting to lay the foundations for how we're going to approach this on a go-forward basis, which is as we transition into generating more substantial free cash flow off of seats and sides and sacks, it's how do we appropriately balance the reinvestment in the future sales growth drivers with other options for that cash flow. So we fully anticipate ending this year having been in a cash generative position. New systems and other tools and optimization programs are being put in place all the time. We are going to balance that, as Shawn has said, as Mary has said, and I have said, against those future sales drivers. Our goal is to translate more of the top line growth to bottom line growth going forward and that should create more cash flow out of the business, which we can use strategically along those balance lines I was just talking about.\nThomas Forte: Great. Thanks, Keith. And then you've pretty consistently generated a lot of market share gains. Shawn, you've talked in the past about your ability to consistently outperform the market at high-teens, perhaps low-20 percentage point rate. I wanted to talk about the source of the market share. Do you feel like you're getting market share from the same players or do you think it's changed over time?\nShawn Nelson: Yes, that's a great question. It's hard for us to know for sure, but our observation from the category, and we try very hard to stay abreast of every player who sells couches. You know, that's our core business. And therefore, any firm that sells couches, we consider a competitor. And we track them all. I think that, I think there's, kind of, in our world, there are two main buckets of competition. And remember, of course, we are operating at a certain price point, but this brand, Lovesac stretches across, I think fairly broad demographics, because we can sell to the very high-end customer, who has a massive home and is excited to put a 20 seat Sactionals with Stealth Tech in their basement or entertainment room. And we can sell to Middle America where this is their main piece of furniture and we pull them up to our price point through the real value that Sactionals create. And so we compete with all of the established brands in home that we maybe be in the mall with or otherwise, we compete with brand new startups to kind of copycat the Sactionals format, modularity, et cetera, and try to mimic that value prop. And so I think that in this environment, we're taking market share from all of them. And as you can see with most of our competitors, negative growth and obviously our positive growth, we are certainly taking market share. So I think that it ebbs and flows based on the health of that marketplace. And for instance, I think that in startup land, capital is much more dear than it was over the last number of years. And so they're not spending in necessarily the same ways across the board, just chasing growth. And I think the incumbents have some of their own problems to deal with in this environment where there is still a massive hangover in the home category. Meanwhile, we have very low, within the category that is, this category is known for very low aided awareness and it's very fragmented. And so, we are taking market share based on the competitor's unaided awareness. It's hard for furniture brands to gain real brand awareness, because consumers buy from furniture brands and home brands sporadically and sometimes with years in between. And therefore, as you observed Lovesac’s strategy of building a brand in between, leveraging pop culture, being in the zeitgeist through celebrity, influencer, of course, our very sticky brand name, all of these things give us strength where I think many of our competitors can't mimic that aspect of what we do and how we do things. And I think the SAC is a major player in establishing that brand. So for all these reasons, I think that we certainly are taking [Indiscernible] share. It's hard for us to pin down exactly where and who it's coming from. And I think that does change based on the state of the category, which also has been in flux recently.\nThomas Forte: Great, Thanks for taking my questions.\nShawn Nelson: Great to hear from you.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. I'll hand the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nShawn Nelson: Yes, thank you so much for joining The Lovesac 3Q conference call for fiscal 2024. We look forward to reporting again at the wrap up of our fiscal year and we want to just thank investors and all of the #LovesacFamily for building this brand that we hope so [Indiscernible].\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Rachel Schacter of ICR. Please go ahead.\nRachel Schacter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. With me on the call is Shawn Nelson, Chief Executive Officer; Mary Fox, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Keith Siegner, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some of the information discussed will include forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future financial performance. These include statements about our future expectations, financial projections, and our plans and prospects. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the company's filings with the SEC, which includes today's press release. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions and beliefs as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them, except as required by applicable law. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from our GAAP results. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to such non-GAAP financial measure has been provided as supplemental financial information in our press release. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Shawn Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of The Lovesac Company.\nShawn Nelson: Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will start this call off by reviewing the highlights of our second quarter fiscal 2024, briefly providing an update on our operational accomplishments and finishing up with our outlook. Then Mary Fox, our President and COO, will update you on the progress we made against our strategic initiatives. And finally, Keith Siegner, our new CFO will review our financial results and a few other items related to our outlook in more detail. Before diving in, I want to thank everybody for their patience as we work through our financial restatement. We hold ourselves to very high standards of integrity, accuracy and reliability of our financial statements is paramount. As of today, all amended filings are complete. Additionally, we're enhancing teams and implementing procedures and disciplines as we work to build a world-class organization able to support growth for years to come. Moving on to our results. We're pleased with our second quarter performance with top and bottom line exceeding our initial outlook provided in June. The economic environment remained challenging as macro pressures drove a more cautious consumer in turn, keeping pressure on the home category. While we also felt pressure, Lovesac operated from a position of strength, leveraging our 25th anniversary campaign and omnichannel expansion to continue our track record of outperforming the category and achieving positive net sales growth. Not to be overlooked, we delivered growth despite a difficult comparison lapping top line growth of 45% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Specifically, total net sales were $154.5 million, up 4% versus the prior year period, supported by total comparable sales growth of 7.2% for the quarter. On a two-year basis, net sales grew an impressive 51%. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.3 million as compared to $12.3 million in the prior year period. As expected, gross margin expansion was more than offset by important investments in growth. Deleverage in marketing and advertising resulted from our 25th anniversary celebrity campaign and the launch and support of our Angled Side innovation, both of which will benefit us in the coming quarters. We also continue to make necessary and disciplined infrastructure investments to ensure we have the foundations for category beating profitable growth for the long-term. The pressure from the investments will abate later this year as we'll talk more about that in a few minutes. Operationally, we made good progress on our initiatives to strengthen our Infinity flywheel that supports our differentiated business model. Mary will discuss in detail the progress on specific growth strategies but let me provide a brief update. On the product innovation front, as previously discussed, we formally launched Angled Side in the quarter. Angled Side offers benefits to augment both aesthetics and comfort, importantly, addressing the number one style gap we identified in our research. By opening the aperture of potential customers we're reaching, more new and existing customers and seeing meaningful contribution every week since the launch of the Angled Side. We continue to wisely expand our physical footprint supporting awareness and benefiting our e-commerce sales, altogether, delivering a seamless omni-channel experience to our customer. We're driving marketing efficiency with new tactics, including hyperlocal marketing to drive traffic. Lastly, we are still carefully investing in technology and R&D to fuel continued innovation to further elevate the entire customer experience and to ensure that we have a strong foundation to support the long runway of growth ahead. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect the macro environment to remain challenging, continuing to pressure the home category. We are not planning for any meaningful recovery in category growth this fiscal year. In terms of the promotional environment, we expect it will be more competitive as we head into holiday season and anticipate more frequency and depth of discounting across the industry. We've adapted our own plans accordingly, and we'll remain very agile through the holiday season. Even taking this into account, which doesn't change our confidence that Lovesac will continue to outperform the category and yes, generate stronger growth in the second half than the first half. This is clear in our guidance where we estimate third quarter revenues of approximate $154 million and are tightening the range of our fiscal 2024 net sales guidance to $710 million to $730 million nationally.  Given the macro back drop we are highly caused operationally we are focused on efficiency and will control expenses very tightly. This will become more clear, as we lap necessary foundational investments that began in the second half of fiscal 2023, and which put peak pressure on bottom line growth in second and third quarters this year. After adding in some discrete expenses, primarily professional fees related to the restatement of approximately $4 million, we now anticipate fiscal 2024 net income in the range of $20 million to $29 million. In summary, we have an unwavering commitment to the customer, delivering our unique design for life platforms through circular operations and an omni-channel experience. We're pleased with our performance thus far in fiscal 2024. Growing net sales and comping positively in a declining category, while funding essential investments in long-term growth and maintaining a very healthy balance sheet. We're committed to operating the business with great discipline as we navigate the current environment and build on our track record of market share gains, which will become more evident in the coming quarters. We're confident in the future. And we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver on our outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year and capitalize on any opportunities the macro backdrop offers. I want to extend my gratitude and appreciation to our Lovesac team. It is their execution that enables our best-in-category financial and operational performance and drives my confidence and excitement in our future. With that, I'll hand it over to Mary to cover our strategic priorities and progress in more detail. Mary?\nMary Fox: Thank you, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have extended our track record of industry leading growth for quarter two and also quarter three, as you can see from our preliminary results. Our second quarter net sales growth of 4% continues to be significantly ahead of the category, and more importantly, is up 221% on a four-year basis to give a comparison to pre-pandemic levels. And even with the planned SG&A deleverage that Shawn mentioned, adjusted EBITDA margin has increased over 1,000 basis points over the same four-year time period. It is our unique and compelling design for life platform and the virtually unparalleled value proposition it offers that enables us to continue to profitably take share even with current market dynamics. With a clear strategy for growth and crisp execution by a team that is coalesced around the priorities that support our growth strategy, we continue to drive operational excellence across the business and make progress as illustrated by the highlights I will now share with you. Firstly, starting with product innovation. As previously announced, our highly anticipated new product introduction, the Angled Side first launched in May in conjunction with our 25th anniversary brand campaign. Our customers have been very receptive. As we have discussed before, Star was the number 1 reason, customers left our purchase funnel and the Angled Side addressed our biggest opportunity around disparity to purchase. But the benefit is not only aesthetic, we also received strong feedback on enhance, comfort from existing and new customers. During third quarter, we expanded distribution and the Angled Side has now been available across our showroom base as well as our e-com platform since the end of July. A full media campaign launched during the summer is support and helped drive Angled Side as a percentage of total size sold to over 40% in recent periods. We believe we will continue to gain market share through this new product introduction as awareness and appreciation continues to grow. Secondly, our omnichannel experience. We continue to execute as a true omnichannel retailer through a combination of our physical touch points and digital platform. During second quarter, we opened 18 showrooms and three Best Buy shop-in shops. Our success in driving strong efficiencies in the time from construction to opening enabled us to pull-forward some openings with 15 of the 18 showrooms opening ahead of our original schedule. With regards to our Costco partnership, sales were up 15% in Q2, driven by increased pop-up shop presence versus last year. Our e-commerce channel performance continued to impress, up 12.8% for last year including costco.com and bestbuy.com and contributing meaningfully to our category outperformance. Underlying all channels and proof that our plan is working, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve and increase sequentially, driven by surgical initiatives in enhancing the digital experience and customer service improvements with technology investments in our customer loved teams. Thirdly, our brand ecosystem. Our efficient marketing, including our strong customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio lies at the center of our ecosystem and serves as an effective driver of fans awareness and customer acquisition. The back end, we are being very selective about marketing where the traffic is and where the eye bills are, as we continue to widen our customer aperture with both product innovation and marketing strategy and tactics. We continue to deploy new marketing tactics, including continuing to invest in high ROI performing programs and growing hyper local marketing to drive relevant traffic to our touch points. We remain focused on customer acquisition and have been utilizing vehicles such as direct mail campaigns that deliver strong ROIs for us. As previously mentioned, we've also begun leveraging prime and linear TV buys to continue to drive reach and strengthen our brand love. The objective of our launch of Angled Side was to broaden our aesthetic appeal to address the segment of the market that we were missing with our current assortment. So we partnered with Architectural Digest, a leader in style to launch the product. The launch partnership included content and advertisement on architecturaldigest.com and their partners as well as the launch event in New York City with designers and influencers, which generated additional content driving awareness of the launch. To-date, we are over 750 million impressions from this launch partnership and really pleased with not only the reach, but also the quality of the coverage. Regarding our circular operations initiative, we have made good progress on our open-box inventory as we focus on improving the executional effectiveness and brand experience. And we are seeing over 20% improvement in returns back to start versus last year as one key measure for this initiative. And then lastly, disciplined infrastructure investments and efficiency. For fiscal 2024, we are investing in the areas of technology and research and development to best fuel our Infinity Flywheel. We are focused on continuing to enhance customer satisfaction through continued delivery of orders in just days. In addition, we believe our recent investments in supply chain will help drive inventory product improvements of 20%. We're pleased with the team's progress so far and are on track to deliver this by year-end. As we've said before, we expect these initiatives will drive a significant improvement in efficiency of working capital as well as associated cost reductions across inbound freight and warehousing, which we started realizing in quarter three and will continue to realize in quarter four. Our AI pilots that we mentioned last quarter provides generative AI-guided experiences to our customer-facing service associates to improve customer service and we're pleased with initial results. So it is still very early. We continue to believe this has the potential to enhance the overall customer shopping experience and we are already seeing the benefits in the specific customer service satisfaction for improvement. As part of our people infrastructure investments, we recently appointed Carly Kawaja as our new Chief People Officer, as we continue to build our capabilities and evolve the organization strategically so that we can effectively scale the business. Through leveraging our extensive human resources experience we will be very strategic, building our organization through an optimal balance of human resources and impactful and efficient technology capabilities. Make no mistake, we are laser focused on operational excellence as we manage our cost structure and capital allocation. As Shawn mentioned, this will become more evident in coming quarters as deleverage abate. In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance and are ready to deliver the all-important fourth quarter. We're very proud of our team and their continued execution against our strategic initiatives, which in turn further strengthens our competitive positioning and powers our Infinity flywheel. I will now pass the call over to Keith to review our quarter two results and our outlook for quarter three and the balance of the year. Keith?\nKeith Siegner: Thank you, Mary. Before I get started, I want to express how excited I am to be here today as part of this amazing team that this remarkable brand, this truly differentiated business model. After having spent 16 years covering consumer companies on Wall Street, then being part of the leadership and a large-cap consumer company and the start-up, I can say the outlook for profitable growth at Lovesac is truly special. Between continued growth and market share gains for Sactionals and Saks, introduction of new products and categories and eventual geographic expansion, the opportunity is immense. All right. On to a quick review of second quarter, followed by our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2024. Net sales increased $6 million or 4% and to $154.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with the year-over-year increase driven by web and showrooms. This was in line with what we projected for the quarter driven by our July 4th promotional campaign and 25th anniversary celebration. Showroom net sales increased $5.8 million or 6.3% to $98.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $92.4 million in the prior year period. The increase in Showroom sales was driven by an increase of 2.7% in comparable Showroom sales related to higher point-of-sale transactions with lower promotional discounting than the prior year, and the net addition of 49 net new showrooms compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, point-of-sale transactions that we reflect in our comparable sales metrics, represent orders placed through our showrooms, which does not always reflect the point at which control transfers to the customer and when net sales are recorded. Internet net sales increased $5.9 million or 16.6% to $41.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $35.5 million in the prior year period. Other net sales, which include pop-up shop, shop-in-shop and open-box inventory transactions decreased $5.7 million or 27.7% to $14.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was principally due to a lower open-box inventory transactions, only $2.8 million compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our open-box inventory transactions with ICON are a part of our circular operations, design for life and ESG initiatives. We're making great progress in reviewing all options for this returned product to align with our sustainability goals, and which should retain more profits for Lovesac at the same time. We expect some of these initiatives to ramp in Q4. In the meantime, we may engage in limited open-box inventory transactions with ICON to ensure our warehouses are operating as efficiently as possible. In fact, in the third quarter, we will have an incremental $2.5 million in open box sales, which are included in our outlook. By product category, in the second quarter, our Sactional net sales increased 3%. SaaS net sales increased 18% and our other net sales, which includes decorative pillows, blankets and accessories increased 12% over the prior year. Gross margin increased 650 basis points to 59.8% of net sales in the second quarter versus 53.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a decrease of 720 basis points in total distribution and related tariff expenses. This was offset partially by 70 basis points of pressure from higher promotional discounting. The decrease in total distribution and related tariff expenses over the prior year is principally related to the positive impact of 880 basis points decrease in inbound transportation costs, partially offset by 160 basis points in higher outbound, transportation and warehousing costs. As a reminder, the benefits of the decrease in inbound freight rates will continue in the third quarter albeit at a slightly lower level. SG&A expense as a percent of net sales increased by 840 basis points, primarily due to deleverage within employment costs, selling-related expenses tied to the Lovesac credit card and continued investments to support current and future growth as well as professional fees. In dollars, employment costs increased by $5.7 million, primarily driven by an increase in new hires in fiscal 2023. Overhead expenses increased $6.2 million, consisting mainly of increases of $3 million in professional fees and $3.2 million in infrastructure investments in other miscellaneous items. Rent increased by $0.9 million related to $1.9 million rent expense from our net addition of 49 showrooms, partially offset by $1 million reduction in percentage rent. We estimate non-recurring incremental fees associated with the restatement of prior period financials was approximately $1.7 million in the second quarter. Advertising and marketing expenses increased $7.4 million or 39% to $26.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $19.1 million in the prior year period. Advertising and marketing expenses were 17.2% of net sales in the second quarter as compared to 12.9% of net sales in the prior year period. The primary contributor to the increased percentage was the launch of the 25th anniversary campaign. This will serve as the foundation for many of our marketing messages through the remainder of the fiscal year. Operating loss for the quarter was $1 million compared to operating income of $8.1 million in the second quarter of last year, driven by the factors we just discussed. Before we turn our attention to net loss, net loss per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA, please refer to the terminology and reconciliation between each of our adjusted metrics and their most directly comparable GAAP measurements in our earnings release issued earlier this morning. Net loss for the quarter was $0.6 million or negative $0.04 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.8 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the prior year period. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of $7,000 as compared to a $2.3 million tax provision for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The change in provision is primarily driven by the net loss for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was an income of $5.3 million as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $12.3 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was ahead of our expectations, principally driven by the upside to gross margin. Turning to our balance sheet. Our total merchandise inventory levels are in line with our projections, and have leveled out, as we discussed on our prior call. This is despite the addition of Angled Side SKUs, and we believe this is a clear highlight of the uniqueness of our business model. We feel exceptionally good about both the quality and quantity of our inventory and our ability to maintain industry-leading in-stock positions and delivery times. We ended the second quarter with a very healthy balance sheet, inclusive of $54.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as $36 million in availability on our revolving line of credit with no borrowings. Please refer to our earnings press release for other details on our second quarter financial performance. So now our outlook, and let's start with the fiscal third quarter. We estimate net sales of $154 million. This includes approximately $2.5 million of open-box inventory sales compared to $4.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect adjusted EBITDA between positive $0.5 million and negative $1.5 million. This includes gross margins between 56% and 57%. Merchandising and advertising slightly above 14 as a percent of net sales and SG&A slightly above 44% as a percent of net sales. We estimate net loss to be $3.2 million to $5.2 million. This includes approximately $1 million of non-recurring incremental expenses associated with our restatement of prior period financial statements. We estimate diluted loss per common share is expected to be $0.20 to $0.33 with 15.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. Now, for the full year fiscal 2024. We are tightening the range of our full year outlook for net sales to $710 million to $730 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA between $51 million and $63 million. This includes gross margins of $57 million to $57.5 million merchandising and advertising of slightly above 13% as a percent of net sales and SG&A between 37% and 38% as a percentage of net sales. We estimate net income to be between $20 million and $29 million. These fiscal 2024 estimates include approximately $4 million of non-recurring incremental expenses associated with our restatement of prior period financial statements. We estimate diluted income per common share in the range of $1.21 to $1.75, and approximately 16.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, the 53rd week in the fourth quarter is expected to contribute approximately $6 million in net sales. Quickly on our cash balance outlook. Given the timing of new touch point openings and our planned flow of inbound inventory ahead of the seasonally strong fourth quarter, the third quarter tends to be our lowest quarter ending cash balance of the year. I'm pleased to share that we ended fiscal third quarter with approximately $37 million in cash, which is up substantially from $3.8 million at the end of third quarter fiscal 2023. As we monetize inventory through the busy season, we continue to estimate we will end fiscal 2024 with a higher net cash balance than we ended fiscal 2023. So in conclusion, we are pleased with our second quarter results. Market share gains, strengthening foundations, exciting new growth drivers and a healthy balance sheet, put Lovesac in an enviable position. I'm new here, but I'm already very proud of the team's execution and what continues to be a challenging macro backdrop as well as their exuberance for optimizing the opportunity ahead of us. With a strong focus on growth, underpinned by an ROI-based approach to measured reinvestment I'm confident in the outlook. I'll now turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nThomas Forte: Great. So congrats on the performance and welcome, Keith. I have one high-level question. I wanted to give you an opportunity to address the question, I guess, from investors a lot. You have a great business with a high gross margin, yet historically you have not generated a lot of free cash flow. What have been the limiting factors in the past for this? How might this change in the future? And when you get to a point where you're generating significant free cash flow, how do you intend to use it including reinvesting in the business, buybacks and strategic M&A? Thanks.\nShawn Nelson: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Tom. I appreciate where it's coming from. This is Shawn. Lovesac has been on a rapid growth curve for about a decade now. I think when we look at our CAGR going back many, many years, it's extremely high. Leading into the pandemic -- heading into the pandemic brought an unprecedented growth and we've just been focused on chasing that, chasing market share and building the business in the most profitable way that we know how. Now that we've achieved the scale that we're at today, I believe that even in real time, the evidence of free cash flow growing and producing the kind of results that you're -- I think investors would hope for and expect out of a business that's the cheapest kind of scale will be evident, and we're really excited about that. Obviously, here, we're reporting on Q2, which is a strong path, because of the restatement process. But we've given a flash on Q3. And while we haven't spoken specifically about cash, we feel really encouraged about those results and believe that the evidence of this business' ability to generate free cash flow will be obvious. And so looking forward to sharing more on that, I'll kick it to Keith who can probably give a little more insight.\nKeith Siegner: Thanks, Shawn. So this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart. And I think listening to each of the three of us, both Shawn, Mary and myself, I think you would have heard a very clear commitment to a disciplined approach to reinvestment both in the organization and in future growth drivers. But just to put a couple of numbers around this in terms of proof in the pudding, you could say, look, SG&A deleverage, as an example, was a little over 840 basis points in the second quarter. When you build into your model, the G&A ranges that I gave you for the third quarter for the full year. What you'll see is that deleverage in SG&A in Q3, let's call it approximately half of what we had in 2Q and then when you see what falls out for fourth quarter, it's a substantial reduction even from there. So this isn't a fiscal 2025 only commitment. You're going to start to see this flow through in the next couple of quarters.\nThomas Forte: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Maria Ripps with Cannacord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nMaria Ripps : Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to ask about your outlook for Q4, which implies a pretty wide range for revenue growth for your biggest quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what's implied in your assumptions, both at the lower and the upper end of your guidance? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nKeith Siegner: Sure, thing. So I'll start with a couple of numbers around this, and then if Shawn or Mary want to add in some high level. It's basically a $20 million range on a big quarter given the macro backdrop that remains a little uncertain as you're hearing from pretty much everybody in the consumer category, particularly in our -- including in our close-in categories.  The way we're thinking about approaching that range is to plan prudently and allocate expenses prudently. We have a really unique business model that lets us react to upside surprises and demand much more quickly than others given that we're not merchandising led and can fulfill orders in retail inventory really quickly. So we think it's a better approach. We're going to know a lot more when we speak in a month post the all-important Black Friday holiday. But I think what we're trying to do is to show you we're going to manage this more prudently. The moving pieces really for us right now are, in general, macro conditions and macro demand within the category, number one. Number two, is the promotional environment. And you heard both Shawn and Mary talk about this before, how promotional is the category. We are approaching this from the perspective of slightly more promotional than we have been in the recent quarters, but still less promotional than we were pre-pandemic and less promotional than the peers. It's working for us. We're taking market share. We're expanding gross margins. We think that's the right way to approach this. And hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color about that range for fourth quarter. I don't know, Shawn or Mary, if you want to add anything else. Shawn?\nShawn Nelson: Yes, I think it's an uncertain time in the economy. We're being very prudent, as Keith said, and we're really happy that we have a business that is so dynamic and it has taken so much market share and it's so competitive in our landscape. And we're waiting to see, like I think the rest of the world, how to all unfold on the consumer side. But from what we're seeing so far, this is the best guidance that we can give, both looking at kind of the upside of it and the downside of it. And we're being really thoughtful. We're trying to build a business here that's here for 50 years, We're trying to -- at least we're trying to build a business that is a legacy brand that has staying power. We're not interested in short-term outcomes only. At the same time, we've been focused on building a profitable business that's been able to straddle very, very high growth while generating profits and as you'll see free cash flow. So, looking forward to the fourth quarter and we'll hope for a little upside as well.\nMaria Ripps: Got it. Got it. That makes sense. And then secondly, sort of understanding that you're not providing guidance beyond Q4 and but just sort of how should investors think about key growth drivers next year, so maybe showroom expansion, shop-in-shop strategy, product roadmap. And then Keith, you sort of touched on this a little bit, but maybe talk about where across your P&L, you see the ability to be more efficient and maybe preserve margins if the environment continues to be challenging next year?\nKeith Siegner: Yes. Thank you for the question, and I'm going to ask everybody for a little bit of grief and patience, given that this is my first quarter in the last couple of months, we were a little bit distracted with the restatement, which did slow my integration into the business a little bit. We'll have a lot more to talk about with fiscal 2025 here with fiscal third quarter results in about a month. But the way we kind of think about this is the moving pieces for market share gains really remain the same. It is intelligent and measured point showroom and touchpoint expansion. And it's going to -- you're going to see it across all of the same avenues that we've been doing, right? So you're going to see more Best Buy shop-in shops. You're going to see more through our other partner channels. You're going to see more formal showrooms. You're going to see more volumes through the website as well. We have a phenomenal customer experience and our configurator that's working for us, and I think we'll continue to pay dividends. So, all of that is going to remain the same. We'll have new product introductions that come throughout the year that are going to continue to drive interest in and love from our customers that will benefit the sales. When we move into cost, like we've said, ad nauseam throughout this call, we are going to be disciplined. It's not just on the SG&A side of things. It's also on the marketing side of things. We are seeing a lot of benefits from the 25th anniversary marketing campaign that we’ve discussed, but we won't have that same level of intensity as we move into next year from a percentage perspective. So I think what you'll hear from us is more of the same, which is working, right? It is growth, profitable growth, market share and better conversion to the bottom line in cash flows than we've seen in the past. So more to come on that, but it really is more of the same.\nMaria Ripps: Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.\nAlex Fuhrman: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Good to talk to you. Since we've last heard from you guys in June, a lot of other retailers are talking about weak demand for big ticket items, furniture, in particular. It looks like, obviously, you guys are keeping revenue guidance for this year intact at the midpoint. But are you seeing your customers acting any differently over the past few quarters, maybe opting for cheaper covers or fewer pieces? And just from a high level, how do you plan to market the customers this holiday season, who might be a little bit more cautious with their spending than they were last year during the holidays?\nMary Fox: Yes. Hey, Alex, it's Mary. Thank you so much for your question. So I think your point, as you think about the health of the consumer and the category, I think we're not planning or seeing any material change in the category. It will remain challenging. We'll continue to outperform the category take market share. And if you just think about even our outlook in -- that we shared for quarter three, double-digit growth on top of, obviously, very strong growth last year with a category that's declining double-digits. We're seeing a little bit around the -- obviously, Keith mentioned about promotions a little bit stronger in the category, we're seeing, for example, a little bit more around frequency, but we have baked that into our plans, and we feel really good as we look out for the rest of the holiday. We've been asked before in terms of any trends around trade down. In fact, actually, we're seeing it to be relatively flat or slightly elevated around premium mix upgrades. If you think about Lovesac, think about storage seats, still continue to be a little bit around financing trends versus last year, and we expect that to continue, which again, we have baked in -- so I think for us, it's very much similar to what Keith was saying for next year. We'll see it kind of continuing. We hope for more upside as things start to recover. And we've been the category leader for profitable growth. We talk about this every quarter before COVID, through COVID, through even this year. So whether there's headwinds or tailwinds for the category and the economy, we just continue to perform and driving that market share gain all based on the Infinity flywheel that we've talked about. So we'll be agile. We'll continue to adjust, as Shawn talked about, we're being very thoughtful in terms of prudently managing expenses, but we will drive in every way to gain that profitable market share.\nAlex Fuhrman: Great. That’s really helpful. Thank you very much, guys.\nMary Fox: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.\nMatt Koranda: Good morning. Just a couple for me. So I wondered, if you could maybe Mary speak to the Angled Side traction that you've had in recent months since the launch and then Stealth Tech attach rates. Just curious what it looks like in this environment, just given consumers' overall pressured, if you're seeing that change in any material way?\nMary Fox : Yeah. Great. Nice to hear from you, Matt. So yeah, Angled Side, as you know, Super excited with the launch. You heard me talk about that a little bit earlier, seeing very meaningful contribution, and our customers and teams love it. We shared before Star was the number one reason that customers were leaving the purchase funnel. This was the number one silhouette that was ranked for sale and launched the date, we're really feeling good in terms of that great innovation. And I think it's not just in terms of the styles poise. What's been really great is hearing from customers about the comfort level as you sit in the Angled Side Couch. So, just that extra aesthetic choice now, but also the comfort, and we're seeing that with current and new customers. So we're seeing high adoption already, which I shared just over 40%. So I feel really good in terms of the silhouette and just really reflecting our ability to widen the aperture, gain new consumers and even the architectural digest campaign, and they are known as being the number one style leader and furniture was just a tremendous way for us to be able to widen that visibility. Then in terms of Deltek, thank you for that question as well. Customers continue to love it, Matt, and I think you made a note of it in one of your reports being in some of the showrooms I was out in showrooms, even on Wednesday. They love the product experience, and they love the fact it's backwards compatible, which we see as a very unique proposition in the market compared to others. That -- kind of want you to buy something and then a year, two years later, they've come up with a new model, and you have to buy that new model. So as we continue to drive the strong combination of technology, and really that opportunity in that wide space that we will own and drive for many years to come we're feeling really good. So yes, Deltek, certainly for the holidays, we feel really good. So thank you for the questions.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Great, Mary. Thank you for that. And then on gross margins, just curious, I know you mentioned a more promotional environment. Obviously, we're seeing that show up everywhere. But how much of a headwind are you guys factoring in on gross margins from promotions in the second half? I wonder if maybe, Keith could speak to that. And then just in terms of financing, any discernible change in the way that your customers attached to the financing offering that you have? And have those -- I assume those costs have gone up for you guys, but just maybe speak to access to financing among your consumer set.\nKeith Siegner: Sure, thanks. And I'm going to do it in reverse order. I'm going to start with the financing piece. So look, it really is a differentiator for us to have this product, the Lovesac credit card we work really closely with our partner on this. And it's definitely an important part of the proposition for us. So from a percentage or contribution to demand perspective, it's up a decent amount year-over-year. In fact, it's up to over a-third of the dollars of demand in the fiscal second quarter, over 500 basis points increase in percentage. The piece that is also impacting our financials right now is the increase in costs, given the higher rates. So we think we still have a very competitive cost with our partner, but it is up year-over-year. That is one of the primary drivers of the year-over-year growth and the deleverage that we're seeing within SG&A. And you heard us outline those -- you heard me outline that earlier. But what we're doing in response to that is we're testing what really makes the difference, right? What is the customer value and what drives behavior with The Lovesac credit card, is it the duration given that we've seen other people shortening duration of their offers? Where do we get the best customer impact for the best cost for us? And so we've been running a bunch of tests in different markets to optimize that. We feel like we're in a pretty healthy spot, particularly here as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. So generally speaking, I think it is working, it's accomplishing exactly what we wanted to, and we continue to fine-tune and optimize that balance between driving sales at optimal cost for us. On the other side of the equation, on the discount side, we are playing around with the discounts, as you heard us mention, we do anticipate those discounts to pick up a little bit as we get into -- well, third quarter was slightly higher than it was in the second quarter, and we expect slightly higher in the fourth quarter than in third quarter. We're talking in 100 basis points here, 100 basis points there. These aren't big numbers or big changes in terms of what it's going to do to our net sales off of MSRP. Again, we've done a lot of A/B testing and let the data drive this. So when you see the gross margins that I provided earlier, you could back into fourth quarter pretty easily, right, because Q3 is virtually done. It's a negligible impact on the overall P&L at the -- from MSRP to net sales. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color.\nMatt Koranda: Yeah, absolutely. Very helpful, Keith. Thank you. And then just last one, if I could sneak one more in. On the showroom growth plans heading into 2025, obviously, you're not asking for guidance here, but I'm assuming those plans need to be pretty well baked at this point in the year, just given the lease timing and everything like that. Just wondering how nimble do you feel like you can be on showroom openings heading into next year if the environment changes for the better or for the worse? Just curious how to think about nimbleness there and plans for next year roughly?\nMary Fox: Yeah. Hi, Matt, yeah, thank you for the question. We continue to look at our real estate strategy all the time. And I think one of the success factors we've always had is around that nimbleness, picking up amazing locations or even slowing down openings. So it will be similar to this year is where we're thinking. But obviously, we'll share more as the year finalizes, because we're still working on some of the leases for next year. I think what's super important as we think about productivity of the showroom if I think about just this year in the new fleet for this year, they're performing above last year. You know, our numbers are super strong in terms of payback in just under a year. So it's a very strong model that we have, and that's the growth on the year before. And we're planning for that to continue to grow for next year. So I think we, unlike many others, we have very small showrooms that are mighty, they drive incredible revenue off a very small space and really also help us with what we see as our superpower, which is that demo and really being able to showcase why Lovesac is just so different to anyone else because it is designed for life and gives you that flexibility. So again, we'll share more at the end of the year, but you can expect very similar to where we have been, and we will continue to obviously watch the macros.\nKeith Siegner: Just two quick numbers for you as well. We had -- we're projecting or we had, I should say, nine showroom openings in the third quarter. We've got two in the first period of Q4. We did have one closure in Q3. Most of these are the closures are relocated. So it's funny for me having come from where it was in consumer in the past where it feels like 90% of all the opens happened in the last month of the year. We're actually well ahead of it here. And the same thing goes for next year, stay ahead of it, be thoughtful, be objective in measuring. The fact that we are omni-channel, and we use them as much as awareness drivers really creates a very exciting opportunity for me as well. So disciplined approach to 25%, as Mary said -- and those are some extra numbers for the rest of this year as well.\nShawn Nelson: Yes. I'll tag on to this if that's okay as well. Lovesac showrooms are just a different animal in retail. They really are, and we feel really lucky to have evolved this way and to have, frankly, achieved this scale at this time. I think it's obvious to anyone watching that we've lived through some really unprecedented economic times. And over the last few years, it's been an extremely noisy consumer marketplace. There's plenty of Lovesac sort of copycats out there trying to do something like what we do, mostly online. And in the end when you see those products in person compared to what we're offering, that is just not even close in terms of quality and execution, that sort of thing. But you need to see it in person to really appreciate it because in a photograph, it can look very similar. And so to be -- let's call it, 200 locations ahead of pretty much everyone in that realm. And at a time when investment is more dear, cash is more precious, we will be very cognizant of building cash and building earnings as well, I think most I really think that puts us in a really strong position over the next couple of years, as our business model continues to gain strength. Look at the growth we're putting up compared to the categories. It's just -- the category is down significantly right now. I'm talking really a biz mall falling off going on. I'm being really transparent. Lovesac is growing, and we will continue to grow. And we feel very confident in that. And a big piece of that is that we've got the best product in the marketplace, delivered in the most efficient way. And meanwhile, we don't have big eyes to just put up locations. I've said for a long time, our overall point of view is to have a few showrooms we can get away with. But we need to make the product available to people who are spending $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000 of whack with us. And would love to see this thing one time, because even though they know they can return the product in our return window or whatever. And we're always -- we're just so customer-focused. We always take it back. We'll always work with people and our return rate is relatively low, but who wants to deal with that, right? Consumers aren't stupid. And so these showrooms are super power and the fact they can operate in like 800 square feet with a total staff of five, six people, let alone usually one or two maybe at any given moment in the showroom, there is nothing comparable to what we're doing. There is no analog for that. They are radically efficient, they're radically effective, and we're really proud of the business model that we have evolved into over these many years. And I think at this particular time, it's especially poignant because we have reached that escape velocity where others have not. And then meanwhile, the traditional players are just a completely different operating model. Those that we -- and I don't disrespect them. There are amazing furniture brands out there doing beautiful things but we're not operating on beauty. Our product is beautiful, and we make -- we have great designs and only getting more refined with introductions like Angled Side, et cetera, there's more to come, lots more to come. But we're playing a different game, and it's working really well for us. And I think that all of these strengths are the reason you're seeing this disparity between us and the category, and you will continue to see it. And so we're very proud of that.\nMatt Koranda: Super detail and helpful guys. Appreciate it all. Best of luck for holiday.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would now hand the conference over to Shawn Nelson, for closing comments.\nShawn Nelson: I just want to say thank you to all of our investors and partners and all those in the finance community who continue to support our business. And especially thanks to our extended #LovesacFamily and the teams that continue to drive our results. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference of Lovesac has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Lovesac's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Rachel Schacter of ICR. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nRachel Schacter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. With me on the call is Shawn Nelson, Chief Executive Officer; Mary Fox, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Donna Dellomo, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some of the information discussed will include forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future financial performance. These include statements about our future expectations, financial projections, and our plans and prospects. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the company's filings with the SEC, which includes today's press release. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions and beliefs as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them, except as required by applicable law. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from our GAAP results. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to such non-GAAP financial measure has been provided as supplemental financial information in our press release. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Shawn Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of The Lovesac Company.\nShawn Nelson: Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, I will start by reviewing the highlights of our first quarter fiscal 2024 performance and then briefly provide an update on our operational accomplishments and outlook. Then Mary Fox, our President and COO, will update you on the progress we made against our strategic initiatives this quarter. And finally, Donna Dellomo, our CFO, will review our financial results and a few other items related to our outlook in more detail. We are pleased with our first quarter results that beat expectations even amidst a challenging macro backdrop and against our toughest comparison of the year in the first quarter. Elevated inflation and higher interest rates continued to drive a more cautious consumer pressuring the home category overall. We are not immune from these headwinds, but as evidenced by our consistent and reliable results, we have significant advantages versus the broader category, which I will expound upon in a moment. We are confident that our unique business model and product designs allow us to continue to outperform the category, which was down 20% in the first quarter, as reported by our data sources in contrast to our sales growth and positive comps. Now, let me review the highlights of our first quarter performance. Total sales were 141.2 million, up 9.1% versus the prior year period. We delivered total comparable sales of 15.1%, which was better than expected, driven by the timing of our marketing campaigns, even as we lapped a very strong Q1 comp last year of 42%. Given the plan for gross margin pressure this quarter and some SG&A deleverage as we've continued to prudently invest in the business to support long-term prospects. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of 2.4 million for the quarter, which Mary and Donna will discuss along with our financial performance in more detail. We made good progress on our operational initiatives this quarter, meant to strengthen our Infinity Flywheel. The uniqueness of our top quality products and overall concept continues to drive strong word of mouth benefits with customers becoming our most fervent advocates continually propelling this flywheel. This is especially beneficial in a macro environment such as this one. Mary will discuss in detail the progress on specific growth strategies. But by far the key Q1 accomplishment was the in showroom launch of our new Angled Side roughly two months ahead of our internal schedule. This is the new product launch that we teased last quarter. The Angled Side for sactionals seems innocuous enough, but our concerted research efforts show us that this particular addition to the Sactionals family can drive significant upside for sactionals amongst new and existing customers. We believe based on the numbers, Sactionals is already the number one best-selling couch design in America right now. But new introductions like this one layered onto our proprietary platform only widen our moat. And there are many more to come. Style is obviously a critical component when it comes to winning in home decor. Sactionals are far and away the most functional design in the marketplace as we continue to innovate on more functional add-ons to come. There are aesthetic ways for the platform to evolve as well, like this one, they can offer customers in the consideration phase greater choice and control. Initial sales rates confirmed this hypothesis and we look forward to seeing the entire Sactionals platform of products continue to take market share and grow, even as business in the overall macro category is shrinking at the moment. We expect to see continued growth in what is a gigantic $41 billion upholstery category, of which even with our market share gains, we still have only captured very low single-digit penetration. As with all Designed For Life product platform expansions, the Angled Side can be added to any Sactionals collection ever sold and is available from the outset with StealthTech sound plus charge as an option. Our Designed For Life way of managing product platforms is revolutionary in product design and branding. The result is not only true sustainability products that can actually sustain, but a satisfying brand experience. This builds extreme levels of trust between our brand and our customers, and that is the point. We are building a brand that people love. This is the unlock for sustained future value to our shareholders. We will continue to invent and innovate in this unique way forever, both on existing Sacs, Sactionals and StealthTech platforms and in other categories yet to be announced where home meets tech. Looking at the remainder of the year, we expect the macro environment to remain challenging, pressuring the home category. We also expect our trajectory of relative outperformance versus the category to continue. Given this backdrop, we remain highly cautious operationally as we continue to control expenses very tightly, making investments very prudently. Our strong debt rebalance sheet continues to position us well to navigate in this environment. While we are pleased with our Q1 outperformance, we are reiterating our full year outlook at this time with some sharpening for Q2, which Donna will discuss. The Memorial Day timeframe was strong for us beating last year. Remember, our net sales figures align closely with real time sales demand. We have virtually no realized revenue from backlog as we typically ship directly to the customer just days from when their order is placed. We remain in stock of all key items because of the advantages of our platform based approach and the skew efficiencies afforded us by our evergreen inventory. We continue to put up the strongest demand numbers in the category that we are aware of. The competitive landscape is highly promotional at the moment, but we have been holding the line on promotions in general. While higher than the abnormally low levels exhibited last year, we are still not back to pre-pandemic promotional levels and our ability to continue these share gains with promotional intensity that is well below the competition speaks to the real demand for our products. We are not just selling generic furniture to people when they're looking for furniture in the marketplace. On that note, it is important for investors to understand one key reason why Lovesac demand remains so strong versus the competition and why management remains confident, at least cautiously optimistic in this environment. We sell value products. This is widely misinterpreted because of our products, high sticker price. Our Sacs, which look like giant bean bags, sell for more than $1,000 on average. Sactionals, which are the majority of our sales, are priced at the high end for upholstery to be sure. The typical first sactionals purchase averages around $5,000, and it is not at all uncommon to see transactions in the $10, 000, $15,000 and even $20,000 range on a daily basis, especially since the introduction of StealthTech. But this customer is a value customer. They are choosing to spend quite a bit of money with us because of all the value we design into the product and platform. These are adaptable, upgradable, changeable and washable products. They are uniquely durable, built to last a lifetime, and designed to evolve with our customers throughout their life. Our fundamental quality and commensurate lifetime guarantee cannot be beat by any competitor. Furthermore, we are a couch specialist and the strongest one in the marketplace at that. We have significant scale now. We estimate that our Sactionals business alone to be larger than many of our furniture generalist competitors, entire upholstery businesses across all of their disparate upholstery SKUs. Unlike furniture generalists, however, the couch category operates on slightly different dynamics than the home decor market broadly. The number one driver of couch replacement behavior is old or worn out couches, not new home sales, relocation or even remodels. Even in a recession, couches wear out. This doesn't make us recession-proof, but it is still a much better dynamic than being in the furniture business as a generalist at times like these. Not to mention the inventory implications alone. These advantage Lovesac. On top of that, we maintain constant contact with our customer base because every single Lovesac customer made their purchase directly with us, never through a distributor. Our platform based approach to innovation allows us to introduce new add-ons with regularity from StealthTech to the brand new Angled Side to changeable covers and smaller accessories that we introduce regularly. This Designed For Life platform approach and outreach programs drive our repeat business to constitute roughly 40% of our transactions ongoing. We have chosen to blaze a trail in this category, utilizing this differentiated value proposition from all of our competitors paired with a proven, effective and efficient go-to market strategy, as evidenced by our many, many years of unrelenting growth and profitability. As we look to the long-term, we remain very confident in the future of the Lovesac brand for all of these reasons. We believe we have significant growth runway still ahead of us with a very robust pipeline of new products that we are designing to dominate the myriad home plus tech categories that we have yet to enter, but that we perceive as ripe for disruption. Before turning the call over to Mary, I'd like to thank the entire Lovesac team for their relentless efforts and execution of our strategies. This year is Lovesac's 25th anniversary. We will find ways to celebrate this milestone throughout the year to drive exposure and credibility. It is a significant milestone for us, not just because we've made it for this long, but because it really underscores our ability to stand behind our enduring products. It is reflective of the sustained-ability of our Designed for Life product platform. And it's not just about our long-term products. We are building a sustained-a [indiscernible] organization quarter by quarter, year by profitable year. A business that can actually sustain. We have done so now for a very long time with a near spotless track record as a listed company. Even as we've generated very high growth on an annual basis for many years now, stacked with profitability regardless of the landscape its ever evolving management team maintains the highest ambitions. Our ultimate goals are lofty. We are totally committed to our decade long vision and we are focused on making sharp decisions to continue to deliver sustained results, sustainable products, and a truly sustainable brand. It should be obvious, based on our track record, we intend to make it continue that way. To that end, I'd like to take a moment to address today's announcement of Donna's retirement and the appointment of our new CFO, Keith Siegner. I am thrilled to welcome Keith as our new CFO. With his proven track record in financial leadership, I look forward to the impact he will have in guiding our finance functions as we continue to scale the Lovesac business and brand. I also want to express how very grateful we are for Donna's contributions during her six years at Lovesac. She has been an amazing business partner throughout some of our most formative years. We have greatly benefited from her work ethic and professionalism in leading our finance organization. I particularly want to highlight her invaluable contributions in helping us navigate the recent pandemic years, as well as her leadership leading up to the 2018 IPO and subsequent transition to being a public company. We wish her all the best in her retirement. While this change is effective, on June 30th, Donna will be around for one year as a Senior Strategic Advisor to ensure a smooth transition. In addition, I would like to extend my sincere thank you to Jack for his seven years of service with the company, which includes his roles of President and Chief Operating Officer and more recently, Chief Strategy Officer. He has really been my business partner since joining Lovesac back in 2015. Jack has played an instrumental role in transforming the company into a true omnichannel retailer by helping expand our physical touchpoints and digital platform as we continue to disrupt the industry. We wish him nothing but the best in his retirement and look forward to his continuing his service on the board. Gratefully, Mary has already proven to be an invaluable partner to me for this new chapter at Lovesac. She is awesome. Mary and I are both grateful to continue to have Jack's wisdom and judgment available to us through his continued role on the board. With that, I will now hand it over to Mary to cover our strategic priorities and progress. Mary?\nMary Fox: Thank you, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results that beat expectations with industry leading growth against the difficult macro backdrop. As Shawn said, while the industry is seeing pressure, we continue to outperform as we execute against our strategic initiatives driven by our customer and product centric focus, differentiated omnichannel business model and unique Infinity Flywheel. Our net sales growth rate of 9.1% continues to be ahead of the category on a one year basis and is up 244.4% on a four year basis to give you a comparison to pre-pandemic levels, with an adjusted EBITDA margin increase of 980 basis points over the same four year time period. While we observed that customers are being more cautious with discretionary purchases and impacted by tightening credits in the first quarter, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of our brand metrics and market share gains fueled by our strong operational execution as evidenced in the KPIs we track closely. We also continue to see best-in-class paybacks across our touchpoints and relatively consistent performance across our geographical markets. We are uniquely positioned to continue to profitably take share even through the current market dynamics by continuing to make progress on our growth strategies and delivering great value through our Designed For Life platform at a time when this value matters to our customers more than ever. A few highlights on our go-forward plans for each of our strategic initiatives all centered on Infinity Flywheel. Firstly, starting with product innovation, where we had very notable progress in quarter one as Shawn discussed, our highly anticipated new product introduction, the Angled Side soft launched in May in conjunction with our 25th anniversary brand campaign. The Angled Side addresses our biggest opportunity around barriers to purchase for our consumer as style is the number one reason they leave our purchase funnel and Angled Side was the top scoring silhouette. This new introduction will enable us to continue to gain market share in this fragmented category. This product is currently only available in our showrooms, and we anticipate it will be available on our e-comm platform by the end of July with a full media campaign starting in August. Innovation is an inherent part of our DNA at Lovesac. So we are excited for this launch and many more launches to come over the coming years. After the first few weeks of launching our Angled Side in showrooms, we are seeing immediate traction in KPIs, including quotes and conversion as well as very positive feedback from customers on the design and how comfortable it is. Secondly, our omnichannel experience. We continue to execute as a true omnichannel retailer through a combination of our physical touch points and digital platform. During this quarter, we opened 16 showrooms and one Best Buy shop-in-shops. For the quarter, our e-commerce channel performance was very strong at 28.7% increase, well ahead of the category according to our estimates, by over 5,300 basis points and ahead of our expectations. This strong performance has been driven from the customer experience improvements we made last year, delivering an increase in conversion and AOV and then higher ROI from our digital programs versus last year. In terms of our Costco partnership, demand was up 5.6%, driven by physical road show point-of-sale transactions versus quarter one last year. Also importantly, as a result of our unique omnichannel experience, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve and sequentially increased in quarter one, especially for our digital experience and fulfillment stores. Thirdly, our ecosystem. This is centered around our efficient marketing, including our strong customer lifetime value and customer acquisition cost ratio with payback after the first purchase and word-of-mouth, which continues to drive brand awareness and an effective customer acquisition funnel. This year, we've begun deploying new marketing tactics that include continuing to invest in high ROI performing programs and growing hyper local marketing to drive relevant traffic to our touch points. We continue to drive new customer acquisition using vehicles such as direct mail campaigns. We've also begun leveraging prime and linear TV buys to continue to drive reach and to strengthen our brand LOVE. And as Shawn mentioned, our 25th anniversary celebrity campaign is very successful, generating over 3 billion impressions to date, with coverage from Rolling Stone, Billboard, People, New York Times and many more. We are also making good progress internally on our circle to consumer initiative on open-box inventory, which is focused on improving the executional effectiveness and the brand experience and we will be sharing more details later this year. And finally disciplined infrastructure investments. Despite the uncertain environment, we operate our business with a strong focus on growth and an ROI-driven investment discipline, and we believe it is important to prudently invest in the business for the near and long-term. This year, our investments for growth were both primarily in the areas of technology and research and development to continue fueling our flywheel. AI is an important area for our investment, and we have recently begun a pilot providing generative AI-guided experiences to our customer-facing service associates. So early in our results, we're seeing great promise in this initiative and the potential to enhance the overall customer experience. As previously mentioned, we expect this year to reinforce our customer satisfaction by continuing to deliver orders in just days, while also delivering inventory productivity improvements of 20% enabled by our recent investments and the teams are making good progress on this initiative. We expect this will have significant effects on the efficiency of working capital as well as associated cost reductions across inbound freight and warehousing, which we will start to see in the second half of this year. So in summary, we are pleased to have reported results ahead of expectations amidst a challenging environment. We are very proud of our team and their continued execution against our strategic initiatives, which enables the continued strengthening of our competitive positioning and powers our Infinity Flywheel. I also wanted to really thank Jack and Donna for their incredible partnership and I am very happy that we will continue to work together in their new capacities. And I'm also really looking forward to work with Keith. I will now pass the call over to Donna to review our quarter one results and our outlook for fiscal '24. Donna?\nDonna Dellomo: Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my remarks with a review of our first quarter results and then discuss our outlook for fiscal 2024. Net sales increased $11.8 million or 9.1% to $141.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, with the year-over-year increase driven by growth in all channels. This increase was stronger than what we had projected for the quarter, primarily driven by higher-than-planned Internet net sales due to strong promotional campaigns which pulled forward some internal projected demand from Q2 into Q1. Showroom net sales increased $2.3 million or 2.9% to $83.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $81.3 million in the prior year period. The increase in showroom net sales was driven by an increase of 8.4% in comparable showroom sales related to higher point-of-sale transactions with higher promotional discounting than the prior year and a net addition of 49 new showrooms compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, point-of-sale transactions that we reflect in our comparable sales metric represents orders placed through our showrooms which does not always reflect the point at which controls, transfers to the customer and when the net sales are recorded. Internet net sales increased $8.9 million or 28.7% to $40.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $31.3 million in the prior year period. Other net sales, which include pop-up shop, shop-in shop and open-box inventory transactions increased $500,000 or 3.1% to $17.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $16.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was largely driven by 95 in-store Costco pop-up shops that generated $4 million of net sales that we did not have in Q1 last year as we only reintroduced in-store pop-up shops with Costco in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as they had been put on hold due to COVID in March of 2020. This increase was also a result of a planned increase of approximately $1.4 million of open-box inventory transactions to $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 from $2.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. These increases were partially offset by lower productivity of our temporary online pop-up shops on costco.com. We opened one additional Best Buy shop-in-shop location compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, our open-box inventory transactions with ICON are part of our C2C DFL and ESG initiatives. We are making great progress in reviewing all options for this return product that align with our sustainability goals. We expect some of these initiatives to go live beginning in Q2 and into the second half of the fiscal year. In the meantime, we may have some open-box inventory transactions with ICON to ensure our warehouses are operating as efficiently as possible and we'll disclose any net sales on future calls in the event that they occur. By product category in the first quarter, our Sactionals net sales increased 11.2%. Sacs net sales decreased 10% and our other category net sales, which includes decorative pillows, blankets and other accessories, increased 4.2% over the prior year period. Gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 50.1% of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 from 51.1% of net sales in the prior year quarter primarily driven by a decrease of 120 basis points in product margin, driven by planned higher promotional discounting than the prior year, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 20 basis points in total distribution and related tariff expenses. The slight decrease in total distribution and related tariff expenses over the prior year is principally related to 170 basis points inbound transportation benefit from decreased container costs, partially offset by 150 basis points in higher outbound transportation and warehousing costs due to higher FedEx rate and the expansion of our warehouse network. As shared with you on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expected to see modest benefits related to the decrease in inbound freight rates in Q1 and the benefits to be most impactful in Q2 and Q3 of fiscal 2024. The 26.6% year-over-year increase in SG&A was primarily related to an increase in employment costs, overhead expenses, sales related expenses and rent. Employment costs increased by $5.9 million driven by an increase in new hires in fiscal 2023. Overhead expenses increased $2.9 million with the majority of this increase or $1.6 million related to computer expense investments in our new point-of-sale system to support current and future growth. Rent increased by $1.4 million, principally related to the rent for the additional 49 net showroom. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 560 basis points primarily due to planned deleverage within employment costs, selling-related expenses, rent and continued investments to support current and future growth. Advertising and marketing expenses increased $1 million or 6.4% to $16.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $15.9 million in the prior year period. Advertising and marketing expenses were 12% of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 12.3% of net sales in the prior year period. As a reminder, advertising and marketing investments benefit multiple fiscal periods. Depreciation and amortization increased $100,000 from the prior year to $2.8 million, principally related to capital investments for new and remodeled showrooms. Operating loss for the quarter was $5.9 million compared to operating income of $2.6 million in the first quarter of last year, driven by the factors just discussed. Net interest income was $300,000 for the first quarter as compared to an interest expense of less than $50,000 for the prior year period. Interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances was favorable from higher interest rates compared to the prior year period. Before we turn our attention to net loss income, net loss income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA, please refer to the terminology and reconciliation between each of our adjusted metrics and their most directly comparable GAAP measurements in our earnings release issued earlier today. Net loss for the quarter was $4.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.9 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the prior year period. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million as compared to a $700,000 tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The change in the provision is primarily driven by the net loss for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $2.4 million as compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was ahead of our expectations principally driven by higher net sales. Turning to our balance sheet. Our total merchandise inventory levels are in line with our projections and have leveled out as we had discussed on our prior call. Inventory decreased 13% year-over-year and we feel exceptionally good about both the quality and the quantity of our inventory and our ability to maintain industry-leading in-stock positions and delivery time. As we move through fiscal 2024, inventory levels will continue to moderate due to inbound freight relief and our technology investments, which enable us to allocate inventory more efficiently. We ended the first quarter with $45.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $36 million of availability on our revolving line of credit with no borrowing. We are pleased with our strong balance sheet and our cash position at the end of the first quarter. Please refer to our earnings press release for other details on our first quarter financial performance. Now moving to our outlook. As you saw in our press release, we are reiterating our full year outlook for net sales of $700 million to $740 million, approximately 30 net new showrooms, total comps in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, adjusted EBITDA margins in the 8% to 9% range and earnings per share in the $1.83 to $2.24 range with a share count of 16.4 million weighted average diluted shares. Given our strong results in Q1, factoring in our expected Q2 performance, our second half touch point expansion, the launch of our new innovation of Angled Side along with the accompanying media support, our 25th anniversary brand campaign and the additional 53rd week, we remain confident in our full year outlook. As a reminder, the 53rd week in the fourth quarter is expected to contribute approximately $6 million in net sales, $400,000 in adjusted EBITDA and $0.02 in EPS, which is reflected in our fiscal 2024 guidance. For the second quarter, we expect net sales of $149 million to $151 million being driven by the planned opening of approximately seven showrooms and a total comparable sales increase in the 3% to 5% range. The second quarter decrease in comp sales from Q1 is a result of a shift in demand relating to promotional activity between Q1 and Q2, such that the first half total comps overall are within the range of expectations embedded in our full year outlook. As we have discussed before, we are up against the toughest comps in the first half of the year. Our second quarter projections include open-box inventory transactions which will be significantly less than the $9.6 million from the second quarter of last year and not more than our Q1 fiscal '24 open-box inventory net sales. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1 million to $1.5 million, driven by an expected gross margin increase of 200 basis points, which will be more than offset by planned deleverage in marketing and advertising related to investments in test-and-learn initiatives, future innovation and events surrounding Lovesac's 25th anniversary brand building. In addition, the planned deleverage in SG&A, primarily in payroll, rent and credit card fees. Loss per share is expected to be $0.12 to $0.16 for the second quarter with 15.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. We are continuing to make important investments in the business to support current and future growth. These investments are critical to our ability to drive long-term growth and sustained market share gains. As I mentioned last quarter, with the second half of our year, traditionally being the strongest in net sales, the timing of our new touch point openings, new product launches, and our planned flow of inbound inventory, we expect to use cash during the second and third quarters of the year before generating substantial free cash flow in the fourth quarter to end fiscal 2024 with a significantly higher year-over-year cash balance. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which came in better than our expectations. We are proud of our team's execution in what continues to be a challenging macro backdrop. We will continue to operate our business with a strong focus on growth and ROI-driven investment discipline. Finally, as you saw announced earlier today, I've made the decision to retire as EVP and CFO of Lovesac effective June 30th. It has been a privilege to be part of the Lovesac team for over the last 6.5 years and witnessed first-hand the brand's expansion, while working alongside our leadership team and the many talented individuals throughout the company. With Lovesac well-positioned for success, I felt it was the right time to make this transition, and we view Keith as the ideal candidate for the role. I look forward to continuing to support Lovesac's success in my new role as Senior Strategic Adviser. Now I'll turn the call over to Shawn for a quick wrap up. Shawn?\nShawn Nelson: Before Q&A, I just want to take a moment again to thank our dedicated #Lovesac family and team who have proven their ability to beat expectations with consistency. We are proud of these continued category-leading results, particularly in the current macro landscape. These results along with what we've seen so far in Q2 give us the confidence to reiterate our full year guidance and continue to invest prudently in our initiatives to drive future growth even as we are surely taking significant market share in real-time based on these numbers. Thanks again to Donna and to Jack, who have both been key to our ability to drive such consistency over many years now, they have each given a piece of their life to building what we all believe can be an influential, valuable and much loved brand with decades of growth yet to come. We are grateful to them. They have given our newer members and leadership, a solid foundation to build on, and we are confident that we, once again, have a top-notch team in place to carry the momentum forward and take it even further. With that, we'll turn the call back to the operator to manage Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. First off, congratulations, Donna and Jack on your retirement. It's been a pleasure working with you.\nDonna Dellomo: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So my question -- my question, I guess, the first question, we talk about -- just the gross margins is you're maybe getting better line of sight now to some improving cost metrics. I mean, how should we think about the gross margins from here. There's been some stabilization, but you're still tracking meaningfully below what had been historic peaks.\nDonna Dellomo: Brian, specifically around the gross margin, are you looking to say where do we see the benefits?\nBrian Nagel: Yes. So just as we think about the trajectory from here, either through the balance of '23 to '24 and maybe kind of the puts and takes? Any update there?\nDonna Dellomo: Yes. So, first of all, thank you for acknowledging me earlier today. Just on the puts and takes of the gross margin, really, what we're going to see is some substantial benefits, as we said, 200 basis points increase on gross margin, which is substantially related to the benefits that we're seeing coming in through the lower freight cost split, which we paid for last year. We're just getting the benefit of it coming through the P&L this year. That benefit that we will see will fully come through in Q4 and we feel really confident in that. We have really good line of sight into that. Our container costs are actually still continuing to come down. But what we are still seeing there is some we'll call it, in land transportation costs that are related, what we call is demurrage, right, which is beyond our control. It's really getting the containers once they hit the ports here in the US to our facilities. So where you do hear while container costs are coming down to $3,000, $4,000, there is still some additional costs there related to the inbound transportation of those containers, but significantly less than a year ago when we were saying it's $25,000, we're probably paying all in even with the demurrage probably closer to five. So those costs will see the full benefit coming through of that on the fourth quarter. So barring anything else that comes our way with inbound container costs next year will be a clean year for us. But we do have some headwinds as those other companies on last mile, which is the FedExes of the world and the UPS, we predominantly use FedEx, but we are doing all that we can to mitigate that. Mary may share some additional initiatives that we're looking at with other carrier opportunities. We actually start with a really -- at a really good spot with our negotiations and our rates with FedEx and then on warehousing, the same thing with higher labor costs, we are seeing a little headwind in there. But that all being said, that is all accounted for in any of the guidance that we've provided plus a little extra to make sure that we cover things that we may not see coming our way.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And then my follow-up question with regard to sales. So I think, Donna, you mentioned in your comments, a pull forward from, I guess, from Q2 into Q1. Maybe just help size that and what that relates to specifically. And then within sales, we talked about some of the promotional activity, Shawn, you talked about promotion still tracking up from last year, but still below where they've been historically. As you think about the business and this backdrop, would you consider being acting more promotional, stepping up promotions more to really help, I guess, on the continued market share front?\nMary Fox: Good morning, Brian. It's Mary here. So just your first question in terms of the shift that Donna referenced, I think one of the great things that we're learning is that we don't necessarily always have to have promotions at key tentpole moments. The quote pipeline fills up very fast and we actually tested doing an off-cycle promotion to basically just drive a bit more conversion. So that was towards the end of April and our demand far exceeded our net sales for the quarter. So there was a little bit of a shift and some of that is obviously in reflection of what Donna guided to for Q2. And I think it again goes back to the strength of our brand and also the ability for us to game customers in advance of maybe sometimes when they were thinking of purchasing when others are on promotions. So we feel very good for quarter two. As Shawn shared, we've got a great perspective, having cleared frankly, Memorial Day, which is our biggest tentpole in this quarter. And we feel good with a strong quote pipeline, good promotional cadence and good in the stocks and the teams are really set to keep continuing to outperform as we demonstrate every single quarter. Shawn, I think, on promotions, and I'll touch on it and then I'll hand to you. I think the team continually demonstrate the ability to be agile and testing, as you can see by the results. We're very agile. We're actually getting better and better at being more programmatic in going directly to customers with quote versus site-wide flashes, but as Shawn shared, it's generally promotions have been holding the line since the second half of last year. You can see from our results, we've far exceeded anyone else. We continue to gain share and that's all just reinforcing the strength of our flywheel and that we are a company-specific product cycle story, not a macro demand business. So we feel good with the plans, but the teams will continue to adjust accordingly.\nShawn Nelson: Yes, I agree. Nothing to add, other than we'll continue to be really diligent on this front. We are focused on building the brand in the most long-term focused way possible even through tighter times and that's definitely affecting our outlook on promotions, in general, we intend to be really disciplined.\nBrian Nagel: I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nMary Fox: Thank you, Brian\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mary Ripps of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nMaria Ripps: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and Donna and Jack, best of luck going forward. It was great working with you. First, is there any indication as to whether consumer trends and maybe discretionary spend is getting better or worse over the past couple of months? Obviously, you reiterated your full year outlook. And then any color maybe you can add in terms of higher-end consumer versus more price-sensitive buyers here?\nMary Fox: Yes. Good morning, Maria. It's great to hear from you. So I think we've obviously just the year-end update a couple of months ago. We're not seeing anything that's significant from that or any consistent trade down trends. I think, in fact, actually, what we're seeing is that they've tended to have a flat or slightly elevated mix of premium upgrades in their purchase. We do see, as we shared before, the use of financing that continues to trend up versus last year, which we fully planned for. And as other brands have shared, we're actually seeing customers buying later at the end of a promotional event versus last year. And I think a lot of that, last year, they were buying because of concerns around availability, just in general in the market, and obviously, with that more secure for the category, people are holding back a bit. But I think that's consistent to what everyone else has shared and it's more settling back to pre-pandemic buying patterns. But I think we also see and I think Shawn shared this before, 38% of our customers don't even cross shop us with anyone else. So, they come in, they want to buy, they use the credit where they want to on the financing, but just the brand strength just continues as you can see in the results.\nMaria Ripps: Got it. That's very helpful. And then you talked about making some sort of infrastructure tech and R&D investments to support future growth. Could you maybe provide us with an update on how those initiatives are progressing? Maybe a little bit more color on what those investments are? And I guess which areas of the business they designed to impact the most?\nMary Fox: Yes. No, thank you for that question. So I think, firstly, on the tech investment, a key one. And I think as Donna shared, and I shared the ability for us to start to optimize on our inventory levels was some of the investments we started last year into this year, with order management systems and really the availability to be a lot more surgical around where we place inventory and how we replenish to orders. So that was a big investment. We're seeing that benefit that will come through, obviously, in working capital and also the ability to have less weeks of sale, but yet still delivering the outstanding continued improvements in customer satisfaction. The another example that we're investing in is around customer service. We shared with you before around some of the work there. And just obviously, more recently, we kicked off a pilot with an AI platform called Thankful, which is testing machine-generated responses for our frontline associates that are serving customers. And we think this investment in AI is so critical for our customer experience and then supporting our teams in all of their crucial work every day. So those are just a couple of examples on the tech side and then the rest of the investments that we have always shared is around research and development, which is for our long-term growth, Maria.\nMaria Ripps: That's very helpful. Thank you so much for the color, Mary.\nMary Fox: Thank you, Maria.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Thomas Forte of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nThomas Forte: Great. So first off, congrats, Shawn, Mary and team, Jack, best of luck. It was a pleasure working with you. I look forward to your guidance on the Board. Donna, I'm going to miss you. It's a pleasure working with you and best of luck as well. All right. So for my first question, then I'll pause and then a follow-up. So Shawn, I think, you did a great job with data analysis. What does the data tell you regarding consumers who may appreciate the functionality of their product, but don't purchase it or maybe they purchase it, but they don't buy it for more rooms in their house because of the aesthetics. And then can you talk about the Angled Side versus the Roll Arm when you rolled out the Roll Arm and how that had a positive impact on your results?\nShawn Nelson: Yes. So thanks for the question. Great to hear from you. Sactionals is a very successful couch platform because of its flexibility. It has taken us years of being in the marketplace, paying for research to continue to refine the platform and tease out where the biggest opportunities lie. And we continue to knock those out one after the other year after year as we continue to drive the Sactionals platform to become as we think of it, the Apex Predator in couches, right? We want it to be all things to all people as much as it can be. And so far, it's proving successful. And the results, of course, are in the -- the evidence is in the results. That said, we know that there are two core things that drive this business. One is comfort and Two is style. In the case of the Angled Side, we have both being addressed, and it's been a really effective launch. We knew that it would be based on our research and I think that really speaks to the strength of how Lovesac operates. We are a research-led organization. We blend this, call it, CPG approach to research, product development, customer development, customer research along with pure invention to generate platform that are uniquely competitive. And so we know that style is always going to be an issue when you're dealing with a product that was intentionally created to be evergreen, to be the same for years and years. Theoretically forever, hopefully, by taking a very vanilla and simple approach in a way that would offend nobody and hopefully be addressable -- be relevant to everybody. With that, there leaves tons of opportunity left on the table. So for instance, years ago, you mentioned we launched Roll Arm, as a way to address a more conservative traditional customer that is looking for that more traditional look in their home. And it was wildly successful, and it's been part of our Lovesac Sactionals ecosystem for years now. You can think of Angled Side as a more modern version of that. But Angled Side goes further because not only does it address an aesthetic that we did not have, but it also, frankly, provides a different comfort level than we offered up until now. Like when you get the chance to sit on an Angled Side because I understand the word side in our world is not just an arm, it's a back, it's interchangeable. So you can have all Angled Sides, all the way around and now your Sactionals will lean back a little further, the sitting space is a little larger. And it really sets the table for other innovations that will come as well that will further address comfort and aesthetics. So Sactionals already, what we witness happening is if people buy Sactionals for whatever room they have in mind for it. Often, it will be a basement, a bonus room who knows what because you can make them so large. You can integrate StealthTech and have surround sound. You can have these huge pit setups that kind of thing. And we'll take it. Those are huge purchases. But their experience is so good, of course, with Sactionals and that proves over time, right, as people spill, live their life, expand, make mistakes, animals, kids, dogs, pets, who knows what. And then we end up in other rooms in their home or even in their second homes or who knows what, because their experience with the brand is so good. That's what we like to see and the further that we expand the Sactionals platform, the more of that we make possible because people could have one look here and another look there, and we addressed those aesthetic opportunities. And so we're really excited about it. But Roll Arm was more niche than Angled Side, and we believe that the opportunity for Angled Side is even larger.\nThomas Forte: Excellent. Right. So then for my follow-up, I'll try to ask this one quicker. All right. So one of the big challenges for direct-to-consumer companies, and I consider you the best-in-class direct-to-consumer companies is driving brand awareness. So I wanted to know if you could talk about your unaided awareness and how that's changed over time? And if you could talk specifically about the social media engagement you had as it related to your 25th anniversary celebration, which was amazing.\nShawn Nelson: Yes. We have seen our unaided awareness continue to be quite low. And part of that is -- and I say that with a smile because it's just -- we have a huge opportunity to continue to reach people. While we have grown the business tremendously and we're proud of the growth, we have a long way to go on unaided awareness. And the way that we come at that are many -- through advertising, through promotion, through influencers, social media, et cetera. Our aided awareness has gone through the roof. In the furniture category, we are now up there with the best of them as brands that come to mind when brands that can be recognized on a sheet of paper, let's say, when given the opportunity. So Lovesac. So clearly, our advertising has been working. Again, the evidence is in the results. We recently celebrated our 25th anniversary with a huge media party kickoff in New York. We'll be celebrating it all year. So you'll get sick of hearing about it, but it really is super relevant to us for the reasons I talked about in my script. But we have estimated now more than 3 billion impressions from that event alone. We have an attendance all kinds of social media influencers, A List celebrities. Of course, we had Travis Barker and Machine Gun Kelly, on stage, who are all fans of Lovesac. All these celebrities who appeared, who support us, who even played our event are fans of Lovesac for many, many years to come and many, many years have been fans of Lovesac have owned our product. It's in their homes right now. So it's truly authentic. And this is one thing that's underestimated about Lovesac. We are resonating with teenagers and kids in ways that our competitors are not. And by the way, those kids are driving sales of sometimes $15,000, $20,000 StealthTech Sactionals setup in their parent's basement. I witness it every day personally. I meet people who have come to our brand through their children. And so it's not that, that's our core marketing philosophy. But my point is that this brand resonates with customers like no other furniture brand does. And we're really proud of that. It's a super power of ours, we think, and we'll continue to lean into it.\nThomas Forte: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Koranda of ROTH. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Koranda: Hey, guys. Good morning and congrats to Donna and Jack on a great run. Just wanted to start out with -- quickly just clarifying the showroom comp is ahead of revenue growth in the channel and I know there's a demand comp dynamic. So I just wanted to make sure that we understand what the delta is there and what the spillover is that's incorporated in the second quarter revenue guide? And then just also on May sales and Memorial Day, I know you mentioned it was up year-over-year. Just what were the key drivers in terms of the improvement on a year-over-year basis, was it promos. It sounds like you're seeing consumers respond to those. Just wanted to get your take on that as well.\nDonna Dellomo: Yes. Hi, Matt, it's Donna. Hopefully, I can provide some clarification. So our first, as I noted earlier that our first half comps are exactly in line where we thought they were going to be. There was a slight shift, which caused the overperformance in Q1, as we noted, where we had guided to $133 million to $136 million and came in at $141 million. And that was due to planned promotional activity at the end of Q1, but that planned promotional activity, obviously, it pulled forward demand. So, again, we're really happy with where we're going to end for first half comps, but it did -- our promotional activity at the end of the quarter was so well-received, it did. We're anticipating a pull forward in our guidance of demand. Does that help you on that piece? And that's -- one of the other things is where we talk about -- we also have orders on our balance sheet, we're sitting with about $13 million. I think it's about $13 million, $15 million worth of orders at the end of the quarter that we'll be shipping into Q2 and if you remember, our comps for showrooms are based on demand and not net sales. So that's where you see that little bit of flex where we're reporting higher demand than we are net sales. We're going to see a part of that demand that's in the comp number shift into Q2 that become sales. And that's the timing like that's at the actual end of the quarter. These are not orders that were -- that we took at the beginning of the quarter and they're still sitting there. It was just timing of promo and when we can ship. So essentially, our open orders turn into net sales within a week or so of the demand being created. But that timing of demand versus shipments is what you're also seeing flex in demand being higher than our net sales for the quarter for Q1.\nMary Fox: Yes. And then -- that on Memorial Day, Matt, to your question, obviously, we were thrilled with the performance, the promotion depth and frequency we've been holding in as a cadence in the second half of last year, so nothing new from that side. I think there was some excitement from the Angled Side soft launch, which is just obviously in showrooms at the moment. And then I think back to the investment that Shawn talked about, about our 25th anniversary and just the level of media impressions that we get then you just -- you see a long-term benefit to that as well as obviously in the quarter. But we were very pleased, and we've seen that performance continue from Memorial Day.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Great. And then just for my follow-up, on the margin guide for the second quarter. It sounded like, I think, Donna, you said up maybe 200 basis points on gross margins. I want to make sure I heard that correctly. What does that assume in terms of promotional cost headwinds on a year-over-year basis? Just trying to triangulate sort of around what you're assuming there versus some of the freight benefit. And then on the -- how that flows down to the adjusted EBITDA guide, just curious, it sounds like you're going to be leaning into marketing in the second quarter. So I just wanted to understand a bit more about where you guys see opportunity to invest those dollars on the marketing side.\nDonna Dellomo: Yes. So I'll start. Yes. So, Matt, that's correct. I did say a 200 basis point increase in gross margin, Q2 this year as compared to Q1 there the upside to gross margin from the benefits of the inbound freight is greater than the 200 basis points year-over-year increase. I don't have the specific numbers, but it's not only promotional activity. And as Mary has said and I think Shawn has said, we are a little bit more promotional than we were this time last year, but we are nowhere close to as promotional as we were pre-pandemic levels. So there is a little bit there in product margin. But we also, as I had noted, we do have some deleverage, I would call it, in outbound freight just as a relationship to cost increasing for us and everybody else. And a little bit of deleverage in our warehousing as we expand our warehouse network and costs there become a little bit more expensive just as relative to labor at the warehouses. Those are not our warehouses by the way, just to remind you, those are 3PLs. So that net of 200 basis points is greater inbound freight, which is netting down to 200 basis points because of increased year-over-year and product discounting as well as outbound freight costs and warehousing. The adjusted, yes, so your question on marketing, we will see a, where we saw in Q1 a slight leverage of marketing, I think it was about 30 basis points. We are expected to see because of the investments around our 25th brand building event in addition to Angled Side. Big, big, big things for Lovesac. We will see deleverage in marketing in Q2, specifically around those events. It all, put planned into guidance, planned into our annual guidance, it all accounted for in our quarter guidance. And SG&A, on a deleverage of SG&A, we are deleveraging approximately the same amount we did in Q1. So they're all the planned costs, their planned investments. And we will start to see all of those costs leveraging into the second half of the year, predominantly the fourth quarter. And that will all impact the adjusted EBITDA. But we feel really comfortable, very, very confident and we've built in all the costs that we can see coming our way. And any upside to those numbers, the team will decide strategically how to and when to reinvest those dollars.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Super helpful guys. Congrats again, Donna and Jack, and I'll turn back in queue.\nDonna Dellomo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Alex Fuhrman of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nAlex Fuhrman: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a strong quarter. And to Jack and Donna, it's been a pleasure getting to know you over the years. So congratulations to you both as well. Shawn, I wanted to ask about the -- just big picture here. You mentioned the average first-time transaction value for a Sactional purchase now is about $5,000. Is it feels like it was only maybe a couple of years ago that, that number was closer to $3,500. Can you kind of give us a sense of what are people buying today in terms of pieces and fabrics and things like that compared to what they were buying just a couple of years ago?\nShawn Nelson: Yes. Thanks for the question. Sactionals average order value has just continued to go through the roof year after year. It's been climbing steadily as you've witnessed. It's been a major part of our growth overall. And we're really proud of that. And that's driven by innovation. People are buying larger setup generally. I just think the bigger our brand gets, the more that aided and unaided awareness expands and the more that our brand is accepted in the marketplace is something that's not so fringe, something is not such an unknown people just get more comfortable, I think, spending with us and really taking the risk on bigger setups. And so that's number one. Number two, StealthTech, huge, huge driver of AOV for us. And we expect to see some of the same behavior around Angled Side. Remember, it also drives repeat business for us. But speaking specifically about that first purchase is what you asked, and that's what we're referencing, people that are buying Sactionals for the first time, that's where the largest dollar take is for us. We're totally focused on that. We've been focused on that for years. We'll continue to be focused on it. As much as we feel really great about our growth and our success and how much just the sheer size of Lovesac compared to what it was two or three years ago even. The reality is we're still just a small fraction of this upholstery category, just a small fraction. Because it's so splintered, it's so fragmented, and it's vast. Every home that you know of have a couch in it. We intend to be there. We think we make the best one, and we'll continue to make it better through innovations like the Angled Side. And so that's -- all this innovation is what's driving that first purchase that have combined with our brand cloud. And that's where all of our investments are. All of our focus, social media, marketing, everything is all part of that effort.\nAlex Fuhrman: That's really helpful. Thank you, Shawn.\nShawn Nelson: Yes. Great to hear from you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Nelson for closing comments.\nShawn Nelson: Yes. Thank you so much for joining today. We look forward to another year of growth as we build toward our longer-term ambitions. We appreciate the continued support of all of our investors and hope to create continued value for all stakeholders with our commitment to this Designed for Life way of doing business. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast, and enjoy the rest of your day."
