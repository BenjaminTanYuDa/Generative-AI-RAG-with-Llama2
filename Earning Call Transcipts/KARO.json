        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to Karooooo’s FY 2024 Q3 Earnings Call. On behalf of Karooooo, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. I'm Carmen, the Group's Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, and together with Hoeshin, our Group Chief Financial Officer, we will be taking you through our strong business updates and financials. All investors are advised to read through the disclaimer. We will be reviewing all three of Karooooo's business units in today's webinar, namely, Cartrack, Carzuka and Karooooo Logistics. Karooooo remains committed to our mission of being the leading operations cloud. Our focus is to simplify the lives of operators and maximize the scale and efficiency of their operation. Our innovative platform goes far beyond connected vehicles and equipment to centralize and unify an entire operation into one single place. We are helping to pave the benchmark and future of efficiency, safety and impact for operational businesses. Fundamentally, every operation wants to achieve safety targets and compliance targets and well-being targets, but historically these have come at the compromise of the core survival and success targets of a business, productivity and efficiency. Having a tool that solves complex problems in simple ways is no small feat, and this is a constant driver for our strong growth at scale. Everything is embedded together. The tool that automatically flags potential fuel fraud to save thousands is the same tool that automates carbon emission tracking. The tool that optimises routes to slash mileage and fuel consumption also makes drivers' lives easier and puts them at ease to ensure they get paid for every minute they worked. When burdens like maintenance are well managed, they become strong differentiators for operators and this is easily done through our automation and integrations. Karooooo's platform allows operators to prioritize safety and compliance with heightened productivity. Karooooo's AI powered cameras are redefining the boundaries of visibility. These cameras stand as safety pioneers, revealing hidden risks and enabling proactive responses. From slashing accidents to exonerating innocent drivers, their profound impact transcends industries. A key factor contributing to the success of our platform is its smooth integration into our customers' various operational workflows. In challenging environments like mines, traditional methods such as sit-down discussions on driving styles may not be feasible. Recognizing the significance of training, our innovative approach involves utilizing our risk management control room tool and two-way in-cab communication tools for on-the-spot training and immediate action. The generated alerts ensure prompt intervention and risk mitigation, such as directing drivers to rest when fatigued. The outcome has been transformative, with a remarkable 59% reduction in fatigued or distracted driving in just four months, resulting in an overall decrease in accidents. In other industries, establishing formal training is feasible and driver incentives are based on safety scores. A leading mass bus company transporting around 1 million passengers daily has revolutionized an industry and made significant impact on community safety with a 41% decrease in fatigue and distracted driving in just three months. Not only has this led to positive branding as commuters see the change and feel safer, but it has also boosted operational efficiencies by reducing accidents and minimizing the associated downtime. Accidents involving company vehicles often result in substantial maintenance and insurance expenses, protracted legal disputes, and employee disgruntlement. Our cloud-based footage has revolutionized the way companies address accidents, providing a straightforward means to investigate incidents and exonerate their teams. This approach enables companies to establish clear mandates around liabilities, streamlining compliance and boosting employee morale. Workers appreciate a tool that prevents unwarranted blame leading to increased employee retention, whilst businesses benefit by avoiding unwarranted bills that often rack up to tens of thousands of dollars. In an era where safety is taking center stage, our cameras are reshaping how we approach risk management, worker well-being, community safety, and operational efficiency. Our operations cloud drives digital transformation for over 113,000 commercial customers with a 95% retention rate across businesses of varying sizes in diverse markets and industries. We continue to empower the day-to-day operations of our customers with our Data Enhance platform, enabling them to make informed decisions with actionable intelligence about their own fleet, as well as others in their industries. The continuous evolution of our platform ensures ongoing enhancements, driving increased returns for our customers, whilst we keep our ARPU stable. The value proposition of our platform is massive and we have a huge runway for growth. Our culture, founded on customer centricity, transparency and solution orientated thinking, sets us apart. We attract top talent that thrives on challenges and values hard work over frills, fostering a team that leads by example. From infield technicians to decision makers, our team's curiosity, ingenuity and diverse experience results in a powerhouse of innovation and successful execution. Our unique culture, while not for everyone, cultivates resourceful individuals driven to efficiently solve complex problems. I will now hand over to Hoeshin, who will take us through our financial performance.\nGoy Hoeshin: Thank you, Carmen. I will now talk through Karooooo's financial performance for Q3 FY 2024. Please note that all comparisons are against Q3 FY 2023, unless otherwise stated. Quarter three has proven to be an exciting period for us. Our well-established and profitable SaaS business model and robust financial position provide us with multiple levels for growth. And our primary focus remains on growing our subscription revenue. Our subscription revenue grew 17% to ZAR904 million and our ARR demonstrated an increase of 20% to ZAR3,711 million. Operating profit increased by 31% to ZAR275 million and our earnings per share grew 35% to ZAR6.34 despite our prudent provision made in the quarter relating to Carzuka's reduced operations. All segments continue to see strong tractions with the benefits of our strategic investment beginning to show. Earnings in this quarter stood at ZAR199 million and our free cash flow are at ZAR162 million. Our free cash flow has remained positive over the last eight quarters despite our investment in the development of our new South Africa Central office. Up to this quarter, we had invested ZAR231 million in this development. Our high cash conversion are demonstrated through our strong financial discipline as we continue to invest for our future growth. Our net cash on hand stood at ZAR782 million in this quarter. Debtor's turnover days improving to 30 days alongside with prudent provisioning to weather off strong economic headwinds in some of the market we are operating. We have strong unit economics, robust operating margins, unleveraged balance sheet and a strong cash conversion. We remain confident that our track record of success, especially our ability to generate healthy cash flow is sustainable. Despite our provision in the quarter for Carzuka, our earnings per share increased by 35% to ZAR6.34. The increase is the result of positive revenue growth and improved profitability, notwithstanding with our prudent and strategic investment for growth. Carzuka has negatively impacted our earnings per share by ZAR0.75, in line with the provision we make in the quarter as Carzuka reduces its operations. Based on our estimates, we believe we have made adequate provision, and going forwardly, we do not expect Carzuka to have significant impact on our earnings per share. We will now focus on Cartrack, the underlying assets to Karooooo's success. Our momentum continued in this quarter as Cartrack extended its decade-plus track record of growth at scale, profitability and cash generation ability. Overall, subscribers grew at scale by 14% to over 1.9 million. Subscription revenue grew 17% to ZAR900 million, while operating profit grew to ZAR295 million. Cartrack’s consistently proves its ability to scale in diverse macroeconomic conditions and consistently beaten the Rule of 40. And in this quarter, Cartrack saw a 34% growth in earnings per share, reaching ZAR6.96. Our earnings are benefiting from our robust economy soft skills. The expansion of Cartrack subscribers based by 14% to 1.9 million reflects our highly successful rate of implementation and strong customer retention across various businesses. The demand from small to large enterprises looking to enhance compliance function and embark on a digital transformation journey for increased efficiency and competitiveness in their operations remain high. Cartrack’s total subscription revenue grew 17% to ZAR900 million and represent 98% of total revenue. Total revenue grew 14% to ZAR990 million. Our SaaS ARR grew 20% to ZAR3,695 million, showcasing the strength and growth potential of our SaaS business model. As Cartrack continues to have strong visibility of its future SaaS revenue, our realisation of economy of scale continues to demonstrate our ability to expand margins. In this quarter, gross profit grew 19% to ZAR672 million and gross profit margin grew 3% to 73%. Despite the investment for growth, Cartracks operating profit grew 33% to ZAR295 million and operating profit margin grew 4% to 32%. Our adjusted EBITDA grew 29% to ZAR447 million and adjusted EBITDA margin are at 49%. Cartracks low cost of acquiring a customer, high customer lifetime value and retention rate, as well as strong benefits from economies of scale result in our leading unit economics. Our LTV to CAC is over 9. We have strong profit margins with our gross profit margin on subscription revenue at 75% and commercial customer retention rate of 95%. With our track record, we are well-positioned to continue to increase our market share. Over the years, Cartrack has maintained a steady ARPU, an average upfront cost of acquiring a subscriber. ARPU for the quarter was ZAR160. Cartracks average lifetime revenue per subscriber in this quarter stood at ZAR9,629. The average upfront cost of adding a subscriber to our cloud in this quarter was ZAR2,160. These costs mainly relates to sales commission and telematic device, which are capitalised and sales and marketing expenses that are expensed off. The headroom, derived from the average lifetime revenue per subscriber, after subtracting the average upfront cost of adding a subscriber was ZAR7,469 per subscriber. From the ZAR7,469, we incurred a cost to service the subscriber over the contract life cycle of 60 months. The cost to service a subscriber decreased as we grow our subscriber base. Our unit economics has remained steady, allowing us a strong operating profit. Cartrack continued to grow its subscriber base and ARR to expand in all geographies. Our subscribers in South Africa grew by 12% despite the challenging trading conditions. Given that we continuously pass on additional benefits to our customer and have a rich data pool, we believe we will continue to see strong customer demand in this region. In Asia, the Middle East and USA subscriber grew by 26% as the traction in Southeast Asia has been encouraging. Southeast Asia remain as the second largest contributor to the Group's revenue, presenting the most compelling growth opportunity and deliver increasing and sustainable income to the group in medium to long term. Europe saw a healthy growth of 15% and remains a region we are focusing our resources on. With our recent partnership with leading OEMs, we are poised to leverage our extensive offerings to future develop the connected vehicle ecosystem and expect these partnerships to contribute to our results in medium term. In addition, we are experiencing encouraging demand for our proprietary compliance technology in the region. Africa others maintained its growth with 8% increase in subscriber. At the end of quarter three, our ARR increased 20% to ZAR3,695 million. This is a good trending as we continue to see the momentum of growth in our subscriber and ARR. Cartracks continue to have robust operating margins, and our trends are in line with the long-term financial goals set out upon our listing in 2021. Our subscription revenue gross profit margin stood at 72%, which is consistent with our expectation. Research and development expense as a percentage of subscription revenue are 6% as we focus on driving substantial benefit from our R&D capital allocation. Our planned investment in improving, enriching and expanding our operation cloud and internal management system is to enhance our value proposition to our customers. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of subscription revenue increased to 14%. We believe the strategic investment for customer acquisition position us well for continued growth and we expect to see future benefits from this investment. General and admin expenses as a percentage of subscription revenue are at 21%. The expenses has been relatively stable to reflect our commitment to build a strong support infrastructure to meet our future growth plan, yet being pragmatic in our spending. Operating profit as a percentage of subscription revenue are 30% and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of subscription revenue is at 48%. As we continue with our momentum in quarter three, we are pleased with our progress so far. Our outlook for Cartracks remains and we maintain our guidance with number of subscribers between 1.9 million to 2.1 million, Cartrack subscription revenue between 3.4 million to 3.6 million rand and Cartracks operating profit margin between 28% to 31%. Karooooo Logistics delivered significant growth generating ZAR91 million in revenue and a commendable operating profit of ZAR7 million in this quarter. Its focus on delivery as a service through selected third-party crowd source drivers and logistics companies has been highly scalable and is delivering substantial growth. While we continue to integrate into Cartracks platform to expand its customer base, the Karooooo Logistics stack is expected to deliver a long-term revenue stream to the group. We believe the benefits of our strategic investment in this segment are starting to manifest. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today and we will now open the floor to Q&A with our group CEO and founder Mr. Zak Calisto.\nZak Calisto: We do use part of the Carzuka's IP for the broader spectrum of Cartrack business. So we intend at this point in time to continue using the Carzuka IP, although we're very aware that we could sell part of it if we wanted to. We're not certain at this point in time if we sold it and we made another, whether that wouldn't just create another competitor that would upset the OEMs and the dealerships. So we've sort of got to tread carefully and decide if we do sell it to be outside South Africa. On a scale of 1 to 10, how does Cartrack performing in Southeast Asia and Europe relative to your expectations? I think Miles, we definitely are on target with our budgets. Clearly, what we would like to do is start growing faster and we definitely -- that's exactly what we plan to do. Do you see growth in South East Asia and Europe scaling fast in FY 2025 than in the current financial year? I think in the results of the next quarter we're certainly going to give the outlook and there we will be more firm in what we believe we can deliver. The next question coming from Matt from William Blair. Can you update us on the progress with the OEMs? I think the progress has been slow, but we certainly believe that once that progress starts, it's definitely going to be a kicker for attracting business and for customer acquisition. So we remain very hopeful that our integrations with the OEMs and our current collaboration with them is going to yield good results. Another question from Matt from William Blair. How is Asia performing relative to your expectations? And Matt, we are seeing in equivalents with our forecasts and our budgets for the year and we certainly are doing a lot in the background to really increase our activity. Like I said earlier, I think within the next three months or so we'll be giving better guidance for FY 2025. A question from [Sandili] (ph). Can you maintain debtors' days at 30 going into FY 2025? I certainly believe that whether you got your debtors at 30 or 35, it's not much of a difference. And I think whether we're going to maintain it at 29, 31, it's all very healthy. So we've traditionally always had a very healthy debtors book. Historically, we've had a very healthy debtors book. You said that free cash flow continues to benefit from prior investment efforts. Can you expect this trend to continue from this point? If you look at the slide that Hoeshin presented, our conversion over the last 24 months has actually been earnings as practically equaled our free cash flow. Obviously, that is, if you take into account that we are deploying capital into building the building in Rosebank, which is going to be our South African head office, which is a very important investment. So once that building is built, then -- and if we continue growing at this pace, earnings and free cash flow equals. However, if we start growing much faster, then free cash flow will start coming down, simply because of our investment in customer acquisition. And similarly if our investment -- if our growth slows down further, then our free cash flow will be higher than our earnings. Can you provide guidance for Carzuka Q4 loss? Well that's all been already provided and we believe, given our estimates, that we are now fully provided for the Carzuka losses and we expect Q4 not to have any losses in Carzuka. And if there are, it will be minimally insignificant. So we expect really our earnings just to be Karooooo Logistics and Cartrack, the addition of those two. Question from Alex Sklar. Was there anything one-time benefiting the strong 73% gross margin result? There was a little bit of a credit note on certain costs that came through in Q3, but they're not significant. And, we're quite used to historically seeing these types of gross profit margins, so there's nothing untowards it [indiscernible]. So I think a good gross profit target is 72% to 73%. I think that region is where we feel very comfortable. And at this point in time, if you look at year-to-date, we're at 72%. So I think that's very healthy and very much in accordance with our estimates. Sales and marketing was down slightly quarter-on-quarter, can you talk about the capacity for gross ads you have in the current [server] (ph) base? How are you thinking about sales and plans for the next 12 months? Alex, we are very busy with the recruitment process to hire for actually the next 24 months. And we certainly believe that our investment, we're really going to invest quite a lot in that whole process and I believe we're going to get the benefits out of that going forward. A question from Matthew from Confluence Impact Fund. Good subscriber for quarter growth in Asia. Please could you give details of the split of subscriber growth by country? What is the outlet for future growth? I haven't got the subscriber by country and we don't really give that. But obviously our strong countries in the region are Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia. A question from [Rudy Fanickak] (ph). Karooooo Logistics growing strongly. What is the scope for growth? How meaningful could operating profit contribute in the medium term? Rudy, I imagine that operating profit in the medium term will still become relatively insignificant to the group. However, it's really what we're building on the Cartrack platform that can be very meaningful to the group. So we'll over the next 12 months get better visibility out that will actually increase our [indiscernible] in Cartrack. Question from Chris Logan. Given the under-penetrated market and scale in Southeast Asia and possibly Europe, would it not make sense for consolidation to occur in a slow-growing and mature South African market? I think, Chris, my personal view is that, South Africa has got still a lot of room for greenfield opportunity, and it's also got room to take market share from our competitors. Clearly we're very focused at this point in time from greenfield opportunity. And consolidation could be tricky and quite frankly I'm not certain it would be healthy for consolidation at this point in time, but maybe in four or five years-time it would be a good thing to consolidate. Another question from Miles Ferrie. When will the new headquarters in South Africa be in operation and will you hold the Q4 results in the premises? We will start according to our plans. It was, the handover was planned for July this year for us to get the building. We're not looking at moving into the building at the end of May this year. So we probably two months or so before the planned date. Our debtor days trended down over the last year. Is 30 days the norm? I think I've answered that in a previous question. Thank you, everybody. That's the questions for today. And thank you. Should anybody have any questions, please reach out to Lauren and send them an email. Thank you very much. Bye-bye."

        "content": "Carmen Calisto: Hello, and welcome to Karooooo's Fiscal Financial Year 2024 Q2 Earnings Call. On behalf of Karooooo, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. I'm Carmen, the Group's Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer; and together with Hoeshin, our Group Chief Financial Officer, we will be taking you through our strong business updates and financials. All investors are advised to read through the disclaimer. We will be reviewing all three of Karooooo's business units in today's webinar, namely Cartrack, Carzuka, and Karooooo Logistics. Karooooo continues to believe in our mission to be the leading operations cloud and we see how we are helping to set the path for tomorrow for operational businesses with our platform. Industry-leading customers consult with us on how to improve their operations and tackle their day-to-day challenges. And our ability to think beyond connected vehicles and equipment has been pivotal in delivering a cloud that connects an entire operation in one place to achieve real business impact. Despite the varying macroeconomic environments we encountered, digitalization, ESG and compliance continue to be strong drivers for demand of our platform. Our platform offers the flexibility customers need to digitalize their operation at their own pace, and in a way that makes sense for them. Whether it is digital forms that facilitate workers and drivers to complete their workflows effectively via mobile app, coaching solutions that generate success and provide accountability, risk management tools that enable quick resolutions and full audit trails, automated carbon emission reporting and progress tracking or detailed productivity reporting for optimized operations, our platform fits into an operation for success. Additionally, customers can integrate with their existing tools such as fuel card providers and ERPs to further curate insights that suit their needs. By partnering with our customers to understand their operation and help tackle their challenges, we get deep insight and knowledge to continue adding innovative features to our platform to further increase the value customers get and the importance we play in optimizing their operation. Our platform brings both operational and non-operational teams together and helps companies remain compliant, competitive in their industries, and most importantly, forward-thinking. To illustrate how our platform impacts a customer's operation, we can take a look into an existing customer. A large furniture manufacturer that delivers their own goods needed a way to alleviate their administrative burden whilst improving their operations with delivery fees often impacting a customer's decision to buy, offering competitive rates was critical to their operation. After 10 days of implementing our delivery management tool, our customers saw returns at large with our easy-to-use solution that optimizes all jobs across drivers and provides optimal routes, as well as a practical mobile app for drivers to receive everything they need to excel at their job, our customers successfully saved four liters of diesel per vehicle per day. With this reduction, they're on track to exceeding their sustainability goals and reducing their carbon emissions by over 2,800 kilograms per vehicle per year. The payback period of our solution is under three days and the ROI is over 700%, and this is purely looking at the fuel cost savings. If we were to account for the manpower cost saved on dispatching and managing drivers, as well as communicating with customers and collecting payment after delivery with our electronic proof of delivery, ROI would further increase. This goes to highlight Karooooo's strong value proposition and the impact our cloud platform has in streamlining operations, lowering environmental impact and helping businesses thrive in a more robust and competitive business landscape. The same way reaching for a phone has become second nature to society, many drivers are unaware of their actions as well as the risks these actions have on their safety. What feels like half a second of screen time is actually five, or a harmless yawn is actually the first sign of falling asleep at the wheel. Beyond harsh driving behavior detected by telemetry, AI cameras have given a new dimension to both managers and drivers to overcome high-risk driving behavior. Real-time audible alerts have proven critical in enabling drivers to correct their behavior in real-time to avoid collisions and accidents. Whilst with total visibility of events that previously went undetected, managers are now equipped to establish effective training programs and monitor the progress of drivers towards a safety-first working environment. AI cameras allow for a preventative and proactive approach to safety. A customer that transports fuel has seen a 46% decrease in high-risk driver events detected by our AI after three calendar months of implementation. These events include fatigue, mobile phone usage, other distracted driving and tailgating. And accidents with a vehicle carrying such sensitive cargo is not only detrimental to drivers' lives but also can cause vast negative public relations that can have a long-lasting negative effects on a business. Avoiding these high-risk events reduces accidents, and implementing this technology has enhanced our customers' reputation for strong service delivery, which has led to increased business growth. The benefits of increased safety are far-reaching. Not only this does lead to safer communities and better working environments, but it reduces cost substantially through reduced accident repairs, maintenance fees, and insurance premiums. Drivers feel more loyal to companies as they feel the fruits of the investments and end customers feel more confident in the ability of our customers to exceed expectations. We encourage companies to work with their drivers by investing in their coaching and education. And as the benefits and success of these solutions gain traction, we believe we will continue to see increased government mandates around the implementation of this technology as a means to increase safety for communities. Our robust customer growth across industries is testament to our proven business model, competitive differentiators and strong financial position, and we continue to see no customer or industry concentration risk. With over a decade of insights into operations and how our customers work, we are able to pinpoint what will drive business value and are incorporating AI and machine learning into our platform to enhance our solution. From accident and fuel fraud detection to industry insights and benchmarks, our customers are reaping the benefits from our vast data scale and network effects, and we will continuously enhance our platform to further increase these benefits. Our progress remains aligned with our ethos and long-term strategy to drive unparalleled value to the day-to-day operations of our customers. There is ample runway for growth and our team is motivated to deliver on it. The investor community at large has continued to ask many questions around our culture and teams. We understand that running an operation the way we do is no small feat, and we believe that our culture empowers us to deliver on key market differentiators that are difficult to replicate. We are open and transparent, and we zero in on execution, not politics. Our solution-orientated mindset continuously focuses on better solving customer pain points. We attract top talent that does not step away from a challenge and is not afraid to try something new, people that believe in hard work, less frills and more action. It is not easy to take ownership of work, but for our entrepreneurial and customer-centric teams, this is a key result of the innovation and creativity they continuously demonstrate. As with most things, talking is easy, but our teams lead by example. We have had team members work their way from infield technicians to key decision-makers, from analysts to leading country managers. Not only does this show our teams the progression and reward they can achieve in their career, but it also creates a team with a diverse set of experience, skill and knowledge that is able to empathize with the challenges faced by our diverse customers to solve them. We have a loyal team with a deep business and industry understanding required to build scalable tools that unleash the potential of operational businesses. Our culture is not for everybody, but the people that fit our DNA are resourceful, ingenious, and have a strong desire and ability to solve complex problems efficiently. They collaborate and combine their knowledge from diverse industries and geographies to deliver on easy-to-use solutions in a quick and efficient way. Our staff are motivated by the success we see in our customers and this places us in the privileged position of working with a team that has a long-term mindset that is designed to win. I will now hand over to Hoeshin, who will take us through our financial performance.\nGoy Hoeshin: Thank you, Carmen. I will now talk through Karooooo's financial performance for quarter two FY '24. Please note that all comparisons are against quarter two FY '23 unless otherwise stated. Our quarter two performance has gained momentum, building from our solid start of the year and demonstrating growth across various financial metrics. As expected, after substantial investment for future growth, in quarter two, Karooooo's total subscription revenue increased by 17% to ZAR860 million. Operating profit increased by 13% to ZAR247 million and earnings per share increased 14% to ZAR5.61. Our profitable SaaS business model continue to bolster our cash flow generation ability. Net cash from operating activity increased by 26% to ZAR304 million. This healthy cash generation will continue to support our future cash outflow required for investment and future growth. All segments continue to see strong traction with the benefits of our strategic investment beginning to show. Our consistent results extend our track record of growth at scale, profitability and cash generation ability. After paying a dividend of $26.3 million and investing ZAR87 million in the development of the South African Central Office, our net cash on hand stood at ZAR651 million. Debtor's turnover days improving to 29 days alongside with prudent provisioning to weather off strong economic headwinds in some of the market we are operating. We have strong unit economics, robust operating margins, unleveraged balance sheet and a strong cash conversion. We remain confident that our track record of success, especially our ability to generate healthy cash flow is sustainable. Our earnings per share increased by 14% to ZAR5.61. The increase is the result of positive revenue growth and improved profitability despite our prudent and strategic investment for growth. We will now focus on Cartrack, the underlying asset to Karooooo's success. Cartrack continued to prove its ability to scale in varying macroeconomic conditions and consistently beaten the Rule of 40. Overall, subscriber grew at scale by 14% to over 1.83 million. And in this quarter, subscription revenue grew at 17% to ZAR858 million, while operating profit stood at ZAR252 million. Our solid start in quarter one continued as we gained momentum in quarter two with a record net subscriber additions of over 75,000 in this quarter. This was largely supported by the increasing demand of small to large enterprise, emphasizing the necessity to enhance compliance functions and digitally transform their businesses to become more efficient and competitive. Cartrack continued to build on its solid track record of growing at scale and experienced strong customer acquisition in this quarter. Cartrack's total subscription revenue grew 17% to ZAR858 million and represent 97% of total revenue, which is in line with our SaaS business model. Total revenue grew 17% to ZAR884 million. Our SaaS ARR grew 17% to ZAR3,475 million. Cartrack's operating profit grew 13% to ZAR252 million and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% to ZAR417 million. Over the years, Cartrack has maintained a steady ARPU and average upfront cost of acquiring a subscriber. ARPU for the quarter was ZAR159. Cartrack's average lifetime revenue per subscriber in this quarter stood at ZAR9,556. The average upfront cost of adding a subscriber to our cloud in this quarter was ZAR2,293. These costs mainly relates to sales commission and telematic device which are capitalized and sales and marketing expense that are expensed off. The headroom, derived from the average lifetime revenue per subscriber after subtracting the average upfront cost of adding a subscriber was ZAR7,263 per subscriber. From the ZAR7,263, we incurred a cost to service a subscriber over the contract lifecycle of 60 months. The cost to service a subscriber decrease as we grow our subscriber base. Our unit economics has been steady, allowing us strong operating profits. Cartrack continues to grow its subscriber base and ARR to expand in all geographies. The South African economy remains under pressure as a result of continuing strain on the national power grid. Despite the challenging trading conditions, our subscriber grew by 14%. In Asia, the Middle East, and USA, subscriber grew by 26% as the traction in Southeast Asia has been encouraging. Southeast Asia remain as the second largest contributor to the Group's revenue and we believe our value proposition will continue to find favor in this region and present the most compelling growth opportunity, and deliver increasing and sustainable income to the Group in medium to long term. Europe saw a healthy growth of 14% and remain a region we are focusing our resources on. With our recent partnership with leading OEMs, we are poised to leverage our extensive offering to further develop the connected vehicle ecosystem and expect this partnership to contribute to our results in medium term. In additions, we are experiencing encouraging demand for our proprietary compliance technology in the region. Africa others maintains its growth with 8% increase in subscriber. At the end of quarter two, our ARR increased 17% to ZAR3,475 million. This is at a good trending as we continue to see the momentum of growth in our subscriber and ARR. Cartrack has continued to have robust operating margins and our trends are in line with the long-term financial goals set upon our listing in 2021. In this quarter, our subscription revenue gross profit margin stood at 72%, which is consistent with our expectation. Research and development expense, as a percentage of subscription revenue, are 6%, as we focus on driving substantial benefit from our R&D capital allocation. Our planned investment in improving, and reaching, and expanding our operation cloud and internal management system is to enhance our value proposition to our customer. Sales and marketing expense, as a percentage of subscription revenue, increased to 14%. We believe the strategic investment for customer acquisition positioned us well for continued growth and we expect to see future benefit from this investment. General and admin expenses as a percentage of subscription revenue are at 22%. This planned increase reflects management's commitment to build a strong support infrastructure to meet our future growth plan. Operating profit as a percentage of subscription revenue are 29%, and our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of subscription revenue is at 49%. We have had a solid start and we are happy with the progress we have made in quarter two. Our guidance for Cartrack's outlook remain unchanged with number of subscribers between 1.9 million to 2.1 million, Cartrack's subscription revenue between ZAR3.4 million to ZAR3.6 million, and Cartrack's operating profit margin between 28% to 31%. Carzuka delivered ZAR85 million in revenue in this quarter and an operating loss of ZAR13 million. Subsequent to the quarter two end, despite the growth experienced by Carzuka in South Africa, a decision was made to cease buying second-hand vehicles in South Africa. This decision follows considerable interaction with motor dealership over the last 12 months. Over the years, Cartrack has been partnering with dealership as part of its customer acquisition strategy to acquire customer through the introduction of this dealership. However, some dealership has perceived the Carzuka business interests to be conflicting with their business interest in buying vehicles from customers. We maintain that the Carzuka business model is robust, but we do not want to reach the long-standing strategic relationship that Cartrack has forged with motor dealership across South Africa. Karooooo Logistics delivered significant growth generating ZAR72 million in revenue and an encouraging operating profit of ZAR8 million in this quarter. This focus on delivery as a service through selected third-party crowdsourced drivers and logistic companies have been highly scalable and is delivering substantial growth. While we continue to integrate into Cartrack's platform to expand its customer base, the Karooooo Logistics stack is expected to deliver a long-term revenue stream to the Group. We believe the benefits of our strategic investment in this segment are beginning to show. I would like to thank everybody for joining us today, and we will now open the floor to Q&A with our Group CEO and Founder, Mr. Zak Calisto.\nA - Zak Calisto: Myles, sometimes, these words are a bit of jargon and so data-as-a-service is currently what we do do, the way I understand it. And we basically take raw data, push the data through the IoT devices into our cloud. We obviously then work with data and keep intelligent business reports to our customers. So in our opinion, a great portion of our subscription revenue model is already data-as-a-service, which we obviously offer it is as a software-as-a-service. And so I think, either I'm not understanding your question or that's my answer. The next question comes from [indiscernible] I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing your name correctly. So apologies Sebastian if that's wrong. Can you expand further on the decision to shut down Carzuka in South Africa. Will there be any costs associated to closing this division? So, basically we have one lease that it comes to closure during this financial year. So there is no real material costs. We've got in contract at this point in time about 500 vacancies open and the majority of the Carzuka staff, we will transition into Cartrack. So there is no major costs. Clearly, these costs could have a slight impact on Cartrack initially but that’s been planned and it'll be phased, I think by the time we get to FY '25, these costs won't be weighing us down. So I think, the reality is we've been losing -- losses -- operating losses of approximately ZAR50 million a year and we see this loss disappearing and it will reflect positively in our earnings next year, although I do believe that had we spent enough effort in the last 12 months to really put our shoulders beyond Carzuka, we would have been much further. But we've been in long discussions with our partners, which is basically the motor dealers, where a few of them are saying that we've got a conflict of interests with them and we've decided to save these longstanding relationships and drive the -- continue keeping our relationships with the motor dealers healthy. The next question comes from Matthew from Confluence Impact Fund. Hi, it's Matthew, I’m from Confluence Impact Fund. Thank you for the presentation. Congratulations on progress in these results. Despite the growth experienced by Carzuka, the decision remains to cease buying secondhand vehicles. What does this mean for Carzuka? Will you be buying/selling vehicles instead from [what different source are the dealers] (ph)? So we have got the platform. We have developed a software for Carzuka. We will still utilize the software for the benefit of our dealers. So currently quite a lot of our dealers advertise the secondhand vehicles on the Carzuka platform. We then assist them in them selling the pre-owned vehicles. And we don't see this in any way completing, so we will still be able to -- anyone that wants to advertise on our platform, they are more than willing to do it, but we will not be taking inventory in buying and selling secondhand vehicles, but we will certainly allow our partners, the dealerships, to still get the benefit that they’ve reaped until now. Alex Sklar. Cartrack operating margin is up nicely this quarter. Can you talk about operating margin expectations for Q3 and Q4 given you're absorbing Carzuka employees? It could certainly have a negative impact on Cartrack, but it's really a planned impact that we would have done anyway because we need to employ the staff, but I don't believe this impact is material. The staff moving over to Cartrack is strategic. We know the people. So we already know the strengths and weaknesses and where to put them into which departments. So it's all really just helping us for about 500 vacancies that we currently have at the moment. Matthew from William Blair. Has the net subscriber amount in the second quarter continued into the third quarter? Matthew, yes it has. So in the first 40 days of Q3, our net subscriber additions were actually 40,000. So we are expecting to probably be over 80,000 net subscribers during Q3. That is our expectation for Q3 given that we're halfway through Q3. Another question from Matthew from William Blair. Can you provide an update on the OEM relationships? When could it start to contribute to subscriber additions? We have done a lot of integrations already with the European OEMs. We should be able to start seeing fruits from these relationships in FY '25. Matthew from Confluence. Please, can you comment on the proposed merger between MiX Telematics and PowerFleet? Which geographies do you overlap in? I must say, Matthew, I'm not very familiar with PowerFleet. MiX, I'm relatively familiar with them. So if my understanding is correct, PowerFleet is very much American-based, but -- so I prefer not to comment because I don't really know. I haven't delved into this information. I don't know. Do you focus on different customers or routes to market? If we compare ourselves to MiX, I do not believe that we focus on different customers or different routes to market. What differentiates your offer from MiX and PowerFleet? I think there's multiple vendors with our types of solutions. I think our route to market, although at a high level, it looks similar. But fundamentally, when you get into the detail, we're quite different. MiX operates in about 100 geographies, we only operate in 23. We are a great believer that we need to have staff on the ground in all the countries. We do not distribute in countries where we don't have presence -- physical presence. And I think that makes quite a big difference. And then obviously, we're very much focused on owning the customer and that could also be a little bit of a difference between us and MiX, potentially, but I'm speaking under correction. Next question from Sandile Magagula. Cartrack's EBITDA margin is at 47%. Why can't we reach the bottom at this level? Can you allow margin to trend below [47%] (ph) mark? We've traditionally had our EBITDA margins between about 45% or 44% and about 52%. We believe that will continue. It depends how much capital we've allocated into back-office, into sales, and it's a timing thing. We envisage that we'll remain in these sort of margins for quite a few years to come. Secondly, in terms of South Africa subscriber growth, at which year would you expect growth rates in subscribers to peak given the 13% growth you've achieved in Q2? In South Africa, we've got about 1.4 million vehicles on our cloud. We believe we can drive that to about 3 million vehicles. Obviously, we'll try to do that as quickly as possible. Currently, we're growing -- we're starting to see better momentum in growth in Q2 compared to Q1. And Q3, we continue with that momentum. Thirdly, the plan is to integrate Carzuka software. What is the estimated impact on introduction? I think I've covered that. Fourth question. Where do you see Cartrack return on common equity peaking over the coming years? Well, there's many ways of calculating that. So we've got quite a lot of cash. So if you give out the cash as a dividend, then obviously you'll be in a situation that your return on equity spikes. You're certainly making better returns for us than handing over your earnings in the form of dividends. At what phase of growth cycle of the business would it make sense for you to buff forward the dividend, given that the naturally high cash conversion rates, especially investments in organic growth can peak? I'd rather stay away from that question simply because we're quite pragmatic in the way we run the business. We've got sufficient cash to accelerate growth, and we intend keeping a solid cash base on our balance sheet like we've been doing. And we're generating quite a lot of free cash flow. And at this point in time, we can't deploy as much cash as we're actually generating, Sandile. Next question from Myles Fourie. Why does Karooooo regard Southeast Asia as the Group's most compelling growth opportunity in the medium to long term? And when [is the time as] (ph) Europe and Cartrack have partnered with leading OEMs in Europe? Well, we certainly believe Southeast Asia is the largest, it certainly is. In terms of the economy growth, Southeast Asia is probably one of the most fastest growing economies in the world -- in the region. It's also a huge, large addressable market. We've come in as outsiders. We're making good progress. We're starting to get good momentum. And I think we've still got a very long way to go before we reach the full TAM. And I've answered the OEMs as well. Historically, Cartrack have doubled their number of subscribers every four years. Do you see this continue at this pace or faster pace? Currently, we're growing slightly slower than we did in those years. I think when COVID came, and then the one year post-COVID, it sort of cramped our style, but we certainly are getting momentum and our intention is to grow to more than double our subscriber base in less than four years. So it's just a question of us getting our momentum back, which we certainly are getting it post-COVID. Alexander. Can you talk about the linearity of subscriber growth from June through to September? Did you see improvements every month or was it fairly ratable? Any change in vehicles per customer in terms of what you added this quarter? So our customer base in terms of our SMEs, large enterprise customers and consumers remains quite constant over the years. And then our growth has been quite -- it's been quite consistent on a daily basis. We really measure our growth on working days, Alex. So quite frankly, we've got very steady growth. The way we can see it, we measure that growth on a daily basis, and the more working days we have, the better we do, and we certainly are picking up momentum. Adding to that, Alex, typically, Q3 is normally our best quarter given that there's less holidays in Q3. [Al Salman] (ph). What will the financial impact of ceasing Carzuka in South Africa? What percentage is coming from refurbishing? So I think I've answered that too, Al. Andrew Ng. Do you compete with Descartes Group? Andrew, I apologize, but I do not know the Descartes Group. And then Chris Logan. Well done on [strength and momentum in sensors] (ph). You’re seeing a lot of strength in non-vehicle applications, what they call equipment monitoring. Is this an area you see sales potentially? Fundamentally, Chris, we're doing a lot of -- there's a lot of demand from our customers, well, for just IoT devices, for equipment. So it depends what you call equipment. But we've got a lot of yellow machineries, forklifts. We deal with a lot of machinery already. So when we say subscribers, some of it includes that type of equipment that's been used in warehouses. And so my answer to that is clearly, as long as it's an IoT device and we can collect raw data and push that data into our cloud and help our customers run their businesses, that's what we do. Then a final question from [indiscernible]. Carzuka will be closing down altogether? We have got the technology, so the company will remain open, but we will not be buying and selling vehicles and owning inventory. I want to thank everybody for asking -- just one more question that just came through. [indiscernible]. ARPU has been stable for quite some time. Given all the inflation around the world, what is the reason you haven't increased prices? [indiscernible] our ARPU today is the same that it was 15 years ago. And we've got great operating profit margins, EBITDA margins, great gross profit margins. We continue to grow our customer base. And quite frankly, the way we've always beaten inflation is just through economies of scale. And as we feel these expenses, clearly, we feel them over the years. And -- but we've always been able to beat them through economies of scale.\nZak Calisto: And I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and look forward to talking to you again in three months' time. Okay, bye-bye."

        "content": "Carmen Calisto: Hello, and welcome to Karooooo's Financial Year 2024 Q1 Earnings Call. On behalf of Karooooo, we would like to thank you for joining us today. I'm Carmen, the group's Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, and together with Hoeshin, our Group Chief Financial Officer, who will be taking you through our strong performance and growth. All investors are advised to read through the disclaimer. We will be reviewing all three of Karooooo's business units in today's webinar, namely Cartrack, Carzuka and Karooooo Logistics. Our mission remains to be the leading operations cloud as we persist in helping to define the future of operations. We continue to see how crucial mobility is to all operations and how our customers derive huge value from having more than just their vehicles and equipment, but entire operational workforce connected. Our innovative solutions are allowing customers to meet strict government compliance, whilst achieving more with less. Our customers are continuously tackling challenges around their operations efficiencies, including fuel, safety, maintenance, resource scheduling and more. However, they were also increasingly facing new obstacles from new government mandates to carbon footprint tracking and worker retention. These all contribute to the growing demand for our platform. Our strong track record of identifying trends and developing solutions that successfully solves customer challenges to add huge value to their daily operations is evident, and this is a strong driver for our continued strong sustainable growth. Through digital transformation and user-friendly tools, we offer invaluable support to customers in achieving compliance and navigating their day-to-day challenges, simplifying their operations and boosting their efficiencies. Karooooo operates within massive interconnected and mostly untapped global markets. Analysts estimate that operations contribute to over 40% of the global GDP, and as businesses recognize the importance of IoT data in enhancing the operations, the opportunities for us continue to expand. With operations becoming more cross-functional and new government mandates arising and being enforced, the range of problems we can address is widening alongside the need for our platform, setting the stage for substantial and long-term growth ahead. Karooooo's ownership-orientated culture is deeply entrenched in all parts of our business, being vertically integrated has not only given us deep tangible knowledge about operations, but has allowed us to control our distribution to ensure we are able to quickly adapt to our customers' growing needs. This, alongside our continuous investment in our proprietary internal solutions has fostered a customer-centric culture that focuses on providing world-class customer service. We have a strong history of building scalable software that solves complex problems across different disciplines and customers quickly understand their large return of investment from our platform. Through an ecosystem of open APIs, our platform enables customers to connect with other tools to bring all their operational data into a single unified cloud where they receive actionable insights that drive huge impact. Karooooo's constant innovation, customer centricity and ownership-orientated culture has enabled us to develop a platform that benefits from long-term stickiness as shown by our 95% customer retention rate and is easily implemented in small to large enterprises across a range of diverse industries. At the core of our success is the ability to set ourselves apart through strong execution. Our forward-looking approach delivers high ROI to customers and enables us to build a sustainable business that will benefit stakeholders for generations to come. We have unique go-to-market strategies, strong distribution channels and place full focus on providing a great customer experience on our end-to-end operations cloud. We have a vertically integrated business model, proprietary internal management systems and a strong entrepreneurial culture. These all come together to allow us to challenge the status quo to successfully solve problems and provide customers with a platform they can rely on as the backbone of their operations. This is highlighted by our increase in commercial customers to over 108,000. We continue to see no industry or customer concentration risk. Digitalization, ESG and compliance continue to drive increased demand and adoption of our platform across all geographies. Operators create visibility and are looking to leverage the power of IoT to gain full control over their operations. End customers and governments are increasingly focusing on net zero and putting significant pressure on our customers to reduce their carbon emissions and increase their positive impact on the community. And finally, we have seen large strides by governments to increase compliance across geographies, both in terms of new laws as well as enforcement. These are no longer negotiables. Our approach to ESG successfully solves all government mandates, whilst also ensuring customers drive strong operational value from their ESG initiatives. Reducing carbon emissions by cutting fuel is clear. However, our platform goes beyond to ensure customers are also focusing on other aspects of their operations, such as maintenance plans to reduce their maintenance costs and in turn slash their emissions. Tracking emissions in a simple-to-digest format that contextualizes data has enabled customers to embark on government's efforts to reduce emissions more easily. As previously mentioned, governments are increasingly implementing sophisticated mandates that are spreading to all aspects of an operation from driver shifts to regulatory paperwork and machinery inspections. Customers rely on our easy-to-use digital tools to digitalize their operations and ensure compliance with the latest standards. Customers are also now better equipped to tackle driver and worksite safety through gamified scorecards and AI cameras that reduce speeding and accidents and increase driver well-being and retention, as well as company brand within the community. By interconnecting their ESG and operations, we help customers meet their ESG and compliance goals, whilst cutting costs, all in all, leading to increased customer ROI and stickiness. We continue to believe that our advanced cloud platform and unrivaled service delivery position us well in Asia. The rapidly growing market remains largely underpenetrated and fragmented and small to large business operators are increasingly looking to digitalize their operations to enhance efficiencies and competitive advantage. Our strong growth in this segment is testament to our ability to localize our solutions and adapt to different customer cultures and needs, whilst ensuring they remain reliable, effective and easy to use. Our solutions are robust and built for scale. There are a large number of companies in Asia paving the way globally with their sophisticated approaches to their operations. Despite Asia's reputation for price sensitivity, customers are increasingly looking towards value for money as they continue to understand how data can revolutionize their businesses. Some customers are focusing on improving their reputation and brand through increased safety, risk management and guaranteed service delivery. Others are leading the way with electric vehicles leveraging our platform to eliminate challenges around battery life and vehicle demand hotspots. And others are powering over 10,000 daily deliveries, whilst reducing fuel costs, vehicle loading downtimes and admin. They use our sophisticated APIs to connect into their ERP and other tools to get a single unified view of their complex operation. With over 155 billion valuable data points generated monthly and over 10% of all vehicles on the road in South Africa, Karooooo has a huge untapped network effect opportunity. We continue to focus on using our scale advantages to benefit our customers through personalized experiences and advanced machine learning and insights. This remains aligned with our belief to drive sustained long-term value for customers. Our strong management, entrepreneurial culture and vertically integrated business model have empowered us to remain agile and adaptable resulting in our proven track record of growth and profitability across the varying macroeconomic headwinds across regions. We continue to offer a strong value proposition to customers by continuously adding new innovative solutions to our cloud, whilst also passing on the benefits of our economies of scale to our customers. Our ARPUs remain stable and our customer retention remains very high. We have a resilient business model that is highly cash generative with strong margins and large visibility of future revenue. Our balance sheet is robust and management continues to drive strong unit economics with sustained growth of scale. Given the large TAM and our strong principles, we have ample runway for growth. I will now pass over to Hoeshin, who will take us through our financial performance.\nGoy Hoeshin: Thank you, Carmen. I will now talk through Karooooo's financial performance for quarter one FY 2024. Please note that all comparisons are against quarter one FY 2023, unless otherwise stated. Our proven and profitable SaaS business model continue and delivered a solid start for the financial year. In Q1, Karooooo's total revenue increased by 24% to ZAR997 million, and ARR increased 20% to ZAR3,409 million. As expected, after substantial investment for future growth in all segments, operating profit increased marginally by 3% to ZAR224 million, and earnings per share increased 3% to ZAR5.09. All segments continue to see strong traction with the benefits of our strategic investment beginning to show. Our consistent results extend our track record of growth at scale, profitability and cash generation ability. Free cash flow in this quarter, up by 39% to ZAR158 million and continue to bolster our balance sheet. Net cash on hand up by 18% to ZAR1,137 million. In this quarter, ZAR32 million are invested in the development of the South African Central office and ZAR19 million are invested in the working capital of Carzuka. That does turnover days continued to show improvement to 28 days alongside with prudent provisioning to weather off strong economic headwinds in some of the markets we are operating. The healthy cash generation drove up net cash and cash equivalents and support future cash outflows required for future growth. We have strong unit economics, robust operating margins, a leveraged balance sheet and a strong cash conversion. We remain confident that our track records of success, especially our ability to generate healthy cash flow is sustainable. Our earnings per share increased by 3% to ZAR5.09 in this quarter. The increase is the result of positive revenue growth and improved profitability despite our prudent and strategic investment [focus] (ph). We will now focus on Cartrack, the underlying assets to Karooooo's success. Cartrack continue to prove its ability to scale in varying macroeconomic conditions and consistently beaten the rule of 40. Overall, subscribers grew at scale by 14% to 1,757,452. And in this quarter, subscription revenue grew 18% to ZAR834 million, and operating profit stood at ZAR232 million. As Cartrack continue with strong SaaS revenue growth, Cartrack’s total revenue grew 18% to ZAR853 million. Cartrack’s total subscription revenue represents 98% of total revenue, which is in line with our SaaS business model. We've mentioning our SaaS ARR grew 20% to ZAR3,401 million. The strong performance of Cartrack was largely supported by demand of small to large enterprise wanting to improve its compliance function and to digitally transform their business to become more efficient and competitive. As Cartrack continue to have strong visibility of its future SaaS revenue, our realization of economies of scale continue to demonstrate our ability to drive earnings. Gross profit in this quarter increased by 16% to ZAR600 million. Despite the investment for growth, our operating profit increased by 5% to ZAR232 million. In this quarter, we increased our headcount, both in sales and G&A. We are building strong support and distribution capabilities as we expand in our territories. Our adjusted EBITDA up by 10% to ZAR392 million. Cartrack's low cost of acquiring a customer, high customer lifetime value and retention rate, as well as strong benefits from economies of scale results in our leading unit economics. Our LTV to CAC is over [9] (ph). We have strong profit margins with our gross profit margin on subscription revenue at 71% and commercial customer retention rate of 95%. While we remain prudent with our capital allocation, we started our hiring drive in quarter one for territorial expansion and growth of the business. Over the years, Cartrack has maintained a steady ARPU and average upfront cost of acquiring a subscriber. ARPU for the quarter was ZAR160. Cartrack's average lifetime revenue per subscriber increased to ZAR9,604 in this quarter. The average upfront cost of adding a subscriber to our cloud in this quarter was ZAR2,363. These costs mainly relates to sales commission and telematic device, which are capitalized and sales and marketing expenses that are expensed off. The headroom derived from the average lifetime revenue per subscriber after subtracting the average upfront cost of adding a subscriber was ZAR7,241 per subscriber. From the ZAR7,241, we incur the cost to service a subscriber over the contract life cycle of 60 months. The cost to service a subscriber decreased as we grow our subscriber base. Our unit economics have remained steady, allowing a strong operating profit. Cartrack continue to grow its subscriber base and ARR to expand in all geographies. The South African economies remains under pressure as a result of continuing strain on the National Power Grid. Despite the challenging trading conditions, our subscriber grew by 13%. In Asia, the Middle East and U.S.A., subscriber grew by 24% as the traction in Southeast Asia has been encouraging. Southeast Asia remained as the second largest contributor to the group's revenue, presenting the most compelling growth opportunity to the group in medium to long term. Europe saw a healthy growth of 12% and remain a region we are focusing our resources on. With our recent partnership with leading OEMs, we are poised to leverage our extensive offerings to further develop the connected vehicle ecosystem and expect these partnerships to contribute to our results in medium term. Africa either maintained its growth with 7% increase in subscribers. At the end of quarter one, our ARR increased 20% to ZAR3,401 million. This is at a good [pending] (ph) as we continue to see the momentum of growth in our subscriber and ARR. Cartrack’s continue to have robust operating margins and our trends are in line with the long-term financial goals set up upon our listing in 2021. In this quarter, our subscription revenue gross profit margin stood at 71%, which is consistent with our expectation. Research and development expenses as a percentage of subscription revenue are 6%. With the start of our hiring drive in Q1, we prudently invest into sales and marketing headcounts to drive our territorial expansion and growth. And as a result, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of subscription revenue increase to 14%. General and admin expenses as a percentage of subscription revenue are at 21% and will continue to improve as we remain pragmatic in our operating expenses. Operating profit as a percentage of subscription revenue are 28%, and our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of subscription revenue are at 47%. We have had a solid start to our financial year 2024. Our guidance for Cartrack's outlook remains unchanged with number of subscribers between 1.9 million to 2.1 million. Cartrack's subscription revenue between ZAR3.4 billion to ZAR3.6 million and Cartrack's operating profit margin between 28% to 31%. Carzuka and Karooooo Logistics continue to gain traction and bolster Karooooo revenue growth. Both segments show good progress with strong quarter one growth. Carzuka delivered ZAR82 million in revenue in this quarter. This growth continues to support our belief in the sustainability of its agile, data enhanced and highly scalable business model. It is also a testament of Karooooo's customer-centric innovation in solving unique mobility needs. While it is at an operating loss as we carry out to invest in the infrastructure and brand building, we will also focus in refining our internal processes to improvise the efficacy and being pragmatic in our spending. We consider this an asset-light investment and once Carzuka's revenue exceed ZAR300 million per quarter, we believe the business will give us the return we expect. Karooooo Logistics delivered significant growth, generating ZAR62 million in revenue and an encouraging operating profit of ZAR5 million in this quarter. Its focus on delivery as a service has gained momentum, while we continue to integrate into Cartrack's platform to expand its customer base. The Karooooo Logistics stack is expected to deliver a long-term revenue stream to the group. I would like to thank everybody for joining us today, and we will now open the floor to Q&A with our group CEO and founder, Mr. Jose Calisto.\nJose Calisto: Thank you, Hoeshin. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I'm going to start off with a question from Matthew from William Blair. As subscriber addition trended in June and July relative to the first quarter, we certainly had a much stronger June and July compared to the first three months of the financial year. So this quarter, we are hoping to see a substantially better quarter than the previous year in terms of subscriber additions. Another question from Matthew from William Blair. Which expense lines do you anticipate to show the most leverage throughout the year, so that Cartrack's segment can meet its operating profit margin target. In the first quarter, we've spent a substantial amount of money in terms of recruiting people for support, which falls under G&A. We are continuing Q2 to also recruit and add more headcount. And I certainly believe G&A is the one that will then taper off and allow us to meet our targets. I certainly believe we are on track, and we're going in accordance with budgets and to meet our targets. And the next question from Parker Lane. How should we think about the balance of growth and profitability over the medium to long term as Carzuka and Karooooo Logistics continue to scout? Parker, I think one needs to see these three different segments in isolation. They've got very different margins. And as they've got different margins on the consolidated numbers, that's going to affect our margins, but I see Carzuka reaching breakeven in the short term. And I certainly see Karooooo logistics that is already profitable, continue to scale that. But I think for a very long time to come Cartrack will certainly be the driving force of our operating profits. The next question, I'm going to Matthew from Conference Impact Fund. Two areas, I would like to understand better, the change in capitalization of costs and the result in lower reported EBITDA, what were the nature of these costs? And -- so maybe it needs a bit of clarity. There is no change in the way we capitalize costs. That is something that's not discretionary. That's something by IFRS. What has changed is that, what we've seen is a huge increase in marketing costs, and those marketing costs are expensed upfront. And with those being expensed upfront, obviously, affect our operating profit. But as [indiscernible] through the unit economics, you can also see the higher ARPU and we will drive more value out of each subscriber and it will offset that initial cost that we do have upfront that is affecting us. So we'll reap the benefits going into the future. And is there a better way that we can better understand comparable reporting for historical periods? The only way we can do that is by either cash accounting. And in terms of cash accounting, what we see is that, our breakeven of the cost that we incur upfront has remained fairly constant. I haven't got the exact number on mind, but I think it's around 22 or 23 months. So despite the total costs going up, given the ARPU and given the lower costs to service each vehicle and a client every month, we have a breakeven point that's remained fairly constant historically. Then Asian growth also from Mathew from Conference Impact Fund, which markets are responsible for the growth in Asia? Clearly, we're gaining strong momentum in Singapore and we are certainly the market leaders in Singapore. And we're getting really good momentum in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand at this stage. How is the sales marketing setup there? We've got the same setup throughout all the geographies that we operate in. Are you happy that you will be able to sustain 20% growth in this geography? Well, we certainly believe 20% to be a very low growth in Asia. And clearly, with COVID, that was very difficult. I think the year post-COVID was difficult, but for different reasons. I think the job market was quite difficult. I think we're now starting to get the momentum that we need. And I certainly believe we will go -- we will grow much faster than we currently are. And certainly, it's marketing and also the team's opinion that will grow faster than we're currently growing. Then we'll go to Sebastian. Can you comment further on higher proportion of [indiscernible] that was expensed during this quarter? And what [changed[ (ph) this figure? Is this due to customers canceling? So what drives the figure, it's really what does it cost us to put the [indiscernible] cloud. This -- and I might be being a bit repetitive here, but I will do it for the sake of clarity. The portion of those costs, we actually expense upfront, which is the sales, salaries and the marketing costs and the other costs we capitalized, which is the IoT devices and the technicians and the commissions paid. This is our IFRS rules, how to do the accounting for it? And is this due to customers' canceling? It's got absolutely nothing to do with customer’s canceling? What customer’s canceling will do, it will reduce your customer retention, and it will also reduce your life cycle of the vehicle on your cloud. And we've consistently been at over 16 months. And this is obviously an actuarial calculation. The next one from Alexandra Scholar. Southeast Asia growth continue well above the company average. How much go-to-market investment are you putting in behind the current momentum in the regions? Clearly, our biggest capital allocation continues still to be South Africa. But obviously, as a proportion, that's decreasing. And Southeast Asia is clearly increasing substantially. So what we did see is a huge increase in that in Q1 this year. [indiscernible] historical been a focus, but what are your latest thoughts around pricing and the ability to push pricing as a growth driver? Our pricing model is very much around our unit economics and while we're getting operating profits in the region of 30%, in terms of our P&L we believe there is no need to drive up pricing at this stage. We are getting great benefits from the economies of scale. But our ability to drive our pricing, we did test it last year. And we believe should it be necessary that we certainly got a lot of elasticity to push up pricing, given that we're continuously adding stack to our platform. And if one had to take the route that every time you put on a new stack or enhance the stack that you can grow the market and upsell, I believe we can do that, should it be necessary. Next question from [indiscernible]. You are evidently spending for future growth, for example, the hiring drive, how many months does it take before the spin starts translating into revenue growth? It's typically, I would say, it's about six months. And the real effects of investment, what I've learned is, you invest and the real benefits actually comes two or three years later. Normally, what you find is, when you bring on staff, it takes them about six months to settle. And they really most staff only start adding real value after they've been with us for about 24 months. So -- but you do start seeing value after six months. Next question from [indiscernible]. With the low base in Asia and Europe, should we not expect higher growth rate than what the firm was delivered currently? I certainly believe so. And I certainly believe that we are going to be driving that. Our commitment now is to really start growing Asia and Europe faster. A question from [indiscernible]. The number of net additions in subscribers slowed down to 25,000 in South Africa for this quarter and last quarter. What are the reasons for this? [indiscernible], South Africa at the moment has got quite a few challenges. South Africa is quite a resilient country. It every so often goes through these challenges. And one of the biggest challenges we've got now is the stress on the electricity grid. And obviously, that's been quite a negative effect on the economy as a whole. Next question from [indiscernible] from [indiscernible]. How did you manage to grow subs in South Africa? Is it increased market share or higher industry penetration? We don't have the full market statistics to be able to answer you with the level of -- degree of confidence that I would like. But I believe it's a combination of market share and higher industry penetration. Next question, Prashant [indiscernible]. Can you please provide some context on ESG carbon footprint monetary being a driver for growth? What are some of the specific government regulations driving adoption and which geographies? So there's a lot of talk about ESG. There's a lot of very positive movements in that direction. And what we are seeing is, government legislation starting to come through in many geographies for compliance. One good example is, Europe is now bringing in e-tackle graph, which also is going to be used in sedan vehicles that are used for companies. So we're looking to get real benefit out of that. But it's really going to pay, I certainly believe, ESG, we're very well positioned to help corporate report on the compliance on the -- on many of the ESG aspects. And we certainly believe that's going to become a stronger and stronger drive for our growth. So Chris, his question is Samsung are making much out of utilizing artificial intelligence to improve safety and efficiency and the general AI innovation, this is an area that sees potential in. Chris, I think the word artificial intelligence is the word of the day today. Everybody is using it. I think artificial intelligence has been with us for about 20 years. But certainly in the last three to four years, we've seen a huge exponential growth in the maths behind it. We've been doing it for many years. And if you look at our platform and our offering, it will be quite evident that we are driving the benefits that come from good algorithms and good data collection, good data presentation in the facility. And that's fundamentally what artificial intelligence is. So it really is just a buzzword that's, at the moment, being used very loosely. And I certainly believe, we are very much involved in delivering artificial intelligence and continue to improve on that aspect of our business. Then I've got a question from [indiscernible]. Is subscription growth outside Africa, taking longer and cost them more than anticipated since COVID-19? It's certainly taking longer but costing more, I don't think that's necessarily the case. But outside Africa what we did see specifically is a year, the last FY 2023 very turbulent, very difficult to hire people. That's starting to normalize in Q1 and in Q2. And we certainly believe that once we get the necessary momentum with the hiring, then we'll reach the results in the revenue growth. The next question from for [indiscernible]. How is trading going outside the African Q2 off a low base relative to TAMs? As I said earlier, I do -- we are having a stronger Q2. What are the inhibitors to doubling subscribers? And the reality of that is yes, the ability to distribute, and we are very much focused on increasing our distribution capabilities. Another question from [Miles] (ph). What EBITDA percentage of cars you can achieve on a quarterly revenue of ZAR300 million? We're looking that once we get to ZAR300 million, we'll probably be sitting on an operating profit of around 4% to 5%. I want to thank everybody for joining us. Thank you, and I look forward to talking to you in approximately 90 days' time.\nEnd of Q&A:"
