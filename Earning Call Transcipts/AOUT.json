At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Liz Sharp, Vice President of Investor Relations, for some information about today's call. Liz?\nLiz Sharp: Thank you, and good afternoon. Our comments today may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. Our use of words like anticipate, project, estimate, expect, intend, should, could, indicate, suggest, believe and other similar expressions is intended to identify those forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also include statements regarding our product development, focus, objectives, strategies and vision, our strategic evolution, our market share and market demand for our products, market and inventory conditions related to our products and in our industry in general, and growth opportunities and trends. Our forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about the future, and they are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Risk factors and other considerations that could cause our actual results to be materially different are described in our securities filings. You can find those documents, as well as a replay of this call on our website at aob.com. Today's call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of this time, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from our statements today. I have a few important items to note about our comments on today's call. First, we reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP results exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock compensation, shareholder cooperation agreement costs, facility consolidation costs, technology implementation, acquisition costs, other costs and income tax adjustments. The reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures, whether they are discussed on today's call, can be found in our filings, as well as today's earnings press release, which are posted on our website. Also, when we reference EPS, we are always referencing fully-diluted EPS. Joining us on today's call is Brian Murphy, President and CEO and Andy Fulmer, CFO. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Murphy: Thanks, Liz, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We delivered a solid third quarter, and I'm very pleased with our results, which included top line sales growth, disciplined capital management and the unveiling of several strategically important product introductions that we believe expand our brands' runway for growth. I believe our results demonstrate our ability to remain focused on our long-term strategy, while successfully navigating the near-term environment. Our third quarter sales reflect a growth of more than 23% over our pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2020, including our acquisition of Grilla Grills in fiscal 2022. For the third quarter, we delivered net sales growth of 5%, a result that came in ahead of our expectations and was supported by our diverse portfolio, evidenced by stronger sales across a number of brands within our Shooting Sports and Outdoor Lifestyle categories, which both delivered net sales growth. In addition, our e-commerce and traditional channels experienced net sales growth in the quarter. In our Outdoor Lifestyle category, which consists of products related to hunting, fishing, camping, outdoor cooking and rugged outdoor activities, we delivered third quarter year-over-year growth of 2.8%. That growth was led by strength in our hunting and fishing-related products and reflected the success of our strategy to identify incremental retail opportunities, including the expansion of our MEAT! Your Maker meat processing equipment into the retail channel last quarter. On a long-term basis, our Outdoor Lifestyle category has grown more than 43% compared to the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2020, including the Grilla acquisition. I believe this result reflects the success of our strategy to grow this part of our business. In fact, our Outdoor Lifestyle category comprised over 54% of our total net sales in the third quarter. Turning now to our Shooting Sports category, which includes solutions for target shooting, aiming, safe storage, cleaning and maintenance, and personal protection. We delivered growth of 7.6% compared to the prior year. This result was led by our ability to clear some slower moving inventory in the personal protection category, combined with stronger sales in shooting accessories. We are especially pleased with this result, given reports from firearm manufacturers in the quarter that continued to cite reduced consumer demand. With regard to channel sales in the third quarter, we delivered sales growth in both our traditional and e-commerce channels, reflecting our strategy to ensure that our brands meet the consumer wherever they shop. We also delivered sales growth in our domestic and international channels, reflecting our strategy to expand into international markets. In fact, our international sales grew by over 72% in the quarter, the result of introducing more of our lifestyle brands to the Canadian market. With regard to sell-through, we gather point-of-sale and channel inventory data from retailers that represent about half of our sales. We were pleased with our POS results this quarter. POS sales increased for both our Outdoor Lifestyle and Shooting Sports categories. Now, turning to innovation, which is core to our long-term growth strategy. Our ability to innovate allows us to drive growth by entering new product categories, and it's driven by our Dock and Unlock process. Our approach often consists of creating a new product with proprietary IP and using that product to establish a beachhead for a given brand. From there, we fan out, developing incremental products that allow us to enter new product categories and move from that single point of entry to a full family of products that build upon the brand's familiarity and its loyal following. We've proven the success of this approach in the past with our BUBBA brand, moving from a single manual fillet knife to a full family of fishing products that now includes our BUBBA Pro Series Smart Fish Scale, which was rapidly adopted and is now the official scale for Major League Fishing. In the third quarter, we again demonstrated the success of this approach by unveiling a number of innovative and internally developed new products under our Caldwell, Grilla and Hooyman brands. I believe these products represent the tip of the iceberg as we execute against a robust new product pipeline that extends well into the next 5 years, providing us with a long-term competitive advantage, and uniquely positioning our brands to expand market share, enter new product categories and markets, and broaden our distribution channels. Now, let me share some of the exciting product details. In a sea of electric clay throwers, most powered by wires connected to a 40-pound car battery, Caldwell caught the attention of clay shooters last year when we introduced the world's first battery-free, foot-operated clay thrower with a stackable clay hopper called the Claymore. It has been very successful, to say the least. When developing the Claymore, we also stumbled upon a gap in the marketplace. There were few product offerings available between the two main types of clay throwers. Handheld, which are generally entry-level and lower priced and stationary clay throwers, which tend to be much more expensive. Our solution, the Caldwell Claymore Solo which leverages the same battery-free mechanics of the original Claymore, but loads and throws one clay at a time instead of being stack fed. Because of this, it's remarkably light at just 15 pounds, half the weight of the original Claymore, and competitively priced, filling a gap with innovation and extreme value. But we didn't stop there. We looked at the clay thrower market and wondered why consumers had to compromise throwing distance when choosing between a handheld thrower and a stationary one. We also recognized the benefit of being able to change the angle of the target with a handheld thrower. However, most like the ability to securely hold a clay in place when tilting the thrower before release. We solved both of these problems with the Caldwell Claymore PullPup. Our new handheld thrower can easily launch clay targets over 55 yards, while our dual grip design, combined with a unique holding clip, enables users to easily launch targets off camber at a variety of angles. Next, we saw an opportunity for our new Grilla brand to fulfill its promise to help consumers evolve their backyard. One of the benefits of owning a brand that's entirely direct to consumer is the closer connection it brings to the actual user, including product ideas. Grilla consumers expressed frustration with the vertical smoker offerings from competitors. Feedback included lack of space, limited meat rack and hanging options, poor smoke generation, and few options to control and monitor cooking. We've solved all of those problems with the new Mammoth vertical smoker, which features over 1,600 square inches of smoking space, accommodates up to 10 racks and 24 hangers, puts out a generous amount of smoke using our proprietary lift heat deflector, and utilizes our new Alpha Connect 2.0 controller to control and monitor cooking. The Mammoth absolutely hit the mark, and we continue to sell out each new container of Mammoth vertical smokers as they arrive, demonstrating the powerful nature of Grilla's connection with the consumer. Lastly, as our Hooyman brand has expanded into land management products, we've identified several categories riddled with consumer pain points ripe for innovation. One such area is seed spreaders; seed can be very expensive. And if you need to cover a large area, two considerations stand out, speed and precision. After releasing our first seed spreader last year, the Hooyman chest-mounted spreader, we turned our attention to high-capacity spreaders. These are commonly mounted to vehicles, including ATVs. We discovered that in addition to speed and precision, users had to overcome two additional pain points with vehicle-mounted spreaders. One, an overly cumbersome attachment process, and two, frustration from seed spilling from the hopper anytime precision and distance adjustments were made. Our new 125-pound capacity Hooyman vehicle spreaders solved all of these problems, enabling the user to attach our spreader in under 60 seconds and adjust the spreader's accuracy without compromising valuable seed. With these products in hand, we attended SHOT Show in January, an annual industry event that is generally focused on new shooting-related products. Our Caldwell brand is always popular at SHOT, and the new Claymore products were extremely well received. And while attendees weren't surprised to see Caldwell at the show, they were surprised and very interested to see a full Grilla outdoor kitchen setup, the new Mammoth smoker, our MEAT! Your Maker meat processing equipment, and our Hooyman product lineup, all of which were brand-new to SHOT, and the reception was tremendous. But most importantly, we were able to expose these brands to an entirely new audience, retailers and adjacent distribution channels. Increased and expanded distribution channel opportunities are one of our four growth avenues that comprise our long-term strategic plan, and they are particularly strategic given the current retail environment. As we've said on prior calls, the surge in consumer buying during the pandemic allowed retailers in our industry to become less selective when stocking their shelves. But today's consumer is more discerning, and retailers have shifted towards careful inventory management, seeking out compelling products that consumers truly want. At AOB, we believe that by introducing a steady stream of innovative solutions backed by enthusiast brands, we can capture market share, gain new placement and expand shelf space with retailers looking to draw on the consumer. With that, I'll turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial results.\nAndy Fulmer: Thanks, Brian. Our third quarter results included growing our net sales over last year, strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders, all while navigating the environment of consumer uncertainty and cautious retailer behavior that have marked the last few quarters. Let me walk you through the details. Net sales for Q3 of $53.4 million increased 5% over Q3 last year. These results were slightly ahead of our expectations by about $2.5 million, as certain orders we had originally expected in Q4 occurred in Q3. Compared to pre-pandemic Q3 of fiscal 2020, net sales increased by 23.3%, including the acquisition of Grilla. On a category basis, we saw growth in both Outdoor Lifestyle and Shooting Sports net sales. Compared to Q3 last year, Outdoor Lifestyle grew almost 3%, driven by fishing and hunting products, and Shooting Sports grew by almost 8%, driven by increases in both personal protection and shooting accessories. Compared to pre-pandemic Q3 of fiscal 2020, the Outdoor Lifestyle category grew by 43.1%, as Brian mentioned, and Shooting Sports grew by almost 6%. On a channel basis, traditional net sales increased by 8.1% and e-commerce increased by 1.6% compared to Q3 last year. As a reminder, our e-commerce channel includes direct-to-consumer sales from our own websites, as well as sales by online retailers that do not have brick-and-mortar stores. Direct-to-consumer sales in Q3 were up over the prior year, led by very strong Black Friday weekend sales of MEAT! and Grilla, as we outlined on our last call that strength was somewhat offset by lower sales to online retailers. Turning now to gross margin, as we discussed on our last call, inventory purchases in the first half of fiscal 2024 were higher than purchases in the first half of fiscal 2023, a period when we were actively driving down inventory levels in order to strengthen our balance sheet. The higher level of purchasing in Q1 and Q2 this year drove higher tariff and freight variances, which then must be amortized over inventory turns roughly 6 months later. That increased amortization, combined with a slightly higher level of promotional activity yielded gross margin for the third quarter of 42.7% compared to 47.1% in the third quarter last year. Turning to operating expenses, GAAP operating expenses for the quarter decreased $1.3 million to $25.7 million. The decrease was driven mainly by reduced G&A, resulting from lower insurance and IT costs and lower rent expense due to facility consolidations we completed last year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased in Q3 to $21.5 million compared to $22 million in Q3 of last year for the reasons I just outlined. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude intangible amortization, stock compensation and certain non-recurring expenses as they occur. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.23 for the third quarter compared to a loss of $0.21 in Q3 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.08 in Q3 this year compared to $0.13 in the prior year. Our Q3 figures are based on our fully diluted share count of approximately 12.9 million shares. For full fiscal 2024, we expect our fully diluted share count will be about 13.3 million shares. Adjusted EBITDAS for the quarter was $2.4 million compared to $3.3 million last year. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, positive cash flow in the third quarter helped us continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash of $15.9 million and no debt after repurchasing approximately $1.8 million of our common stock. On prior calls, we've outlined that the seasonal nature of our business typically results in operating cash outflow in the first half of the year when we experience increases in accounts receivable and inventory. This is typically followed by positive cash inflow in the second half of the year as we collect those receivables and lower our inventory levels. This pattern is playing out as expected in fiscal 2024. We generated $13 million of operating cash in Q3, and we expect to generate cash in Q4. Operating cash inflow in Q3 was mainly driven by a decrease in accounts receivable of $13.2 million and a decrease of inventory of $9.1 million, netted by a decrease in accounts payable of $8.4 million. The team did an excellent job lowering our inventory levels more quickly than expected, and therefore, we expect inventories to be roughly flat from Q3 to Q4. Our balance sheet remains debt free. We ended the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $75 million expandable line of credit, and we now have total available capital of roughly $106 million. With regard to capital expenditures, we spent $3.7 million on CapEx in the third quarter. Roughly $2.9 million of this spending was from a planned one-time purchase of assets relating to the full lease assumption of our Columbia, Missouri headquarters. We have lowered our planned CapEx spending for the full year by $500,000, and we now expect total CapEx spend for fiscal 2024 to be between $6 million and $6.5 million, of which approximately $3 million to $3.5 million is recurring. Finally, a key capital allocation priority for our company is returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In Q3, we repurchased roughly 210,000 shares for $1.8 million at an average price of $8.50 per share. At the end of Q3, we had $7.8 million of availability remaining on our $10 million share repurchase program through September 2024. Now, turning to our outlook, our net sales outlook remains unchanged, and we continue to believe that fiscal 2024 could deliver full year net sales growth of up to 3.5%. Turning to gross margins, we expect to see gross margins come in at approximately 44% on a full fiscal 2024 basis, which would imply a decline in Q4 gross margins from last year. This expected decline is due to the higher tariff and freight cost amortization that I discussed earlier. With regard to OpEx, we continue to believe that overall operating expenses will decline slightly on a GAAP basis for fiscal 2024 as a result of reductions from facility consolidations, lower one-time legal and advisory fees, and lower IT implementation costs, offset by higher selling and distribution costs. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect that OpEx will increase slightly, mainly due to the higher selling and distribution costs. And recall here that we have SHOT Show in our third quarter, which adds selling and marketing costs in Q3 that don't occur in Q4. Based on these factors, we expect our adjusted EBITDAS margin for the full fiscal 2024 to be between 4.5% and 5%. Brian?\nBrian Murphy: Thank you, Andy. I believe our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to manage the elements within our control, delivering growth, innovation and a loyal customer base for our popular brands, while prudently managing our capital to allow us to invest in our long-term growth. We have a great portfolio of authentic lifestyle brands and a growing lineup of exciting and innovative products that continue to resonate with enthusiasts who are passionate about their outdoor activities. With that, operator, please open the call for questions from our analysts.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mark Smith with Lake Street Capital Markets.\nAaron Wright: This is Aaron on the line for Mark. Congrats on the quarter. So I guess to start, kind of just wondering if you can kind of unpack the inventory levels at retailers a little bit. I know you had some commentary in the prepared remarks there. But have you seen any improvement since last quarter? And I'm also just kind of curious just on your general level of confidence that you guys are going to see some progress there moving forward here.\nBrian Murphy: Yes. Was it Aaron?\nAaron Wright: Correct. Yes.\nBrian Murphy: Okay. Aaron, this is Brian. So, yes, we said, look, POS was up in the quarter. We didn't give any insight into inventory. Inventory was down in the channel, which is up a little bit in Outdoor Lifestyle because of part of the MEAT! load-in and the work with Academy. But excluding that, on both sides of the fence, Outdoor Lifestyle and Shooting Sports, inventory was down. So that's positive. And then, I'd say just some context or color, like we said, we were at SHOT Show in Vegas, and we meet with a lot of our big retailers. Inventory destocking just was not a top priority there. So we're mostly focused on getting into a normal cadence. Looking forward to the next year, the big theme that we took away was innovation, which obviously is where we play. That's one of our strengths. So less of a factor, and I think we're seeing great pull-through at retail right now.\nAaron Wright: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for that color. And then, in previous quarters, you've sort of remained focused on growing organically through your innovation efforts. And I guess R&D has been sort of at a comfortable level for you guys. So does your confidence with internal innovation efforts, I'm just curious, does it affect your appetite on the M&A markets to any degree?\nBrian Murphy: Yes. This is Brian. It's a really good question. I think one of the things that most probably don't have as much insight into is, we talked about where we have permission to play, where our brands have permission to play. And that permission to play for our brands is what ultimately informs, I'd say, we have a 5-year growth plan of new products going forward. That's based on that permission to play. So when we look at acquisitions, we say, where don't our brands have permission to play? Or where can we augment maybe some of those plans? A good example of that would be with Grilla, right? One of the reasons we went up to Grilla, in addition to being a great direct-to-consumer brand and it has this differentiation with modular kitchens, is we were actually wanting to go into outdoor cooking with MEAT! Your Maker. And the more we went down that road and talking with consumers, we just felt like it wasn't the right fit. And so, that's what helped give us the conviction to go after Grilla was that we could take some of those innovations that we had developed, and we call it, putting it in the vault. We could take them out of the vault and then use them for some of those brands that we go acquire. So it's really where don't our brands have permission to play but we do as a company? And then, in some cases, where can we actually augment some of the innovation that we've already developed but may not have the right brand for, so that's really how we look at it and really helps inform our acquisitions.\nAaron Wright: Great. Yes. Totally understandable. Thanks for all that color, and again, congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Koranda with ROTH MKM.\nMike Zabran: It's Mike Zabran on for Matt. Maybe just starting on the sales guide, it implies a low-single-digit growth rate in the fourth quarter, somewhere a bit below the third quarter growth. Any reason to expect the deceleration in growth in the fourth quarter¸ or are we more so just being conservative, given the continued caution from retailers?\nAndy Fulmer: Mike, this is Andy. It's a great question. I would attribute it more to just the cyclical quarter-by-quarter seasonal nature of our business. So typically, Q2, Q3 are higher, Q4 is a little bit lower. So I wouldn't really put any more emphasis on that.\nMike Zabran: Got it. Okay. And maybe on channel inventory, you kind of talked about it earlier, but maybe just speak to what we're seeing in regards to sell-in versus sell-through at retail. And then, are there any areas where we see opportunity for higher load-in benefit looking ahead?\nBrian Murphy: Sure. This is Brian. So yes, I think going back, gosh, two-plus years. We talked about, ultimately what we want to have is the closest link possible between sell-in and sell-through. We don't want to be have too much of our product in the channel. We want there to be as much of a tight link as possible so that when we see our POS data, it allows all of our internal teams, inventory management teams, our S&OP process to be able to order the right product and not have too much of it and get it here at the right time. So we feel like that, that link is pretty strong right now. We're not seeing a whole lot of slack in the system at least with our company. And then, I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?\nMike Zabran: Just any areas where we see opportunity for higher load-in ahead? We talked about it happening a little bit in this quarter.\nBrian Murphy: Yes. So replens are, we're seeing great replenishment right now. And then, we've got new products that are always coming out. We've got some new products that are going to be hitting at the end of April and shipping to stores, so we'll see some benefit there. That should include some load-ins. And then, we haven't talked about next year yet, but certainly our conversations with retailers, line reviews that we had last fall that went very, very well, should go well for us and see some load-ins for those new products next year. In addition to new distribution, we've got some new retailers coming online that we're very excited about.\nMike Zabran: Got it. That's great to hear. Last one for me. We talked about balancing internal innovation versus M&A earlier in the Q&A. But maybe just speak to, I guess, your appetite to be acquisitive in the near term, maybe. The balance sheet looks great but just any changes on this front. Have we seen anything interesting, any developments there?\nBrian Murphy: Yes. It's Brian again. And Andy, feel free to chime in. So generally, in terms of our philosophy, we tend to be a little bit more cautious when we see multiples go way up and the market becomes more frothy. We did Grilla over the last few years, but it was very selective and very targeted. And now, we're seeing sort of the M&A market has come down, slowed down a little bit. We're seeing signs of it beginning to pick back up; we're seeing a few more decks from banks with sell-side deals. And we couldn't be in a better position. Like you alluded to, we're in a great cash position. We have dry powder. We have no debt and so, we're on the hunt. We are actively looking, meeting with companies directly or through advisers. But we've got a great pipeline that we're executing against and you never know when one is going to hit. But we've got a very clear perspective on who it is that we need to go after, and we're executing on that.\nMike Zabran: Got it. That's off from me guys. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian Murphy for closing remarks.\nBrian Murphy: Thank you, operator. Before we close, I want to let everyone know that we'll be participating in the ROTH Conference in California on March 18 and 19 and hope to see some of you there. I want to also thank our employees for their dedication and our shareholders for their support. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Murphy: Thanks, Liz, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased with our second quarter results, which demonstrated solid performance in sales and capital management, as well as ongoing progress in support of our long-term strategic objectives. We delivered net sales growth of 6.4%, a result that came in ahead of our expectations and that we view favorably, given that retailers continue to remain cautious about their inventories and available open to buy dollars in the quarter. Our second quarter sales also reflected long-term growth of more than 21% over our pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020, including our acquisition of Grilla Grills in fiscal 2022. We delivered year-over-year growth of more than 14% in our outdoor lifestyle category, which consists of products related to hunting, fishing, camping, outdoor cooking, and rugged outdoor activities. On a long-term basis, our outdoor category has grown nearly 40% compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020, including the Grilla acquisition. I believe this result reflects the success of our strategy to grow this part of our business. In fact, our outdoor lifestyle category comprised nearly 60% of our total sales in the second quarter. Growth in our outdoor lifestyle category also reflects our strategy to seek out and place our brands where consumers expect to find them, whether online or in-store, as well as our strategy to drive sales through retail expansion opportunities. Accordingly, we were proud to join forces with Academy Sports and Outdoors in the second quarter to bring Academy customers a select lineup of our MEAT! Your Maker meat processing equipment. Beginning in October, select MEAT products became available at all 270 Academy of retail locations and online. We originally launched MEAT in 2019 as a new, exclusively direct-to-consumer brand. Leveraging our Harvester Brand Lane teams existing infrastructure and consumer insights, MEAT quickly developed a loyal following of consumers who appreciate its premium, professional grade equipment quality, its commitment to user education, its industry leading lifetime warranty, and its authentic personality. Academy is an ideal partner for our initial entry of MEAT into brick-and-mortar stores, providing us with a great opportunity to introduce this exciting product lineup to a large number of new potential customers. Our shooting sports category saw a slight decline in second quarter net sales compared to the prior year, a result that is consistent with reports from firearm manufacturers citing ongoing heightened channel inventory and reduced consumer demand. Although, we don't produce firearms or ammunition, related products in our shooting sports category, include solutions for target shooting, aiming, safe storage, cleaning and maintenance, and self-defense. Turning now to channel sales in the second quarter. Sales growth in our traditional channel was strong, led by the initial shipments related to the MEAT launch I just discussed, and supported by strength in the hunting and fishing categories under our BOG and BUBBA brands. Net Sales in our e-commerce channel also increased year-over-year, driven primarily by sales for our largest online retailer. While promotions with that retailer in the shooting sports category came in higher than we originally anticipated, they were beneficial for two reasons. First, they helped deliver several of our brands into the hands of consumers in this otherwise uncertain consumer environment. And second, they helped to lower channel inventories of our shooting sports products as well. With regard to sell-through, we gather point-of-sale and channel inventory data from retailers that represent about half of our sales. This quarter's POS data was slightly down overall. Outdoor lifestyle was relatively flat, a result we were pleased with given the current environment. Our shooting sports category posted a year-over-year decline that was driven almost entirely by drop-in aiming solutions, which are primarily the sights and optics that attach to firearms. Sales of those products tend to follow adjusted NICS (ph) data more closely. The balance of sales in the shooting sports category performed well relative to the underlying channel trends for the category. POS data also indicates that channel inventory of our products declined slightly in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, with a decline in the shooting sports category, partially offset by an increase in the outdoor lifestyle category, consistent with my earlier comments. Before I close out the sales discussion, I want to turn quickly to preliminary Black Friday weekend sales results. And these are direct-to-consumer sales for our Grilla and MEAT products. For the four-day period from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, on a combined basis, Grilla and Meat delivered nearly 40% year-over-year growth. Grilla had its largest single sales day ever on Black Friday, and MEAT had its largest single sales day ever on Cyber Monday. Again, preliminary, but pretty exciting results. Now turning to Innovation. Innovation is core to who we are and a key element in our long-term growth strategy. We are reshaping enthusiast's expectations of what it means to deliver in the moments that matter, whether it's gamifying fishing with BUBBA's new Smart Fish Scale, defining hunting rest stability with BOG's Deathgrip line, or re-envisioning clay throwers that operate battery free with Caldwell's Claymore line. As we court consumers who are increasingly discerning, we believe that by introducing a consistent stream of Innovative solutions backed by enthusiast brands, we're able to capture market share and gain new placement. This innovation engine fueled by our Dock & Unlock process generated over 25% of our second quarter net sales. While this time of year is typically quiet for us with regard to new product introductions. Our teams are hard at work on a number of new products and extensions that will begin unveiling across several of our Shooting Sports brands at the upcoming SHOT Show in January. In addition, we're putting the finishing touches on launch plans for a very exciting new product from Grilla, you will hear about soon. We have introduced several Grilla products and accessories since the acquisition. This upcoming launch represents the first in a lineup of significant new Grilla innovations generated by our Dock & Unlock process. We've also ported Grilla over to our salesforce e-commerce platform and launched a brand new website. Visit us at grillagrills.com, check out our new Evolve Your Backyard campaign, and then stay tuned for a number of new Grilla products for launch under this campaign in the coming quarters. Lastly, we were honored to receive recognition for our innovative achievements when we were recently named Accessory Manufacturer of the Year by the National Association of Sporting Goods Wholesalers. Our Caldwell brand took home honors as well for Best New Accessory. These awards are a testament to our creative teams under Caldwell and throughout AOB, whose teamwork and talent are at the very core of our success. With that, I'll turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial results.\nAndrew Fulmer: Thanks, Brian. As Brian mentioned, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter. We delivered net sales growth, we maintained a strong balance sheet, and we continued to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program, all while continuing to navigate market challenges stemming from cautious inventory management by retailers and reduced consumer demand. Let me walk you through the details. Net sales for Q2 came in above our expectations at $57.9 million compared to $54.4 million in Q2 last year, an increase of 6.4%. Compared to pre-pandemic Q2 of fiscal 2020, net sales increased by 21.3%, including the acquisition of Grilla. On a category basis, net sales and outdoor lifestyle increased by 14.3% over Q2 last year and included continued strength in our hunting and rugged outdoor products. Conversely, net sales and shooting sports decreased by 3.4% compared to Q2 last year, a result that was an entirely driven by a decline in aiming solution products, which are sold to both firearm OEMs and consumers, and the sales of which tend to align more closely with adjusted NICs (ph). On a channel basis, traditional sales, which included our retail launch of MEAT! Your Maker products, increased by 8.7%, while e-commerce net sales increased by 3.3% over Q2 last year. As a reminder, our e-commerce channel includes direct-to-consumer sales from our own websites, as well as sales by online retailers that do not have brick-and-mortar stores. Turning to gross margin. Gross margin for Q2 decreased to 45.7% compared to 47.7% in Q2 last year. The decrease was mainly due to increased promotional activity in the current year that Brian mentioned. Although, this promotional level was higher than we anticipated, we believe the programs were effective in driving net sales in this uncertain market. Turning to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $26.5 million compared to $26.1 million last year. The increase was driven mainly by higher variable selling and distribution costs, relating to the net sales increase, netted by decreases in IT, insurance, and lower rent due to facility consolidations we completed last year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses in Q2 were up slightly to $22.3 million compared to $21.3 million in Q2 of last year for the reasons that I just listed. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude intangible amortization, stock compensation, and certain non-recurring expenses as they occur. GAAP EPS was $0.01 for the second quarter compared to $0.03 for the second quarter last year. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.25 in Q2 this year compared to $0.29 in the prior year. Our Q2 figures are based on our fully diluted share count of approximately 13.3 million shares. For full fiscal 2024, we expect our fully diluted share count will be about 13.5 million shares. Adjusted EBITDAS for the quarter was $5.2 million compared to $6.4 million last year. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash of $8.4 million and no debt, after repurchasing approximately $1.5 million of our common stock. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, our second quarter typically reflects operating cash outflow, which is the result of seasonal increases in both accounts receivable and inventory, and that was the case this quarter. Then in the second half of the year, we typically generate cash from operations as we collect those receivables and lower our inventory levels. We expect this pattern to hold true for our second half of fiscal 2024 as well. Operating cash outflow for the second quarter was $8.4 million, driven mainly by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $17 million. The higher level of AR resulted from the sequential net sales increase over Q1, as well as the timing of shipments, which were higher toward the end of the quarter. Our inventories grew by $4.2 million in the second quarter. The majority of that increase was driven by our decision to accelerate certain product purchases into Q2 in order to provide safety stock for a vendor change that will yield cost savings beginning in fiscal 2025. The balance of the increase resulted from the need to capitalize a higher level of tariff-related variances in the quarter driven by product mix. We expect inventory to decline sequentially from our current level in Q3 and again in Q4, resulting in inventories just below $100 million by the end of fiscal 2024. We remain debt-free, ending the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $75 million expandable line of credit and total available capital of roughly $100 million. With regard to capital expenditures, we spent a net $745,000 on CapEx for the second quarter, mainly for product tooling and patent costs as expected. Our expectations for total CapEx spend for fiscal 2024 remain unchanged at between $6 million and $7 million. Included in this range is spending of between $3 million and $4 million for product tooling and maintenance and a one-time spend of approximately $3 million to purchase assets including warehouse racking, office furniture, and other fixtures, when we assume the full lease at our Columbia, Missouri facility on January 1st. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key capital allocation priority, and the strength of our balance sheet has allowed us to return capital to shareholders opportunistically through our share repurchase program. Our prior share repurchase program expired in September, and in Q2, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program of up to $10 million, effective October 2023 through September 2024. In the second quarter, we repurchased roughly 158,000 shares for $1.5 million at an average price of $9.46 per share. Now turning to our outlook. Our brands remain strong with consumers, and we continue to believe that fiscal 2024 could deliver full year net sales growth of up to 3.5%. As I noted earlier, Q2 net sales came in ahead of our expectations, a result that benefited from retailers placing orders earlier in the season than last year. As such, we now expect Q3 to be relatively flat compared to Q3 last year, and we continue to believe Q4 will follow our typical seasonal pattern, delivering net sales that are higher than Q1 of fiscal 2024. Turning to gross margins. We expect to see gross margins come in at between 44% and 45% on a full fiscal 2024 basis, which would imply a slight decline in second half gross margins, as well as a decline in our full year adjusted EBITDAS expectations. I'll walk you through those details now. With regard to margins, first, while second quarter sales came in ahead of our expectations and we are maintaining our full year sales outlook, we are opting to invest more in promotions than we had originally planned, as we continue to pursue our share of wallet in the current uncertain consumer spending environment. Second, we are selectively discounting and converting to cash some of our slower moving inventory, primarily in shooting sports category. We believe the combination of these two initiatives will help us gain and protect market share while further building and strengthening our balance sheet. Third, inventory purchases in the first half of the year and predominantly in the second quarter represent both a higher dollar spend. as well as a mix of products that skewed towards higher tariffs, as I discussed earlier. Accounting treatment requires that the variances created by the difference between our standard costs and actual costs of purchased inventory, mostly tariffs, be amortized across the third and fourth quarters, and that will impact margins to a degree. And lastly, freight savings that we secured earlier this year are only recognized as the underlying inventory turns over, generally six months down the road. So the benefit of those cost reductions won't be fully recognized until our new fiscal year, which begins May 1st. With regard to OpEx, we believe that overall operating expenses will decline slightly on a GAAP basis for fiscal 2024 as a result of reductions from facility consolidations, one-time legal and advisory fees, and IT implementation costs offset by higher selling and distribution costs. On a non-GAAP basis, OpEx will increase slightly mainly due to the higher selling and distribution costs. And recall here that we have SHOT Show in our third quarter, which adds selling and marketing costs in Q3 that don't occur in Q4. Based on these factors, we expect our Adjusted EBITDAS margin for fiscal 2024 to be between 4% and 5.5%. As we enter fiscal 2025 in May, we expect to see the positive impacts on our Adjusted EBITDAs of the savings initiatives I've outlined in today's call. With that, I'll hand it back to Brian.\nBrian Murphy: Thank you, Andy. In closing, we're pleased with our second quarter performance. I believe our results demonstrate our ability to manage those elements within our control, delivering growth, innovation, and a loyal customer base for our popular brands, while prudently managing our capital to allow us to invest in our long-term growth. We have a number of reasons to be excited about the future. For instance, we're on track to deliver total net sales growth of up to 3.5% this fiscal year in alignment with our initial expectations. POS sales at retail for our outdoor lifestyle brands remain relatively favorable and channel inventories for our shooting sports brands are significantly lower. We have many innovative, exciting new products and development across multiple brands in shooting sports and outdoor lifestyle that will begin launching in January and will continue launching through calendar 2024 and beyond. We are extending the reach of our legacy D2C brands such as MEAT! Your Maker, with strategic retail partners. Our BUBBA brand was named the official scale of Major League Fishing earlier this year, and the new MLF season, which we believe will drive tremendous visibility for BUBBA, is set to kick off in January 2024. We have taken aggressive, preemptive actions with regard to facility consolidation and space optimization, free cost reduction, and a vendor change, all of which are designed to generate notable savings in fiscal 2025. Business consolidations are now complete, and we have the capacity and resources to grow organically and through acquisition without adding incremental costs. And lastly, the M&A landscape appears to be heating up a bit. At the same time, our balance sheet remains extremely strong and we have no debt, affording us the ability to freely explore the growing number of acquisition opportunities we see on the horizon. To cap it off, we have a broad portfolio of authentic lifestyle brands including Caldwell, Grilla, BUBBA, and others that continue to resonate with enthusiasts who are passionate about their outdoor activities. We couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead. With that, operator, please open the call for questions from our analysts.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mark Smith with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMark Smith: Hi, guys. First question for me, just wanted to dig in on adding MEAT into kind of traditional channel. Any additional insight you can give us on kind of the scale of that -- maybe a way of asking this, would you still had growth in the traditional channel without adding in those MEAT sales into Academy?\nBrian Murphy: Hey, Mark. It's Brian. The short answer is, yes. We still have an increase despite the load in with MEAT! Your Maker. And in all signs to this point are very positive. We're working with Academy to make sure that's a successful launch. Also great to see that our e-commerce sales for the four days we mentioned in our prepared remarks from Black Friday to Cyber Monday saw tremendous traction. So all signs are positive at this time, but yes, the underlying trends within traditional were also very positive.\nMark Smith: Okay. Then shooting sports is obviously still a little bit tough. I'm curious, if we can just look at October at all, any call out as we saw NICS get better. Did you see increased demand as you look at point of sale data for some of your shooting sports products, or did that not really apply with that purely more so just firearms?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. This is Brian again. So I would say that we alluded to aiming solutions, dragging down the overall sales and shooting sports and that is definitely true. Our brands like Caldwell, Tipton, Wheeler, Frankford Arsenal, actually did very well, just given the other trends going on in the industry. So very pleased to see that in particular within categories that we've emphasized are good long-term steady categories. So really the difference there, the delta came on the aiming solution side.\nMark Smith: Okay. And then I just want to clarify, Andy, the EBITDAS margin guidance that you gave, can you just give that to us again?\nAndrew Fulmer: Yeah. So the range that we're expecting is between 4% and 5.5%.\nMark Smith: Okay. And…\nAndrew Fulmer: Yeah. Go ahead.\nMark Smith: I was just going to say, it seems like a lot of that is the big driver of that is gross profit margin, looking for that to be down in the second half, and you walk through some of those reasons.\nAndrew Fulmer: Yeah. Great question. So as I talked about in the prepared remarks, it's really kind of, we kind of look at it in three pieces. So the majority is related to the investments that we've done in additional promotions and promotions we expect. So you saw a chunk of that in Q2. And really, like Brian talked about in his remarks, it's protecting market share. We believe those are great investments to be relevant with our consumers. Second piece is kind of the higher tariff products that I talked about, a little bit above our expectations in Q2. And as I talked about actually on the Q1 call, those variances, the way that our accounting works is, when those variances are recorded, they amortize off in roughly six months because we have about six months’ worth of inventory. So as those variances came in in Q2, we're expecting those to amortize off in Q4. The final piece is really inbound freight variances. So like tariffs, those are also capitalized in the first half and will amortize off in the second half. One thing I did want to kind of clarify though, we have seen significant savings in inbound freight since, kind of the, I'll call it the craziness of a couple years ago. What the delta relates to is more of a delay in timing of getting down to the expected rates which we're seeing today, which is great. So it's really just a timing issue of when those get amortized off in the second half of the year, and we expect that'll provide a tailwind going into fiscal ‘25. And in fact, if you look at like an -- almost like a pro forma, fiscal ‘24 pro forma basis on EBITDAS, between those our current inbound freight rates and also those vendor savings that both Brian and I talked about, that would add almost $3 million to the framework, that 4% to 5.5% that I talked about.\nMark Smith: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nAndrew Fulmer: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Eric Wold with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nEric Wold: Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. First off, a couple of questions around the launch of MEAT into Academy. Is this exclusive to Academy for some point in time, you kind of reference partners, in your prepared remarks. Will the product mix broaden over time? Will anything ever be exclusive to retail? And then, how should we think about pricing at retail versus your DTC? Is it always going to be the same, or kind of what drives the Delta there?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. Eric, it's Brian. So I love the interest around MEAT, and it was a really good first expansion of the brand, and we have plans to further expand it. And we teased at this for a few quarters, just around wanting to make sure that we had the right partner before we introduced the brand. We saw tremendous growth direct-to-consumer before beginning to introduce it. There were lots of things we wanted to do before that took place, obviously, the right partner. For us, merchandising is critical, making sure that the we can – the brand can show up in the way that consumers will expect it to show up. And then also there are some differences between, let's say, the consumers that are shopping on our website and some of the consumers that are walking into Academy stores. And so we have a slightly, there are some shared products between the two, but we do have some that are positioned more for Academy's customers and for that retail placement. So they're not one for one, and that's intentional, really, because we want this to be a win-win, and so far that's what we're seeing. Over time, I think, again, we want to be careful with the assortment. We have ambitious plans to increase the assortment of MEAT, as we expand that product line over time. And I would expect you'd continue to see some version of that showing up at retail, but ultimately complementing what we have online and really being that good partner for retailers. And then your question about pricing. Pricing in general is, I would say, pretty similar when it comes to EBITDA contribution is the way that we look at it because while gross margins might be higher direct-to-consumer, you obviously have more support costs that go into selling and marketing that product to consumers, and you're also shipping each of those. Whereas with this, you are getting some scale when you sell to the retailer, as you know, slightly lower gross margins, but overall pretty similar EBITDA contribution. So no major delta between the two.\nEric Wold: Thank you, helpful. And then just last question, you mentioned that some of the net sales outside the quarter was driven by retailers ordering earlier in the season than you saw last year. I guess, what do you think drove that and does that indicate anything around kind of more opportunities to unlock, open to buy dollars? And I guess, as you talk to the partners, are you getting any sense of optimism about return to kind of more normalize ordering patterns, or is that just something seasonally this year that we should be ready to?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. It's a really good question, so Brian again here. I think it's a few things. One is, you probably saw yourself that you were getting pinged earlier than usual with different promotions that retailers are running to try to draw on consumers and brands are doing the same thing. And I think the retailers looking around at each other really felt they had to get out ahead of that in anticipation. So we saw more interest from retailers earlier than we typically do to bring out product. That in combination with the fact we've got a stellar analytics team, sales ops team, that is constantly looking at our inventories in the channel. And while these retailers have undergone a lot of change, sometimes you need to prompt them and say, look, here's where your inventories are at, and it would make sense if you want to hit the timing and based on what everybody else is doing, for you to make this buy, a little bit of FOMO, but it's real. They don't want to miss the mark and they want to make sure they have every opportunity to get the most out of the consumer's wallet. And so it's really those two things. I think just observing what their peers were doing, promotions going out earlier than planned, some retailers having more inventory and wanting to get through that more quickly and seeing this as an opportune time to do that, and everybody kind of playing catch up from the retailer's standpoint. So it really ramped up very, very quickly in terms of that interest which we were pleased to see. But as a result it led to, I guess, heading out of October we had more sales than we expected because of those orders.\nEric Wold: Perfect. Thank you.\nBrian Murphy: Thanks Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Koranda: Hey, guys. Sounds like maybe we are starting to get a little bit of restocking activity in the traditional channel just based on the POS comments that you made and some of the comments you made in the Q&A here. Just wanted to see if maybe you could unpack for us where we're seeing the best lift in terms of brands for you guys or categories more broadly.\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. Hey, Matt. Brian here. So really, if you look at outdoor lifestyle category versus shooting sports, outdoor lifestyle is outperforming, 60% of our sales in the quarter came from outdoor lifestyle. In particular, the brands and products that have what's new, we alluded to it last quarter. It was our strong belief that as retailers were coming out of this trough and beginning to right-size inventory, seeing potential food traffic decline, really emphasizing what's new. In fact, Academy had their call earlier today, which we obviously listened to, and that was one of the takeaways that I heard was, look, we need to be showing these consumers what's new, getting them into our stores, and really separating ourselves from the pack. You're hearing that pretty consistently across the board, and so our outdoor lifestyle brands have, we've done a really good job of introducing, keeping that continuous pipeline of innovation. So we have seen as part of that as evidence, and I didn't say this in the prepared remarks, but when we look at our POS data, it's the higher-priced products, and most of those higher-priced products have come from recent product introductions, and that's where we're seeing some really good traction. So new products at higher ASPs, and I think that helps the retailer, obviously, make up for some of the lower traffic numbers. And then within shooting sports, pretty solid, I would say, results from our Marksman brands, Tipton, Wheeler, Frankford, Caldwell, and it's got a very similar story there. It's new products, really shine bright in the quarter. And then aiming solutions, that just seems like a category right now that consumers and therefore dealers and retailers are just a little bit shy in kind of investing in a big way there. So it will come back. It always does. But right now, those are some of the takeaways that we have.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. That's really helpful Brian. Thank you. And then I guess help us square that with the forward look that says, hey, we're likely to get a little bit more promotional over the next couple of quarters. I guess with the newness and the innovation you bring, I would assume that would bring less discounting. So maybe just talk a little bit about sort of the planned promotional strategy that you have. It did sound like, I guess, to be fair, a little bit of it was more shooting sports related, but maybe just unpack it for us so we can understand what the puts and takes are there.\nBrian Murphy: Yeah, Matt. This is Brian. I can start and then Andy, feel free to chime in. So I think the promotions that occurred in Q2, the way that everything kind of came together in a way, I think retailers were experiencing a little bit of FOMO (ph) and making sure that they had their incentives out earlier, and therefore placing those orders was, it's really, really important, especially in the online channel with our e-commerce retailers, to capture that moment. Because if you capture that moment correctly, you see a lot of consumer pull-through in this current period of time, it gives you this nice sort of visibility for the rest of the year, for the most part. So this is a really critical time of the year to make sure that you're front and center, in front of the consumer. As they come back, they post reviews, and honestly, you just have relevancy. It's a great billboard for that. So one, wanted to make sure that we were capturing that. So as we look in the second half of the year, will there be promotions? Certainly, there are going to be smart promotions, but I think it's going to be a slightly different flavor than what we did here in the second quarter, which was very strategic, and really taking advantage of that trail that we're really going after to stay in front of the consumer. So Andy, anything you want to add on the second half?\nAndrew Fulmer: No.\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. So I don't see anything else there. I think we'll continue to be vigilant on the shooting sports side, where there are opportunities. But at the same time, we've got great product, great brands, and we all know that will come back. So we just want to be judicious there.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay, fair enough. And then just, I know you addressed the MEAT sell-in a little bit in the Q&A here. But maybe could you guys talk about the status of Grilla because I know that was also something that you guys had planned to bring into the omnichannel this year potentially and just wanted to see what the latest update is there on Grilla entering sort of retail partners?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah, Brian again. So that is still our plan. We wanted to lead with MEAT. That was further along in the process. The other thing with Grilla is, as I alluded to in the prepared remarks, we do have a major new product launch coming in the next few months here, and then in the following quarters we have some additional ones that are truly innovative and fit with this evolve your backyard where people have made significant investments in their backyard and we believe that Grilla has every reason to be there. So we want to make sure that those product launches are done in a timely manner and if possible are done well with the cadence along with retail. We are really finding if we launch a new product direct-to-consumer, it depends on the product, but if it's a higher priced product and it's a little bit more innovative and we do a test run, we did it with like the Frankford Arsenal X-10 when we did that. I think we may have also done it with the Caldwell Claymore is we got tremendous feedback. We're able to get complete ownership with our communities. In this case, we've got 25,000, 30,000 Grilla users on Facebook, for example. And getting their support and buy-in is critical. So running these ahead of time just sets the groundwork. So once those pieces are all put together, you're talking about a really powerful retail expansion strategy. And so we need to make sure those things line up instead of just trying to sell Grills into retail. I don't think that's going to be as successful.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Fair enough. Just to clarify though that we should expect some form of retail sales for Grilla this year or we're not ready to commit to that yet?\nBrian Murphy: I think it's fair to assume some retail placement, but it's going to be more testing than anything else. It's not anything that's going to change the model for this year.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. All right. Got it. Maybe just last one you mentioned, the M&A environment may be kind of unfreezing a bit here as we move into the end of the year and into next year, calendar-wise. Maybe just wanted to hear your thoughts, Brian, in terms of what's interesting. Where are valuation expectations resetting to? Have they come down out of the stratosphere? How should we be thinking about sort of categories that you're interested in? And any just kind of early thoughts on sort of timing of any potential acquisitions that could happen over the next year or so?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. Things seem to be on fine and based on what we're hearing from investment bankers is that the first half of next year, first half of ‘24, we're going to see more activity. There's already more pitch activity going on right now. Along with that, because of just the function of the investment banking fees, you tend to attract larger companies that can pay those fees. So some sizable brands should be coming to market, that's at least what we expect. And we're certainly aware of several of them that we expect to come to market. And then we also have our own proprietary pipeline in place and that's very strong. So we're seeing fewer, last time we spoke, we were seeing more distressed type deals, certainly they're out there, but we're beginning to see a return of companies that are able to establish some level of run rate that then they can take and defend as they go out into market. With regard to valuation, I think it's still a little too soon because there hasn't been enough, just like real estate in a lower market, you don't see as many, not many data points, right? So it's hard to say exactly where things are shaking out, but I think that debt, the amount of debt a company can put on is a driving factor. I think you have financial buyers versus strategics. Financials are probably a little bit less ambitious when it comes to over-equitizing in a deal. And so that's where I think the debt piece is going to be critical, especially for financial buyers and those that are raising funds. So my expectation is that valuations are coming down and in the first half of next year, I think we'll see a closer alignment to seller and buyer expectations. I think three months ago there was a – and six months ago there was a much bigger Delta, but I think those are beginning to converge.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Very helpful. I'll take the rest of my time, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Mark Smith with Lake Street. Please go ahead.\nMark Smith: Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up on Black Friday a little bit more in depth and kind of two-part here. First, if we just look at traditional, did you guys participate a little bit more in Black Friday promotions around traditional retail this year versus last year and maybe if you can break up any impact from that on sales and margin and how that would impact Q2 versus Q3?\nAndrew Fulmer: Yeah, Mark. This is Andy. I think overall the promotional level at traditional was pretty consistent year-over-year. We worked with a number of retailers to -- in those types of promotions usually our front end where we'll discount product, sell that product to the retailer and then that retailer will run it in like a Black Friday ad or a mail or those types of things. But overall I think the level was, it might be a little bit above last year, but nothing real notable.\nMark Smith: Okay. And the other part is, as we look at Grilla and MEAT that you guys called out, some of the positive results there, can you quantify or call out maybe how much of that was driven by being fairly promotional or heavy discount versus just kind of natural growth in those brands?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. You said Mark, you sound like me when I first heard the news. I'm like, that's great. What was it profitable? And so I asked, what -- I knew some of the promotions that we were planning to run, but just generally, did we see anything unexpected there? The good news is that no, we didn't see anything unexpected. We didn't do anything above and beyond what would be I guess, call it, typical for us in prior years. So it wasn't like buy a Grilla, get a trampoline or something like that. Very reasonable Black Friday, Cyber Monday deals, and overall pleased with the EBITDA contribution we got from those.\nMark Smith: Excellent. Thank you.\nBrian Murphy: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Brian Murphy for closing remarks.\nBrian Murphy: Thank you, operator. Before we close, I want to let everyone know that we'll be participating in the ROTH Conference in Deer Valley on December 14th and 15th. And in January, we'll be attending SHOT Show in Las Vegas. We hope to connect with some of you at these upcoming events. As we head into the holidays, I'd like to give a special thanks to our employees whose loyalty, hard work, and dedication continues to move our company forward on the path towards an exciting long-term future. To those employees and to everyone else who joined us today, we wish you a happy and healthy holiday season, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Today's call contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of this time and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from our statements today. I have a few important items to note about our comments on today's call. First, we reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP results exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock compensation, shareholder cooperation agreement costs, facility consolidation costs, technology implementation, acquisition costs, other costs and income tax adjustments. The reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures, whether they are discussed on today's call, can be found in our filings as well as today's earnings press release, which are posted on our website. Also when we reference EPS, we are always referencing fully diluted EPS. Joining us on today's call is Brian Murphy, President and CEO; and Andy Fulmer, CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Murphy: Thanks, Liz, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased with our first quarter fiscal 2024 results, which reflected solid execution in sales, profitability and capital management combined with ongoing progress against our long-term strategic objectives. Net sales were generally flat compared to the prior, our result that met our expectations and that we view favorably given the fact that retailers continue to remain cautious about their inventories and available open to buy dollars in the quarter. We are especially pleased with the longer term growth we delivered. Our first quarter reflected net sales growth of nearly 31% over our pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020 with growth over 10% in shooting sports and over 54% in outdoor lifestyle, including our acquisition of Grilla Grills. On a year-over-year basis, our Shooting Sports category saw a slight decline in net sales compared to the prior year, a result that is consistent with reports from firearm manufacturers, citing ongoing, heightened channel inventory and reduced consumer demand. And just a reminder, we don't produce firearms, only shooting sports related accessories. The decline in shooting sports was offset by a slight increase in our outdoor lifestyle category, which consists of products related to hunting, fishing, camping, outdoor cooking and rugged outdoor activities. This is a solid result, which we believe reflects the strength of our brands in the category and the success of our strategy to invest in this growing part of our business. We continue to benefit from our strategy to intentionally place our brands where consumers expect to find them whether online or in store. In our traditional channel, net sales growth was strong, supported by new product introductions in hunting and fishing under our BOG and Bubba brands. We are encouraged by this result as we believe it reflects the ongoing convergence of inventory destocking activities by retailers with their need to replenish inventories. It also bodes well for many of our brands since we believe retailers are seeking out innovative products to help drive foot traffic and attract today's more discerning consumer. Net sales in our e-commerce channel declined year-over-year, driven primarily by our largest online retailer or partially offset by increased sales of certain hunting and shooting sports products to other online retailers. Online net sales of MEAT! Your Maker and Grilla, our two direct-to-consumer only brands were up slightly year-over-year. MEAT and Grilla generated over 35% of our total e-commerce sales and together, they delivered strong trailing 12 months net sales of over $24 million. That said, due to the planned closures of our Michigan and Texas retail Grilla stores, total net sales for these two brands were down slightly in the quarter. For several quarters now, we have provided certain sales data on Grilla and MEAT for three reasons. First, to demonstrate the performance of Grilla for its first year under our ownership since the acquisition. Second, to highlight the success, we can achieve by organically creating and launching a brand MEAT, using our brand lean architecture. And third, to provide a proxy for how well our brands are resonating directly with consumers since both of these brands have thus far been sold exclusively D2C. This is especially the case recently as the retail channel has been experiencing inventory challenges. Now, and as we've outlined in our strategic plan, we have the opportunity to expand the reach of these brands by moving them into retail distribution in the near future. This is an exciting and important step in our strategic plan that will allow our brands to access bigger markets and make it easier for consumers to find our products wherever they shop. It's important to note, however, that our goal is not to make it easier for competitors to target us. Therefore, in order to maintain our competitive advantage, we don't plan to detailed quarterly sales data on MEAT and Grilla going forward. Instead, (ph) we intend to begin reporting on an annual basis our direct-to-consumer sales totals as a subset of our total e-commerce sales. Turning back to the quarter. Point of sale data we received from our retailers indicates that sales of our products declined slightly in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by products in the shooting sports category. This is not a surprising result given the current environment. At the same time, POS data also indicates that channel inventory of our products improved in the quarter, lower on a sequential basis from Q4 and down in the mid-teens on a percentage basis year-over-year. We view this as a positive dynamic, which supports our belief, they will begin to see an increase in replenishment orders in the second half of the year. Innovation is our core strength and a key element in our long growth strategy. Our innovation engine fueled by our Dock & Unlock process is robust, a new products launched in the last two years generated over 21% of our first quarter net sales, a result that met our expectations. In the first quarter, we officially launched our new BUBBA tournament-grade Pro Series Smart Fish Scale or the BUBBA Pro SFS. Our first entry into the large underserved catch and release market. Since its launch in May, the BUBBA Pro SFS was awarded Best Cutlery Hand Pliers and Tools at ICAS 2023, the world's largest sport fishing tradeshow and was named the official scale of Major League Fishing or MLF beginning with the 2024 Bass Pro Tour season. Consumer response has been very strong and the MLF has just commenced filming competitions that will start to air in early 2024. It's early in the game, but we're very excited about what this partnership can do for the BUBBA brand long term. With that, I'll turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial results.\nAndrew Fulmer: Thanks, Brian. During Q1, we strengthened our balance sheet, fully paid-off the outstanding balance on our line of credit, demonstrated effective capital deployment with our share repurchase program, and delivered net sales and profitability in line with our expectations. All while navigating ongoing market challenges that included a continuation of cautious inventory management by retailers. We are pleased with our results for the quarter so let me walk you through the details. Net sales for Q1 were $43.4 million, compared to $43.7 million in Q1 last year, a slight decrease of 0.5%. Compared to pre-pandemic Q1 of fiscal 2020, net sales increased by 30.8% including the acquisition of Grilla. On a category basis, net sales in our outdoor lifestyle category increased slightly by 0.4%. This is a great result, which we believe demonstrates the strength of our brands and our new product capabilities. Turning to the Shooting Sports category. Net sales of shooting sports decreased by just 1.5% compared to Q1 last year. This too is a great result, given that net sales in the Shooting Sports category tend to align with trends in the firearms industry and adjusted NICS (ph) results, which have been under pressure. Our go-to-market strategy was formulated to intentionally place our brands where consumers expect to find them, whether that's online or in traditional brick-and-motor locations. Therefore by design net sales in these channels can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on consumer buying preferences. On a channel basis, first quarter net sales in our traditional channel increased 8.4% and net sales in our e-commerce channel decreased 10.6%. Turning to gross margin. Gross margin for Q1 came in at 45.4%, 180 basis points higher than our gross margin for Q1 last year. This result was driven primarily by lower inbound container freight costs. Turning to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $23.8 million compared to $24.6 million last year. The decrease was driven by one-time legal and advisory fees we incurred in Q1 last year relating to a shareholder cooperation agreement offset by an increase in outbound freight costs. On a non-GAAP basis operating expenses in Q1 were up slightly to $19.6 million compared to $19 million in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude intangible amortization, stock-compensation and certain non-recurring expenses as they occur. GAAP EPS for Q1 was negative $0.31, as compared with negative $0.42 last year. Our GAAP income tax expense was negatively impacted by approximately $0.07 due to evaluation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and an accounting treatment that removes any tax benefit we would have derived from our GAAP loss from operations. Excluding that impact, GAAP EPS would have been approximately negative $0.24 in Q1 of this year, and negative $0.32 in Q1 of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS was unchanged at $0.01 for the first quarter, both this year and last year. Our Q1 figures are based on our fully diluted share count of approximately 13.2 million shares. For full fiscal 2024, we expect our fully diluted share count will be about 13.5 million shares. Adjusted EBITDAS for the quarter was $1.1 million compared to $1.4 million last year. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to be pleased with our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we generated strong operating cash flow and free cash flow and continued to demonstrate effective capital deployment. Let me provide some of the details. We ended the quarter with cash of $18.7 million, after paying down $5 million on our line of credit and repurchasing approximately $2.3 million of our common stock. We generated $5.2 million in cash from operations and we invested just over $800,000 in CapEx resulting in free cash flow of approximately $4.3 million for the quarter. You’ll recall last quarter, I indicated our inventory levels would rise to above $100 million in Q1 and Q2, a planned increase design to support the fall hunting and holiday seasons, as well as new products that are scheduled for launch later this fiscal year. Consistent with this plan, our inventory levels increased by $5.2 million in the first quarter. It's worth noting that while we expect inventory levels to be above $100 million in Q2 and Q3 as well, we do expect them to move below $100 million by the end of fiscal 2024. We ended the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $75 million expandable line of credit, bringing our total available capital to over $108 million. Turning to capital expenditures. We spent just over $800,000 on CapEx for the first quarter, mainly for product tooling and patent costs. And as a reminder, our ERP project is now complete. For full fiscal 2024, we expect to spend between $3.5 million and $4.5 million for product tooling and maintenance. In addition, we expect a one-time spend of approximately $2.5 million to purchase assets such as warehouse racking, office furniture and other fixtures when we assume the full lease at our Columbia, Missouri facility on January 1. Therefore we expect total CapEx spend in fiscal 2024 in the range of $6 million to $7 million. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to employ all three of our capital allocation priorities: organic growth, M&A and returning capital to shareholders based on what is most opportunistic at the time. In the first quarter, we continued to return capital to shareholders through the stock repurchase program authorized by our board last September. In Q1, we repurchased roughly 268,000 shares at an average price of $8.43. Since the program began, we have repurchased roughly 645,000 shares or almost 5% of our shares, at an average price of $8.96 per share. Now we turning to our outlook. We continue to believe that fiscal 2024 could deliver fully year net sales growth of up to 3.5% supported by market share gains, expanded distribution and planned new product launches. We expect that growth will likely begin in Q3, following a year-over-year decline in revenue for Q2 due to the timing of shipments in first half of fiscal 2024. As a reminder, our business typically follows a seasonal pattern with Q1 as the lowest net sales quarter, Q2 and Q3 as the highest net sales quarters, and Q4 coming in higher than Q1 and we expect that pattern to continue in fiscal 2024. This pattern typically drives an increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding decrease in cash in Q2, with that cash collected by the end of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margins. We expect fiscal ‘24 gross margins to remain flat to fiscal 2023. With regard to OpEx, we believe that overall OpEx for fiscal 2024 will increase slightly, mainly from higher selling and distribution costs, offset by reductions from our facility consolidations, one-time legal and advisory fees, and IT implementation costs. Based on these factors, we continue to believe our adjusted EBITDAS in fiscal 2024 could increase as much as 6.5% compared to fiscal 2023. One final note one income tax expense, due to valuation allowance I discussed earlier, we expect to incur a small amount of income tax expense for GAAP purposes in each quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2024. With that, operator, please open the call for questions from our analyst.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Eric Wold with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nEric Wold: Thank you. Good afternoon. Couple of questions. I guess, one, just on the -- one on the guidance, just given expectations for flat gross margins? I still recall from the Q4 call, you're looking for margins to be up this year on lower freight expenses, benefits from the facility consolidation. Maybe what has changed your view from right or remembering that from where you were two months ago?\nAndrew Fulmer: Yeah, Eric. This is Andy. Great question. We did have some higher variances in the first quarter that we expect to kind of amortize off in Q3. So Q3 margin, we're expecting to be down a little bit and that kind of will offset the increase in gross margin you saw in Q1. It's really just a function of how our amortization works over our inventory turns.\nEric Wold: Got it. Okay. And then digging into the POS a little bit, any sense from -- if you dive into the data a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in terms of demand by price points, anything -- any major shifts that give you their increased confidence or increased concern around some of the consumer demographics?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah, Eric. This is Brian. So I guess, so specific to price points, I wouldn't say that we're seeing much, much variance at least in the data that we can see, right? So most of our brands are kind of at that mid to high price point, where we play. So we still maintain the view that that consumer seems to be somewhat more insulated than a lower price point items. So I can't really speak to some of those lower price point ones. Is there anything, anything else in particular outside of price that you have a question about it related to POS?\nEric Wold: I mean, any trends that you're seeing maybe that would give you increased confidence or maybe concern around kind of the underlying demand maybe outside of price in terms of product categories, regional differences?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. I mean, I think we're seeing, like we said, we're pleased with at least in the current quarter what POS trends have been, while they were down slightly in shooting sports pretty flat as it relates to outdoor lifestyle. So I'd say between those two categories, outdoor lifestyle seems to be the most resilient at this time. But we are seeing some nice stabilization in shooting sports and -- but I think those the retailers that are selling more of that product are seeing a bigger impact at this point. So outdoor lifestyle in particular seems to be doing much better. And then specifically within outdoor lifestyle, hunting. Hunting has been doing pretty well. Fishing has been doing pretty well for us. So I'd say on a whole outdoor lifestyle seems to be very much better right now.\nEric Wold: Got it. And then just final question, I'll make an effort on it. With the BUBBA Fishing scale launch and the app launch, any early indicators or data points you want to throw it around, attach rates of app downloads to scale purchasers or subscriptions, anything or is it still a little too early?\nBrian Murphy: It's a little early. One, I'm happy that you ask the question because we're also obviously very excited about the scale. The MLF partnership is a huge deal for us and we hope it's a huge deal for the MLF and we've got some big plans with that partnership going forward. With that said, I mean, the reception for consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. It's got, gosh, last night, look 5 stars on the app store within Apple. I think close to 150 reviews, which for a very technical product, we're very, very, very happy about because that just increases the stickiness. So it's exceeded our expectations thus far, but I think it's still a little too early to begin sharing some of that data.\nEric Wold: Got it. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Smith with Lake Street. Please go ahead.\nAlex Sturnieks: Hey, guys. It's Alex Sturnieks on the line for Mark Smith today. Just first off, you guys kind of discussed the retail channel performing well. Could you maybe talk more about any additional retail locations you guys have entered in the quarter? And then maybe how you feel about your shelf space for your brands and products there?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. So hey, Alex, this is Brian. So I'd say within the quarter, retail, we did see an increase in international sales. So on the traditional side, obviously traditional was up about 8.5% maybe a little shy of that in the quarter. E-com was down slightly. So we are seeing some pretty good traction with traditional retailers, physical retail stores. Also as a reminder, e-comm was -- had some pretty significant increases over the last couple of years as people were stuck at home and doing more of that ordering. But in terms of what's driving that, it is market share. We are seeing that in several categories. And the way we'd also define market share is through the introduction of new products. So we are, as you know, a very innovative company and focused on both new product launches. And so for us to be able to maintain and capture even more of that. We believe is certainly reflected in those numbers.\nAlex Sturnieks: Yeah. That's helpful. So then kind of on the line of new products too, how do you feel about the distribution of BUBBA products in both historically more coastal markets and then also like more so in the inland markets as well?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. That's a great, great question. Have been wondering if you're an angler yourself. So one of the challenges we had when we bought BUBBA was to your point, it was mostly a coastal brand and in particular it was focused on fillet knives. And so our goal was to take that brand, take the DNA. And we saw this much larger market in freshwater, which is more inland and thought to ourselves, how do we go after that market? So we started with obviously introducing other cutlery related items and tools. And so the smart fish scale for us, I know we talk a lot about it. You're probably getting sick of us talking about it at this point. But it really was our clever way of entering that market. And if you want to do something like that, it's best to establish a beachhead through innovation and then coming behind it with other products. So for us, it's an important beachhead to continue introducing the BUBBA brand to that consumer. So like if you were to look at Google Trends, for example, and look at BUBBA blade versus BUBBA and some of the freshwater products versus salt. You're going to begin to see that there is sort of this climbing interest in the middle of country, especially around freshwater lakes and things and it's really part of that strategy. So I think that it's pretty rare for a fishing brand to crossover from salt to fresh and from fresh to salt, et cetera. But that's sort of our strategy has been and we're seeing the traction of that right now. So at the store level, certainly, we've gone from being very well penetrated on the coasts and we're seeing much more adoption for the BUBBA brand, in the middle of the U.S.\nAlex Sturnieks: Yeah. That's awesome to hear. And then just a quick last one for me. You guys kind of touched your balance sheet improved during the quarter, it's looking pretty healthy. Can you guys discuss a little bit more in-depth about your thoughts around the capital allocation? But with the new products innovation seeming to drive these sales, could you see some additional spending in R&D to drive more product innovation, the upcoming quarters or kind of how are you going to go about that with your allocation there?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. Great question. This is Brian again. And Andy, Andy can chime in. So, we are focused on obviously organic growth, M&A, share buybacks being our kind of primary three. Obviously, we paid down debt as well in the quarter. But we are very focused on organic through innovation and it's one of the reasons, one of our strategies for maintaining our margins and ultimately higher ASPs, et cetera. So when we think about that, R&D, to your point, it's a huge part of that, right? I mean, gosh, almost 12% to 15% of our total workforce are people that are dedicated to just R&D and product development, which in my view is a very, it's a high percentage relative to some of the other companies that I'm aware of and have even looked at to acquire. And so one of the reasons why I think it is a lighter percentage relative to the total versus some other companies. is the fact that we have through consolidation moving facilities into Columbia. We've used some of those savings to bulk up our R&D department. So instead of outsourcing prototyping instead of outsourcing some of those functions, or even relying upon other third parties. We've decided to take that in-house and really leverage the intellectual property we have through our incredible engineers and designers and do most of what we can in house. So that gets us to market more quickly. It ensures that we can sort of lock up this innovation pipeline that we've talked about. So I think as a percentage of sales, I think it's a good number. But I don't think we're missing any dollars there. I think spending it wisely. And our pipeline as you'll see over the coming years will definitely show the fruit of that.\nAlex Sturnieks: Hey, thanks. That's very helpful. Thank you guys.\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Koranda: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Wondered if you could maybe just elaborate a bit more on the retail expansion for Grilla and MEAT. I know you said you're not going to necessarily be providing quarterly data points on it, but I'm just curious at a higher level, any way to think about the entry into retail, whether that's through specific strategic retailers that you'll be dealing with, are there limited SKUs you're going into retail with or are you going in with the full set of SKUs that they offer timing of entry? Is that factored into the growth outlook this year? Just some details, high level on that would be very helpful.\nBrian Murphy: Yeah, certainly. Hey, Matt. This is Brian. So yeah, I mean, we're very excited about MEAT and Grilla and one of the strategies that we had, one, when we started MEAT was to generate enough interest where we could get the opportunity to place it at certain retailers. And if you have an unknown brand and you're trying to sell it into retail, it's a much more difficult value proposition. If it's a brand that has gained steam, it's more well known, influencers are getting behind the brand. You get to a point where retailers are approaching you and that's definitely the case that we're faced with the opportunity. So we have been very careful about when to bring MEAT! Your Maker into retail. And obviously, we bought Grilla, just over a year ago and so the same there. And we've been, we've enjoyed the direct-to-consumer path. We think there's still tremendous upside for those two brands in direct-to-consumer. With that said, there is an opportunity to get the brands in front of consumers because that is part of marketing. Some folks that is their exposure to certain brands. And so we have been approached by some retailers that we think very, very highly of have been good partners of ours. And to have a specific viewpoint on how to approach the market with the new brand and some innovation. And so we are, we have been selective with who those retail partners are. I can't share those with you right now. But ultimately, we're going to start out small make sure that we have the right sort of flywheel built with the consumer, make sure that we're supporting it appropriately. We've seen brands go into retail too quickly, too much too soon. And we've sort of learned from that on the sidelines and so we want to do it in the right way certainly, come out with the splash with certain retailers and then assess as we go forward. So, we're being a little cautious on sharing too much, but we do expect this year in this fiscal to be announcing some of those some of that placement.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. That's fair. And just maybe spinning back to the retailer inventory health that you talked about in the prepared remarks and maybe discussed a bit in the Q&A here. Just curious how we're thinking about a replenish cycle and how that kicks off? I mean, we've just gotten a lot of data points recently from retailers that suggest that consumer demand is still pretty soft and it just seems like retailers are still quite reticent to take on a lot of inventory. So curious how you think that plays out this year? I know you said probably more likely to result in back half growth, but just maybe if you could elaborate on how you're thinking about the replenishment cycle, as we get into the back half of the year?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. Great question, Matt. It's Brian again and Andy feel free to jump in. I think it's -- there's a few things here. One is, there aren't any sort of broad brush strokes across the retail landscape. We're seeing a tale of many cities. We're seeing some retailers depending on the product categories that they're in are faring better than others and others that have managed inventory more tightly that we've seen them bounce back already. When we look at replenishment, we're having this conversation before the call, we do get replenishment. It's not like a flip, a light switch flips as you know. And all of a sudden they start ordering. They're already ordering. All these retailers are still replenishing their inventories with our products, but it's a matter of looking at their targeted inventory turns in the year and as consumer demand has slowed that number in order to reach those turns is somewhat of a moving target and I think you've even maybe commented on that some of your in some of your reports. So the other dynamic that I haven't really seen come out in earnings calls is, is the fact that, that some retailers really had to look to online sales to be successful over the last two to three years or the other ones had to play hurry up offense. And so that gave them a tremendous benefit. As a result, if you look at the same demand, if you just assume the same demand pre-COVID versus where we are today, or what a normalized level looks like. I think you're going to see some retailers who are well run carry less inventory because they may have some vendors who are able to do more drop shipping. So what that means for them is they can obviously offer more assortment. But at the same time, they don't have to carry that inventory. They can sort of lean on the manufacturers of the vendors more to carry some of that. So, yet to be seen what that looks like, but I think the vendors that have that capability to dropship and can do it effectively and be a good partner with some of those retailers. I think we'll see some of those, be more successful. And certainly we have that ability. Does that answer your question, Matt?\nMatthew Koranda: Yeah, absolutely. That's very helpful, Brian. Thank you. And then I guess just maybe one for Andy, and I think maybe this has been asked in different ways in the past. But as you take over the full lease in the Columbia facility. Just curious how we should be thinking about modeling OpEx costs in the back half of the year, since it's the Jan 1, I think take over?\nAndrew Fulmer: Yeah. Great question. It is January 1st, we take that over. That is built into our OpEx assumptions and the framework that we provided with the EBITDAS could be up to 6.5%. I can't really get more specific than that. I think what you'll see is as we get closer, when we take that the extra space over and then into the next fiscal year, we'll be able to share more details.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess just last one, I guess it's somewhat of a traditional question. Lots of different people attack it on these calls, but maybe Brian, could you take a crack at talking about M&A and just the funnel as we see it today? I mean, now that you have the debt, basically wiped clean, share buybacks been exercised with good results. Just curious how we should be thinking about M&A, our appetite there, what the funnel looks like, how folks are thinking about valuation? Are there more catalysts to bring folks to the market? What are you seeing on that front?\nBrian Murphy: Yeah. So, I kind of give you a sense for the environment right now. And then what I think is just my own opinion what I think will sort of happen in the next few quarters based on our conversations with people. But certainly, we've seen the number of deals come to market by sell-side advisors, investment bankers has come down pretty significantly. And I think that's for two reasons. One is valuation expectations have lowered. And also, I think that some of those companies, depending on which categories they're in, have -- maybe have now reached a run rate EBITDA that they would like to get sort of credit for going forward. And so they're looking for sort of multiple stabilization, run rate stabilization, before they come back to market. With that said, we are seeing fewer deals, but we are continuing to be very, very aggressive in our outbound efforts. So both Andy and I are always picking up the phone reaching out to people that we want to go after that we think would be highly complementary. And so that continues. And so we've got a, I've all these that were robust. We've got a very robust pipeline and a number of people that we're currently speaking with and we'll see where those go. Like you said, we've got a very clean balance sheet. We have capacity. We're in a great spot and we're also not sacrificing our efforts on the share repurchase side. So we're in about as good as a position as you can be in, I think. when it comes to M&A. And then looking out, I think, look, Q1, Q2 -- calendar, Q1, Q2 of next year, I think that we will start to see more deals come back to market. That's sort of the sense that I have in speaking with advisors and with companies directly. Because I think they'll have more line of sight around what run rate, EBITDA performance looks like. And that's very similar to what you're hearing from people like us and even other public companies as they sort of look down the barrel of some of these forecasts that provided to us from our retailers and give us that sort of more comfort based on what we know today about replenishment coming back.\nMatthew Koranda: Okay. Super helpful. I'll leave it there guys. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Murphy for any closing remarks.\nBrian Murphy: Thank you, operator. Please note, we will be participating in two upcoming investor conferences, the Lake Street Conference in New York City on September 14th. And the CL King Best Ideas Virtual Conference on September 18th. We hope to see some of you at those events. In closing, I want to thank our employees across American Outdoor Brands for their great work this quarter and for helping our customers and our consumers make the most out of the moments that matter. Thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
