There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Nathan Judge, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNathan Judge: Thank you, Betsy, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. This morning, the company issued a press release announcing results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended December 31, 2023. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investor Relations section on ReNew's website at www.renew.com. With me this morning are Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman, and CEO; Kailash Vaswani, our CFO, and Vaishali Nigam Sinha, Co-Founder and Chairperson of Sustainability. After the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, our Safe Harbor statements are contained within our press release, presentation materials and materials available on our website. These statements are important and integral to all our remarks. There are risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. So we encourage you to review the press release we furnished in our Form 6-K and the presentation on our website for a more complete description. Also contained in our presentation materials and annual report are certain non-IFRS measures that we reconcile to the most comparable IFRS measures, and these reconciliations are also available on our website in the press release, presentation materials and our annual report. It is now my pleasure to hand it over to Sumant.\nSumant Sinha: Yes, hi. Thank you, Nathan. Good morning and good evening to everybody on this call. I'm glad to have you on our third quarter fiscal year ended 2024 earnings call. The calendar year 2023 marked a significant milestone for the Indian renewable energy sector as well as for us. India, now the world's most populous nation, has experienced a surge in power demand, necessitating the need for more power. In April of 2023, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ramped up the auction calendar significantly in a bid to achieve the country's 500 gigawatt target for renewable energy installations. The government's commitment has now transpired into action and a record number of auctions have been conducted so far during the year. So far in fiscal 2024, we have seen more than 40 gigawatts of auctions being conducted, which is a significant increase over last year when about 12 gigawatts of capacity was auctioned. Not only this, we are also tracking another 70 gigawatts of central and state tenders expected to be auctioned over the next few months. As India intensifies its Made in India initiatives to become a global manufacturing hub more broadly, the imperative for securing reliable power becomes even more pronounced. This expansion of the addressable renewable energy market has provided developers such as us the most favorable environment in the renewable energy sector that we have seen yet. As the number of auctions has increased significantly, competition has tailed off a little bit, leading to the discovery of higher tariffs. The subscription rate for new auctions has declined significantly this fiscal year and were the lowest on record this past quarter, often less than 100% of the capacity being auctioned for complex projects, resulting in auctions clearing pretty much at the initial bid offer. Year-to-date, we have seen an increase in tariffs and in particular in wind auctions, which increased 14% year-on-year. Our differentiated ability to do wind makes us stand out in a market where there are far fewer developers with this ability. We note that even with the increase in tariffs, renewable energy continues to be the lowest cost source for new electricity supply in the country, considerably cheaper than the primary competitive alternate, which is coal power. Beyond the rise in tariffs, we saw several other factors that are supporting better returns, such as a record fall in the cost of solar modules, stable FX, adequate domestic debt financing and a significant reduction in receivable days. The year, which started with a litany of challenges, has become one of the most favorable markets for ReNew in our history. As we approach the onset of fiscal year 2025, we eagerly anticipate leveraging the new opportunities that have risen during the year, especially in complex firm power such as the round-the-clock power and peak power projects that are currently under construction. This demand for complex projects is clearly evident in the rising percentage of such projects and such auctions. This fiscal year, complex projects represented about 38% of total capacity being auctioned, significantly more than the 8% of the total amount last year. This is set to increase further to 44% of the tenders that we expect to be auctioned over the next several months. We continue to see higher returns in complex auctions and a greater share of our wins are in this subset. ReNew has clear competitive advantages in complex auctions and as a result our market share in these auctions is better than any of our peers. Firstly, modeling these projects is not easy. Further, executing complex projects requires expertise in developing wind, integrating multiple sources of power through the use of digital tools, as well as robust project management, something that most players in the sector lack. Our in-house wind EPC capability, our in-house digital labs and our ability to access the cheapest source of capital do ensure superior returns on our projects. The year is set to be a milestone year for us. As on the execution front, the year will see a significant increase in our operating portfolio as most of the under construction pipeline will become operational, providing top line and bottom line growth. Now, turning to highlights for the quarter on Page 4, we are increasing the bottom end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to INR 63 billion to 66 billion. Amidst a record-breaking year for megawatt installations, we expect that about 1.75 gigawatts to 1.95 gigawatts will be generating revenue by the end of fiscal year 2024. Beyond the currently commissioned 825 megawatts, we have erected 475 megawatts of wind turbines and another 620 megawatts of solar module installations. Our strategy of asset recycling continues to provide us with cost effective capital for expansion. Last month we signed a deal for the sale of a 300 megawatt solar asset commissioned two years ago and we anticipate receiving proceeds of approximately U.S. $82 million by year end. The asset was valued at U.S. $dollars 199 million. This transaction will further bolster the substantial sum raised through asset recycling thus far and at the same time enhance the returns on capital deployed on projects. We expect that we will realize a gain of about U.S. $30 million to U.S. $34 million as a gain in our Q4 '24 EBITDA. Do note that our FY '24 adjusted EBITDA guidance of INR 63 billion to INR 66 billion does not include this gain. Our growth trajectory remains robust as we won an additional 3.6 gigawatts of RE projects during the quarter, in a period when tariffs are rising, costs are falling and competition is near record lows, which underscores our ability to secure growth at attractive returns. We point this out because last year, when all these factors were unfavorable and returns for new projects were much lower, our market share was a mere 3%, well below our normal market share of 10% or thereabouts. Comparing it to this year in an environment where returns are much higher, we have won about 15% of all auctions. We believe, and that is on top of a bigger base, we believe that this illustrates our commitment to capital discipline rather than just market share. We are pleased also to report that our DSOs, our days outstanding, have fallen below 100 days and stood at 86 days at the end of the quarter, marking a significant improvement of 92 days within the span of a year and an even greater improvement from the peak of 272 days only a couple of years ago. Prioritization of timely collection of payables remains paramount for us as it fortifies our competitive stance in the market and has released nearly $200 million of cash for growth. We believe that DSOs will continue to improve over time. Furthermore, there has been a notable enhancement in wind PLF this year. For the quarter, the 17% wind PLF was a meaningful improvement over the 14.7% PLF in the prior comparable quarter and year-to-date the wind PLF was at 29.2% better than the wind PLF of 27.3% last year. While the uptrend in wind PLF is encouraging and there is increasing evidence that wind speeds are recovering towards long-term normal levels, in the long-term, our guidance does not take this into consideration in an effort to remain consolidated. I am proud to say that we were profitable for the trailing 12-month period with a profit of U.S. $44 million. We recognize that many investors consider profitability as a key investment decision metric and these results should increase RNW's attractiveness to a broader universe of investors. While our cash flow from operations has always been positive and growing, we believe that we are now at the scale needed to be profitable consistently on an annual basis and be able to showcase the full value of our platform. We reported cash from operations of U.S. $616 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to U.S. $595 million for the prior period. Our profit after tax was U.S. $43 million for the nine-month period this year compared to a loss in the prior comparable period, an improvement of almost actually U.S. $100 million. Turning to Page 5, electricity demand, growth and the macroeconomic environment, continues to favor RE development in India. Firstly, the auction markets continue to propel larger number of auctions and better tariffs. Over 40 gigawatts of auctions have already been completed year-to-date and various state and central agencies are working towards another 70 gigawatts, likely to be completed over the next few months. Not only this, the share of complex projects went from 8% last year to about 38% this year, signaling a persistent shift towards complex projects. Further, the tariffs continued to trend upwards as there was less competition. Amongst the tenders that we are tracking we expect the share of complex projects to go up even further owing to the need for firm power in the country. Secondly, cost to construct RE continues to improve as solar module prices that make up 40% to 50% of the total cost to construct a solar farm have fallen by around 55% from the prior quarter to hit historical lows of about U.S. $0.11 per watt peak. So let me say that again, they've fallen to hit U.S. $0.11 per watt peak. In addition, supply related challenges that constrained us last year were resolved as our own manufacturing facility came online during the year. We would note that the cost of sales has broadly mirrored the declines seen in module prices, making our manufacturing costs competitive with imports after considering the BCD or import duties. Turning to Page 6, our patient and selective approach in auctions has ensured that we are able to deliver superior returns on our projects. With over 40 gigawatts of projects auctioned in the current year, there have been several auctions that were undersubscribed. Lower competition in auctions enables us to lock-in superior tariffs, and we saw subscription levels lower than 100% in auctions for complex projects. Our in-house EPC and an integrated supply chain that ensures delivering large projects on time enable us to bid comparatively, securing higher returns. Our digital and AI platform, bundled with our experience in developing complex solutions, provides us with a significant advantage over others. While we don't pursue market share, our market share has gone up by almost five times compared to the prior fiscal year, from having only a 3% market share last year when returns were much lower to about 15% market share this fiscal year with projects that are projected to have significantly higher returns. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach to growth and pursue the highest return opportunities in the market. Turning to Page 7, our core strength lies in our ability to execute projects over time and on time, within budget and deliver initially expected returns. The on-ground progress remains strong as we have erected about 1.9 gigawatts of assets on the ground. Off this total, 825 megawatts of projects have already received COD approvals and in addition we have erected 474 wind turbines and installed 620 megawatts of solar modules. During this period we have also installed 150 megawatt hours battery storage facility for our Peak Power Project. In addition, we also commissioned 276 kilometers of transmission during the quarter. We are beginning to see real constraints emerging in getting access to interconnection hubs and this new business for us is beginning to provide considerable competitive advantages in bidding for new projects. With that, I would like to turn it over to Kailash to go over the latest financials.\nKailash Vaswani: Thank you, Sumant. Turning to Page 9, interest from domestic lenders for our project continues to be strong. Recently we were able to refinance a $325 million bond in the domestic markets with an interest rate that was around 200 basis points lower than the landed interest rate on that bond. Through the refinancing, we were once again able to demonstrate how we have been able to provide long-term finance to our projects with interest rates at sub 9%. In India, the yield spreads were Indian RE debt have compressed significantly as the sector has matured. While we stay focused on domestic debt markets given their low cost versus U.S. dollar green bond market, we have seen yields on our own U.S. dollar bond improve by about 200 basis points in little over the last four months. It is also worth noting that the average spread on our bonds are about the same level as it was at the beginning of the Fed tightening cycle back in 2022. Turning to Page 10, our asset recycling program continues to see strong interest from international investors as well as domestic players. Last month, we signed an agreement for the sale of a 300 megawatt solar asset and expect to about $82 million of net proceeds by the year end, which is the fiscal year end. The proceeds from this asset sale are expected to be reinvested in projects that in the current strong bidding market where project cost to run rate EBITDA are in the range of 6.5 to 7.5 times EBITDA should have even higher returns than the one just sold. Subject to the rate at which we can raise growth capital from asset recycling, we should be able to grow 1 to 1.5 gigawatt net of asset recycling without having to issue any new shares. Asset recycling effectively provides us with long-term growth capital at the cheapest possible cost of equity and thereby enabling us to grow while enhancing returns on capital. Turning to Page 11, we reported profit after tax for the nine-month period ended 31, December 2023 of U.S. $43 million as compared to a loss of approximately U.S. $60 million in the prior year. This was driven primarily by higher revenues and savings and finance cost. During the quarter, we saw significant improvement in wind PLF as compared to the prior comparable quarter. The wind PLF during the quarter was 17% compared to 14.7% in the same quarter last year, bolstering our confidence about the recovery in the long-term wind PLF towards normalized levels. Though our guidance expects the wind speed will be in the same as last year, our operating capacity increased by 940 megawatt over the last comparable quarter in the prior year, an increase of about 12%. We reported an adjusted EBITDA of U.S. $150 million for quarter 3 FY '24, an increase of about 8%. The higher EBITDA is primarily attributable to additional revenue from projects commissioned during the period. This was partially offset by higher operating costs in line with the increase in capacity.\nDISCOMs: Turning to Page 13, our balance sheet continues to expand and improve. Our cash balance stood at over $1.1 billion excluding the $325 million which was repaid in January of this year and our project level net debt was about U.S. $5.4 billion. During January of this year we refinanced our $325 million bond maturing in April '24, saving 200 basis points and extending the maturity to 15 years. Based on the current level of interest rates, we will continue to evaluate opportunities wherein we are able to refinance debt at lower interest rate than the coupon on that debt. This year, in addition to the $8 billion MoU that we signed with PFC and REC, we have signed an additional MoU of ADB for about $5.3 billion of debt financing, bringing the total amount of access of capital to over $13 billion. These MoUs enable us in creating multiple avenues through which we can access debt at competitive rates and reduce the interest rate burden on our profit and loss account. With that, I would like to turn it over to Vaishali to talk about our ESG initiatives.\nVaishali Nigam Sinha:\nRefinitiv: We were also recognized as one of the top performing companies by Sustainalytics, both as regional and industry leaders. We continue to maintain our CDP climate change rating to B which is the management band, which is higher than the Asia regional average of C and same as the renewable power generation sector average of B. In S&P CSA our score has increased to 53 from 41. We received multiple awards including the prestigious Terra Carta Seal for actively leading the charge to create a climate and nature positive future. We also received the World Economic Forum Lighthouse for the second time for our leadership in fourth industrial revolution technologies and highest category of recognition which is resilient by CII Climate Action Program which is CAP 2.0. Social responsibility continues to remain integral to our business. Since 2014 we have influenced lives of over a million people across 500 villages across India, spanning over ten states. On the right hand side of the deck are some of the key programs which also include employee participation. Under Lighting Lives program the electrification of 60 schools is under progress in partnership with HSBC. The climate curriculum was rolled out to 9000 students. Project Surya, which is implemented in partnership with UNEP, nearly 210 women have completed their training as renewable energy technicians who earlier used to work in the very hard solar salt farming area in Gujarat. The 9th Edition of Gift Warmth Campaign 2023 has benefited around 200,000 people. Back to you. Thank you.\nSumant Sinha: Yes, thank you, Vaishali. Turning to our annual guidance, we are raising the bottom end of our FY '24 guidance range by 2% and now expect FY '24 adjusted EBITDA of INR 63 billion to INR 66 billion. As we said earlier, this excludes gains on sale of assets. On construction, we expect that about 1.75 gigawatts to 1.95 gigawatts will be generating revenue by the end of the year. As some of our projects have received COD extensions, this presents an opportunity to sell power on the exchange at prices often substantially higher than the PPA tariff. With regards to our FY '25 guidance, we anticipate sharing our outlook with investors during our fourth quarter FY '24 earnings call. We would remind investors that we sold 400 megawatts of assets this year that would have otherwise contributed around INR 2 billion in FY '25, although the EBITDA contribution from the asset sale proceeds will be even greater in future years as the capital is redeployed. Lastly, we also anticipate being conservative on our weather assumptions in our FY '25 guidance. Whilst the weather trends have been better this year versus the prior several years, we are also focused on delivering on our promises to investors. With that, we will be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nikhil Nigania with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nNikhil Nigania: Yes, hi, thank you for taking my question and good set of numbers. My first question is on the competitive intensity. Good to see it come down, but I would be keen to understand what is driving it. Is it the sheer quantum of auctions or is there some other reason why the competitive intensity has come down in the auctions?\nSumant Sinha: Yes Nikhil, hi. So look, I think you kind of posed the answer in the question itself. See, last year, as we said, about 12 gigawatts of auctions happened. This year that number is 40 gigawatts. And so I would say that most of our competitors have pretty full pipelines right now, as do we. And because there are so many auctions happening, you can always win the next one. And so I think for all of those reasons, the competitive intensity on any given project, on any given auction, has come down quite markedly.\nNikhil Nigania: Got it, Sumant. The second point then I had is on the module price crash, which would benefit us. So I wanted to understand how much of the pipeline is the module price locked and for how much of the balance part we'll be able to gain from these low module prices?\nSumant Sinha: So you should assume that everything that we've been buying in the last three months and beyond will be benefiting from these lower prices. And therefore, actually, if I were to take a step back, our decision to postpone execution of projects in the last financial year was actually because module prices that time were $0.26 to $0.28, was actually quite on the money, because over the course of the last twelve months, module prices have fallen so much. And so we are able to now commission these solar projects at tariffs, at costs that are significantly lower, 20% to 30% lower in some cases, compared to what they would have been had we done them earlier. So yes, from this point, from the last, I would say three to four months in fact even, all the modules that we are buying now are with lower module prices.\nNikhil Nigania: So would it be fair to assume most of the capacity coming up in FY '25 should benefit from this?\nSumant Sinha: Yes, absolutely.\nNikhil Nigania: Got it. But then Sumant there's a related point then. So the ReNew's own module manufacturing plant then, how is that faring and how is that being able to compete against this $0.11 or what peak module prices?\nSumant Sinha: Because, as you know, there is first of all a 40% import duty, so that takes that $0.11 up to whatever, close to 15.5 cents [ph] and that is not very dissimilar to what the cost is if you import modules, pay the 25% BCD on a much lower number. The imported price of modules of cells is about close to about 5.5 cents. So 25% on that is maybe 1.5 so a little bit less than that. So it gets you the cells at about 7 cents here in India and then the conversion price takes you up to about 15 to 16 cents. So you're pretty much at the same level as you would be if you were buying modules from China. Now also keep in mind the fact that ALMM was supposed to come in from this year, 1st April. So any projects that were not grandfathered will have to buy domestic modules going forward.\nNikhil Nigania: Understood. Are you also looking to buy for China or important modules will not be there? Got it. So are you also looking to export some modules like some peers are?\nSumant Sinha: Our first priority is to supply modules to ourselves. So we will look at first doing that and secondly, to the extent that we have any overflow modules which we probably will have some amount this year, we will certainly look at selling that in whichever market gives us the best returns. Now keep in mind one more thing that we'll also have our cell plant getting commissioned fairly soon, and that allows us to sell into the domestic DCR market where also the tariffs are higher because those require cells made in India as well. And so therefore we could do either of the two, we could sell projects with cells made in India into the DCR market at a higher tariff, or we could sell overseas. Now, we haven’t -- to be honest with you, we are not sort of giving any sort of guidance on that right now, because obviously we want to prioritize our own requirement sources.\nNikhil Nigania: Understood, Sumant. One last question from my side is then on the pipeline side, I saw some delay in the RTC project. Good to see part of it commissioned, but I wanted to understand what is the reason? And B, is transmission incrementally becoming a bottleneck, as you seem to be hinting in the presentation, for commissioning of future renewable capacity in India?\nSumant Sinha: So, yes. I think one of the things that has happened this year is that because the amount of renewables is now crossing certain levels, the grid manager, which is really the Central Electricity Authority, has decided to really become a lot more careful about giving connectivity approvals and commissioning approvals to new renewable energy projects. So these processes of commissioning therefore are taking longer than they were taking earlier. And that is why you'll perhaps see that the amount of commissioning this year in the RE sector is at this point of the year lower than what would have been expected for the industry as a whole, largely because of these new connectivity and commissioning requirements that are sought to be now kept as a higher standard by the grid managers. And I think that's fair, it's a perfectly legitimate thing for them to do. But what that has meant is that the earlier process where once the project was ready, we could turn it on and get it connected to the grid within a matter of two to three days. That process now is taking a lot longer. It's taking as long as four to six weeks now. And that, in some ways, is delaying the commissioning of new projects for everybody, not just for us. The second thing that is happening is that the connectivity approvals into the grid, and I may be getting a little technical here, are also taking a lot longer than they used to take earlier, because now, especially for these complex projects, which are getting commissioned for the first time or getting connected to the grid for the first time, the grid managers want us to do meet very high standards, which require very extensive modeling of how the whole plant would actually operate under very many different circumstances and situations. And that, by the way, is also a very big learning for us, because we have now gone through this process, both for RTC and for Peak Power, and therefore, we are the only company that has gone through this process of what does this connectivity process actually imply and entail. And so chalk that up to another sort of strength that we now have on these complex projects. We've gone through that and frankly, it's taken us almost three to four months to get some of these connectivity approvals, which used to take literally a month earlier, so all of that has actually caused some delays in connections to the grids and that is why you see that we are now, over the next month or so, going to be connecting a lot of projects into the grid.\nNikhil Nigania: Thank you, Sumant.\nNathan Judge: Yes, Sumant. You may also want to talk a little bit about the opportunity to pre-sell some of the power while we're waiting for those CODs.\nSumant Sinha: Yes. So what's happening is one of the things that is happening is that because now this commissioning timeline has got extended, what we are being allowed to do is to sell, the moment the plant is ready, we can sell the power into the merchant market while we await commissioning, the final commissioning approvals. And because that process can be up to a couple of months long, for those couple of months we are able to therefore get the merchant tariff rather than the PPA tariff and that, as you know, in a number of cases is almost double the PPA tariffs. So for the new projects that we are commissioning, we are actually able to realize, given this new process that has now been imposed, as I said, for good reasons, but that is also therefore allowing us to generate higher profitability for a certain period of time by selling into the merchant market.\nNikhil Nigania: Understood, very clear. Thank you so much for answering the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Clare with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nJustin Clare: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. So, first off here, you indicated that you expect to sign the PPAs for the 5.9 gigawatts of capacity that you've won at auction year-to-date in fiscal 2024, in fiscal 2025, and then the commissioning for those projects is expected in, I think, FY 2026 to 2029. I was wondering if you could give us just a little bit better sense as to when those projects might be completed. Can we expect it to be even over those years, or is it likely to be more of the capacity in fiscal 2026 and 2027? And then how should we think about the timelines for projects after you sign a PPA? And is there more time available if it's a complex project?\nSumant Sinha: Yes. Justin, hello. So, first of all, on your first question of when should these projects be commissioned? It partly depends on when the PPAs are signed and because, as you know, the clock starts ticking from that point on. And typically for complex projects, we have two years in which to execute projects. But it also, to some extent, depends on when the transmission substations will get ready, because obviously, we assume that based on the availability that is provided to us by the transmission operator that certain substations will come up at certain points in time. So we make those assumptions and we can get connectivity into those substations. Now, substations don't always necessarily come up on the time specified. Some of them do get delayed and some of them, in fact, are going to be getting ready beyond the two-year time period that we are given to commission the project, in which case the timeline for us does get extended to be aligned with the commissioning timeline of the transmission substation. So it's a little bit variable, therefore, and I hesitate to give you an answer on this. What we will do, however, Justin, is over the next few months we will, as we think through this a little bit more, and as we get more clarity on the PPA signing dates, we will be able to get a firmer estimate and we will try to share that with you, perhaps in the next earnings call a few months down the road.\nNathan Judge: Yes. Just remember Justin that those are not in our guidance or projections, right? So, as Sumant rightly mentioned, as we sign those PPAs, then we'll have more confidence in the delivery schedules, et cetera, and we'll provide more granularity around that.\nJustin Clare: Right. Okay, thanks. And then so, I guess just given the increase in the auctions that we've seen significantly more volume here, how are you thinking about your annual capacity to build? I think in the past you've talked about 2.5 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts a year. Is that the number that we should be thinking about today or is it possible that you would look to increase that number given the opportunity?\nSumant Sinha: Yes. The amount of megawatts that we can execute in a year is dependent on a few different factors. Of course, the availability of PPAs is one of those, but it also depends, as you know, on capital availability and funding capability, upon execution capability and so on. So I would say that 2.5 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts is still a fair number to assume. And of course, in a given year, it may be more than that or a little bit less than that depending on transmission. When is transmission coming up? What are the CODs like for different projects and so on? So there will be some variability around that, but that is a fair assumption to make. I think also what will happen, Justin, is that as we see the number of bids continue to stay at a high level and the attractiveness of those bids continue to be fairly good, we will try to see how we can ramp up our execution capability over time. But that is something that, as I said, we'll have to really do some work on. I think for the time being, making that assumption that the numbers that you talked about, I think is a fair assumption to make.\nJustin Clare: Okay, got it. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Puneet Gulati with HSBC. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Gulati: Yes, thank you so much for the opportunity, and congrats on good performance. My first question is on your CapEx guidance. Given the fall in module prices, are you inclined to lower your CapEx guidance or should we assume this is still a realistic number?\nSumant Sinha: Kailash, would you want to take that?\nKailash Vaswani: Sure Sumant. Yes, Puneet, so while we are likely to see some benefits accruing from that, we haven't factored that into the guidance yet, because we would like to actually realize those benefits before we bake it in.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay. And any indication of how much could that benefit be?\nKailash Vaswani: So that benefit, depending on where the prices stay while we are executing on these projects, could vary in a range and we can work it out and we can share with you basis certain assumptions.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay. Has the CapEx for the entire balance remaining capacity tied up or will that also be tied up over a period of time?\nKailash Vaswani: So, for the large part of the capacity which is currently in execution, which is the peak part, the RTC project, and the pipeline that we are executing of solar and wind projects on B2B and SECI projects, that is largely tied up, which will be a total of somewhere in the range of around 10.5 gigawatts to 11 gigawatts. For capacity beyond that, it's yet to be tied up.\nPuneet Gulati: Sorry? 10.5 gigawatts, you mean 2 gigawatt additional over the 8.5 right, that's what you meant?\nKailash Vaswani: Yes. Whatever we are currently constructing is tied up. Whatever is to be constructed in FY 2025, for that we are in the process of tying it up right now.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay. And did I hear it right that this quarter alone you might be commissioning more than a gigawatt?\nKailash Vaswani: Yes, because I think as Sumant mentioned earlier, all the capacity is fully erected and ready for commissioning. It's just waiting for some approvals and once we get that, then it will be commissioned. So of the 1.9, 800 is already commissioned and another gigawatt is ready for commissioning. It will be commissioned in the next few weeks.\nNathan Judge: Yes just Puneet as a reminder, about 1.9 gigawatts will actually be generating revenue by year end fiscal year 2024.\nPuneet Gulati: Yes, understood. And secondly, you won 5.9 gigawatt of additional projects year till date. Of these, how much PPAs have been signed so far?\nKailash Vaswani: Right now, Puneet 400 megawatt PPA is signed. That is a project with GUVNL and the rest of it is currently under discussion, yes.\nPuneet Gulati: Understood. And this is the total capacity or is it the contracted capacity?\nKailash Vaswani: This will be the RE portion of the capacity in some cases where it is RTC-2 for example, or hybrid type projects, then the contracted capacity would be lesser to that extent.\nPuneet Gulati: Understood. That's helpful. And lastly, if you can give some color on what's happening on the ALMM front, and the ministry has put it on abeyance, what does it mean for you?\nSumant Sinha: So Puneet. Hi, yes, so look, I think the government is still sort of thinking through exactly what the ALMM strategy needs to be. We had come out with an original circular which said basically that there were going to be certain exceptions, but we have now taken it back and they're still sort of mulling around what exactly they would like to have because there are obviously competing interests here. So I think, look, we just have to be patient and wait for them to finally decide what they want to do. So I can't give you any guidance unfortunately on it, but as of now, ALMM is supposed to come in from 1st April.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay. So in case no further announcement comes from the ministry, ALMM will get effective from 1st April?\nSumant Sinha: That's right, but the reality is that there will be something that will come out soon, so I think we just have to wait for it. But look, obviously, as both a developer and as a manufacturer, we are closely in touch with the government on this whole issue. Now, if they allow some relaxation of ALMM to that extent our ITP business will gain and to the extent that they don't allow that relaxation, to that extent our manufacturing side will gain. So I think we are pretty hedged on this situation at this point in time.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay. And lastly, if I may, the solar PLF this quarter is a little lower versus the last year, the same period. Is there an issue on the irradiation side this time?\nSumant Sinha: No, Puneet, I don't think we can make, come to the conclusions from just one quarter. I think we have to look at the whole year before we can come to any point of view. So I think one quarter you have these variations, frankly.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay, fair enough. That's all from my side. Thank you so much.\nSumant Sinha: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nMaheep Mandloi: Hey, good evening and good morning [indiscernible]. Thanks for the questions. Just quick housekeeping on the guidance for FY 2024. Just confirm that's mainly due to the merchant fail before final commissioning you talked about, right or is there anything else on the guidance increase here?\nSumant Sinha: On the guidance increase? Yes, I’m good. Yes. So on the guidance increase, really, as we're getting closer to the end of the fiscal year, obviously there's more visibility on what we are tracking against and given the experience that we are having on the resource side and on the expense side both, which is helping us revise the guidance as close to the reality which will actually pan out. So that is what's driven the increase in the guidance. Not really anything to do with merchant sales as of now.\nMaheep Mandloi: Any idea how to think about the incremental EBITDA generation from selling power in the merchant markets next year?\nSumant Sinha: I'm sorry, can you say that again? The line was a bit not very clear. Hello?\nMaheep Mandloi: Any hi, the line is not…\nNathan Judge: Yes, go ahead, Maheep.\nMaheep Mandloi: Sorry, yes, any guidance on how to think about merchant or the incremental EBITDA from selling power in the merchant markets next year?\nSumant Sinha: So, guidance on merchant market next year, is that the question Maheep?\nMaheep Mandloi: Yes, there's incremental EBITDA generation. You kind of talked about the opportunity to selling in the merchant markets. Right? So just trying to think through how does that impact the operations in Q4 or next year?\nSumant Sinha: Yes, so look, I think that to the extent that, so first of all, as you know, we keep our exposure to merchant somewhat within the 10% to 15% level of our total portfolio. Now, what's happening is that some of these opportunities where we are able to intermittently sort of, or initially for two or three months sell power into the merchant market before we sell it into the PPA, those are opportunities that we are trying to capitalize on wherever they occur. But since we haven't yet given you guidance for what the base case would be for next year, it's very hard to sort of give you a sense of what the extra revenue might be out of merchant for next year. I think we'll just put all that together and then give you guys some sense of all of that as we've said in the June call when we do the full year results.\nNathan Judge: And Maheep, to add a little bit to that as well, one thing that we obviously are flagging is that as we give guidance, we will want to start the year with conservative expectations. Right? So what we are saying is that there is a very -- that could be a significant opportunity, but we will likely take a more conservative view with our initial guidance there.\nMaheep Mandloi:\nMono PERC:\nSumant Sinha:\nMono PERC:\nMono PERC:\nMono PERC:\nMono PERC:\nMono PERC:\nMono PERC:\nMaheep Mandloi: Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you. [Indiscernible]\nOperator: That does conclude our Q&A session and will conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Nathan Judge of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNathan Judge: Yes. Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. This morning, we issued a press release announcing results for the fiscal 2024 second quarter ending September 30, 2023. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investor Relations section of ReNew's website at www.renew.com. With me today are Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman, and CEO; Kailash Vaswani, our newly appointed CFO, and Vaishali Nigam Sinha, Co-Founder and Chairman of Sustainability. After the prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. Please note, our safe harbor statements are contained within our press release, presentation materials and materials available on our website. These statements are important and integral to our remarks and there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. So we encourage you to review the press release we furnished in our Form 6-K and the presentation on our website for a more complete description. Also contained in our press release, presentation materials, and annual report or certain non-IFRS measures that we reconcile to the most comparable IFRS measures, and these reconciliations are also available on our website in the press release, presentation materials and on our annual report. And it is now my pleasure to hand it over to Sumant. Sumant?\nSumant Sinha: Yes, thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad to have you all in our second quarter fiscal year ended 2024. This year has presented new opportunities for us in avenues that align seamlessly with our competitive advantages. The backdrop for Indian renewable energy developers is the best we have ever seen, marked by a significant surge in power demand, shortfalls in energy supply, significant increase in auctions for renewable energy, which is the lowest cost electricity supply without subsidy, a softening of solar module prices, and a shift towards complex projects that is best served by wind, of which we are the largest developer in the country. I firmly believe that ReNew, with its disciplined approach to identifying the best return opportunities, is well positioned to capitalize on the current market. We continue to make progress towards our goals, maintaining capital discipline along the way. We are more confident of achieving our financial guidance set earlier this year, and are raising the lower end of our EBITDA guidance by approximately 3%. We now anticipate delivering between INR 62 billion to INR 66 billion in adjusted EBITDA for FY '24. We have put in a majority of our wind turbines and solar panels in our largest projects being commissioned this year, which puts us in good stead to deliver on our guidance of between 1.75 and 2.25 gigawatts of projects to be completed by this fiscal year end. We expect the additional capacity should translate to approximately 35% or more per share EBITDA growth next fiscal year. We continue to seek a consistent flow of auctions, as central agencies such as NTPC, SJVN, SECI, NHPC, and some states have announced RE auctions of 65 gigawatts this year, the highest that we have ever seen in the history of our industry. Notably, 18 gigawatts of auctions have already been completed this year, already surpassing the previous year's amount, with still about four months plus to go. A higher ratio of complex auctions signals a trend that distribution companies want specific electricity supply profiles, which require customized solutions. The complexity and limited development capabilities in India, among other things, have resulted in less participation by competitors. Broadly, we have seen an upward lift to auction tariffs for the past 12 months, and recent auctions indicate that this trend will continue further. We have signed a Power Purchase Agreement, PPA with GUVNL, which is the Gujarat Distribution Entity for 400 megawatts of capacity that we won earlier this year, and have received letters of awards for another 2.9 gigawatts that we have won. As a reminder, we do not include projects with LoAs into our portfolio until we have a contract, a signed PPA, which indicates another step up in our long-term earnings potential as the 3.1 gigawatts of projects won, receive PPAs over the next three to six months. Our assets continue to attract interest from investors and strategic partners at favorable valuations. Recently, we concluded the sale of 100 megawatts of solar assets, resulting in a gain. In a little over two years, we have raised about $565 million from asset recycling, and year-to-date about $93 million. The ability to recycle capital and deploy it in higher return opportunities remains a significant component of our capital allocation and value creation strategy. This quarter, we reported a profit after tax of US$45 million, one of the highest reported by us till date. This quarter, for the first time in a while, the wind resource was about close to normal. Wind PLF increased to 41.3% from approximately 33.7% in the corresponding quarter last year, and marked three straight years where we have seen improved wind resource, which may portend for more normal weather going forward. While we remain optimistic about long-term wind PLFs returning to normal levels, we are choosing to remain conservative at this time about our weather expectations for the remainder of this year in our guidance. Turning to Page 5, in September 2023, we witnessed a record surge in power demand, taking 240 gigawatts during peak hours, as well as a surge of power prices traded on the exchange, reflecting strong overall growth in power demand in the country. We have seen overall power demand consistently rise at 8% over the last several years and continue to expect sustained growth for the next few years. While the Indian government is ambitious about achieving the 2030 renewable energy targets, with a 50 gigawatt renewable energy annual auction calendar, our position as a market leader in developing wind remains differentiated. With a shift away from vanilla wind and solar auctions, there is a tilt towards round-the-clock and complex auctions, a significant step towards catering to unique power demand profiles of distribution companies, with wind as a key differentiator. Our experience in developing complex solutions provides us with significant advantage over others who do not yet have in-house wind EPC capability, digital or AI platforms, and strong understanding of the supply chain cycles that enable us in securing returns superior to our peer group. Turning to Page 6, while the market opportunity is substantial, our commitment to capital discipline remains unwavering. In-house wind and digital capabilities empower us to seamlessly build, operate, and maintain renewable energy projects, providing us competitive advantages in the market and enabling returns above our competitors and above our cost of capital. Recently, we signed a PPA with GUVNL at a tariff of 2.71 per kilowatt hour for 400 megawatts of solar and letters of awards - secure letters of awards for most of our 3.1 gigawatts of auctions built earlier this year at attractive tariffs. Given the increase of intermittent generation in the country, there is substantial demand for electricity supply that meets more stringent delivery and reliability requirements. More than 60% of the 37.2 gigawatts of auctions yet to be completed this year are complex power solutions. Given our industry-leading wind EPC capability, our scale, given the larger size required for complex projects, our ability to source equipment through vertical integration, our superior access to the lowest cost of capital, and our substantial land bank, we have competitive advantages in delivering these complex RE projects quicker and at a lower cost than anyone else in India. To summarize, this is therefore one of the best backdrops for Indian renewable energy that we have seen in a very, very long while. Turning to Page 7, our on-ground progress remains on track as our projects enter final construction phases. Cheaper solar module prices have enabled us to procure modules at almost half the price as compared to the same time last year. We delayed projects in the past because the then CapEx costs would have resulted in subpar IRRs. As we continue to reiterate, we remain laser-focused in capital discipline and have been rewarded by our patience. We have saved shareholders by our estimate about $100 million in lower CapEx by pushing out certain projects. We have consistently invested small amounts of capital in complementary businesses to enable even greater competitive advantages of our core renewable energy development business. For example, we spent about 10% of our CapEx to develop solar manufacturing given the substantial reductions on imports that are being imposed by the central government. This decision has borne fruit in allowing us to procure high IRR projects in recent auctions that others may not have been able to procure supply for. Investment in transmission is another example. There are currently chronic delays across India in completing interconnection hubs that allow new projects to connect to the grid. Rather than leave our large projects sitting idle, we decided to invest a small amount of capital, less than 5% of our equity, to build a transmission EPC business. Furthermore, we have recaptured most of this equity through capital recycling that, have garnered gains. We successfully commissioned our first transmission project this quarter, which is the connection point for our large peak power project, providing 138 circuit kilometers of connectivity. Before I turn it over to our newly appointed CFO, I am really pleased that the Board has chosen to promote Kailash to the CFO role. Many of you would have interacted with Kailash previously and know of his experience and extensive knowledge of renewable energy debt markets. Kailash has been with ReNew since the beginning and he joined us in 2011 as one of the founding members of the company and has been instrumental in all of our fundraising efforts, both debt and equity. To-date, he has helped ReNew raise close to $15 billion through various sources, including about $565 million raised through asset recycling. I do consider us lucky that we were able to identify someone internally for this position, who has in-depth knowledge about the business, as well as a proven track record. With that, I would like to turn it over to Kailash to go over the latest financials.\nKailash Vaswani: Thank you, Sumant. And it's my pleasure to be here and interact with all of you. Before I begin my comments on the quarter, I thought I would like to share a little about my view on my commitment to capital discipline, in which I am a staunch believer. We live within our means and only deploy capital when the returns on our investments are comfortably above our cost of capital. Having been on ReNew's investment committee for some time, I fully supported the $250 million share buyback that, was authorized in February of last year, as I saw investing in our shares as one of the most attractive investment opportunities of scale at that time. I still believe that at the current share price, there are a wide array of options that, we can use to fund growth without issuing shares. I have led all of the capital recycling efforts so far and see a significant amount of demand for our projects. I also will lead efforts, to deleverage our balance sheet over time. With regard to the veracity of our reported numbers, I fully stand behind them. Turning to Page 9, while the global markets have been impacted by rise in interest rates, we have actively managed our portfolio by refinancing our higher cost debt and ensuring our overall cost of debt, is kept within check. In India, the yield spread for Indian money debt has compressed significantly as the sector matures. We can currently raise debt for our projects at sub-9%, through large Indian financial institutions. Importantly, assuming interest rates remain where they are now, we expect to be able to refinance debt maturing of $850 million over the next several years at a lower interest rate, saving an average of 25 to 50 basis points. We have significant access to debt from diversified sources, including from PFC and REC, which is the Power Finance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Corporation, which are known to provide one of the most competitive cost of project debt in the industry. We recently signed an MOU of $8 billion with them. We continue to expect that we will be able to effectively manage our interest costs and ensure that project IRRs remain within the targeted range. Turning to Page 10, our asset recycling program continues to see interest from international players seeking an offset to their carbon footprint. We believe that asset recycling will effectively provide us with a long-term advantage by helping us scale at faster pace, as well as provides us avenues to optimize the build process and enhance returns on invested capital. We completed a sale of 100 megawatt of solar assets in the current period and raised almost US$93 million through asset recycling year-to-date, about $565 million in aggregate. For growth beyond the current pipeline, we expect that we have operational development capability to be able to build about 2.5 to 3 gigawatt of assets annually, of which we intend to recycle assets, including sale of farm downs of net interest of about 1 to 1.5 gigawatts each year, which would generate the required cash flow to fund growth in addition to our internal sources. This would ensure we have sufficient equity for growth without having to issue shares. Turning to Page 11, we are pleased to report our highest quarterly profit after tax of US$45 million and the highest first half year profit after tax of US$81 million till date. We saw a return to normal wind patterns, during the current period and the wind PLF during the quarter was 41.3%, compared to 32.7% in the same quarter last year. And we continue to remain cautiously optimistic about recovery in the long-term wind PLF towards the long-term normal levels. Our operating capacity increased by approximately 600 megawatts over the last comparable quarter in the prior year, an increase of about 8%. For the full year, we expect interest cost to be marginally higher, to the prior year on account of new project commissioning and the same is, offset by savings and interest rates from refinancing. Of course, this is subject to volatility in the foreign exchange market. Taxes look to be about 20% to 25% higher in FY '24 as more of our subsidiaries are turning profitable. Turning to Page 12, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of US$256 million for Q2 FY '24. The higher EBITDA is primarily attributable to additional revenue from projects commissioned during the period, higher wind PLFs offset by lower late payment surcharges, of about $11 million as more of our customers are paying on time and higher operating costs reflecting more headcount to support our growth. Turning to Page 13, our DSO continues to improve year-on-year and we have seen an improvement of 119 days since September '22, an improvement of 26 days since the beginning of this fiscal year. We continue to work with states and continue to believe that our DSO will continue to improve over time, as we continue to focus on getting paid for overdue receivables as well as a favorable mixed shift, where more of our revenues come from central government and corporate customers who pay on time. Moving to Page 14, we are focused on improving our liquidity and leverage. Our cash balance stood at close to $1 billion, almost US$985 million and our net debt on operating assets was US$4.7 billion. Off gross debt, about 59% of our debt has a fixed interest rate. We only have about US$325 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months, which we expect to refinance at an average lower rate than, what we are currently paying. We have good visibility on how we anticipate refinancing, the remaining 600 odd million that matures in FY '25 and FY '26. With that, I would like to turn it over to Vaishali to talk about our ESG initiatives.\nVaishali Nigam Sinha: Thank you, Kailash. Turning to Page 16, building upon the momentum from the previous year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to establish new benchmarks across all aspects of our ESG vision, performance and transparency. We are leading the way for ESG in our sector. ReNew has released a sustainability report for fiscal year 2022-23 titled Driving Decarbonization. The report is aligned with GRI, SASB and TCFD and externally assured by DNV. Some of the key highlights of the report are, ReNew has generated clean electricity, which is 17,386 gigawatt hours, which is enough to power nearly 5 million Indian households. It has also helped to avoid 14 million tons of carbon emissions, through its operations, which is about 0.5% of India's total emissions. The carbon intensity of ReNew's electricity generation is about 92% less than the Indian power sector's average. ReNew saves about 318,708 kiloliters of water, about 48% year-on-year increase through our robotic cleaning and condition-based monitoring system. ReNew achieves carbon neutral status for the third consecutive year for a Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. I've mentioned earlier as well, the net zero targets for 2014 were validated by SBTi and entails reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all scopes by 29.4% in 2027 and by 90% by 2040. Two, clean energy procurement for operations, electrification of fossil fuel based equipment, encouraging suppliers to set SBTi aligned targets, low carbon footprint raw materials and green logistics for transportation. So as you can tell, we are deeply committed. Social responsibility continues to remain an integral part of our business. Our CFe journey which began in 2014 and since then we have impacted the lives of over 1 million people across 500 plus villages in India, spanning across 10 states in the remotest parts of our country. Now, if you could turn to Page 17, I would like to switch to specifics of some of our efforts for first half of fiscal year 2024. Lighting Lives, which is one of our flagship programs is an initiative where we electrify schools with less than three hours of electricity using solar off-grid. Electrification of 50 schools and we have also established 50 digital learning centers and all of this is in progress and going well. Climate curriculum, we are in the process of rolling out the climate curriculum to about 9,000 students across the country. Women4Climate is another program we are very passionate about. It is our effort to include more and more women in the energy sector and we have programs on green skilling in partnership with UN organizations and we are also working on re-skilling some of the salt pan workers in Gujarat to becoming now solar technicians. Nearly 60 women salt pan farmers have been trained and have secured employment. About 48 trainees have secured employment. Employee engagement is an important part of what we do. We have programs designed for and led by employees at ReNew annual volunteering campaign, which is the right bucket challenge for about 40,000 kgs of rice distributed pan India. We have kick started the fiscal year 2024 disclosure cycle with the submission of CPP Climate Change 2023 disclosure. We will be disclosing further progress in our forthcoming sustainability report. With this, let me hand it back to Sumant to talk about our annual guidance.\nSumant Sinha: Thank you, Vaishali. Turning to our annual guidance, I am happy to report that we have increased the bottom end of our FY '24 adjusted EBITDA guidance by INR 2 billion to INR 62 billion to INR 66 billion on account of a better than expected H1 performance. We have provided some additional details on how results were compared to our original guidance in the appendix of this earnings presentation. We reiterate our capacity of completed guidance for this fiscal year of between 1.75 to 2.25 gigawatts. Regarding our buyback, we have repurchased by now 38.6 million shares in total since February last year, which represent approximately 35% of the free float at the time of listing. We have $11 million of authorization remaining, which represents about 4% to 5% of the total free float. With that, we will be happy to take any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Puneet Gulati from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Gulati: Yes, thank you so much and congratulations on good numbers and good profitability as well. My first question is on the win PLF. So this quarter has been particularly good at 42% PLF. Should one consider this to be normal for 2Q or do you think it was higher than the normal?\nSumant Sinha: Yes, Puneet. Hi, thank you. This year's PLF in Q2 was a little bit, but very marginally, I would say higher than what would be normal. But keep in mind that Q1 is actually significantly lower as well. So, in aggregate, Q1 and Q2 put together is lower than what should have been the case.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay, understood. So, first half is normal, but Q2 higher, Q1 lower\nSumant Sinha: Yes, first half is a little bit less than normal, but Q2 is a little bit higher than normal and Q2 was lower. And so, therefore, overall we are ending up a little bit lower than the overall H1 expectation would have been.\nPuneet Gulati: Understood. And secondly, can you also update on one of the acquisitions that you announced a few quarters back? What is the progress there?\nSumant Sinha: Yes, I'll let Kailash do that.\nKailash Vaswani: Yes, Puneet. So, on the acquisition that we had announced, there was a lot of delay which happened in getting the approvals because those assets were sitting in a partnership firm and they had to demerge it into a company and the approvals for that demerger took a lot of time. So, that deal reached a long-stop date and we decided we didn't want it because the entire market had sort of taken so much time for this process to get completed that we don't want to wait any longer and we got better opportunities on the bidding side. So, we decided to allocate capital more on the organic front.\nPuneet Gulati: Understood. And there were no penalties that we had to pay for that?\nKailash Vaswani: No, no penalties. There were some transaction costs which were involved, initial cost which was less than a $1 million. That was your total cost that we ended up incurring on it.\nPuneet Gulati: Okay. And secondly, Sumant, you announced in this year, a lot of bids have been announced, tendering has happened, some PPAs being signed. Do you have a similar number for FY '23? What kind of bids got announced and how much PPAs have been signed and what is the backlog for that?\nSumant Sinha: So, FY '23, so you know, Puneet, it's very hard for me to give a number because FY '23, we actually hardly won any capacity. We just had a 3% market share last year. And - but I should tell you that our SECI 8 solar which is the outstanding, which in fact we haven't put anywhere in the presentation, but therefore, Nathan, you have to tell me whether I can talk about that or not.\nNathan Judge: Yes, go ahead, Sumant.\nSumant Sinha: Okay. So, the SECI 8, which was an outstanding 200 megawatts, that PPA has also got signed now. So, of the 13.7 or 8 that we now have, everything is fully signed PPAs. So, there's nothing that is now not signed. So, the only point I'm trying to make is that old PPAs are now getting converted quite rapidly. And with power demand going up, there is definitely interest among the discounts to go to SECI and try to convert some of the options into firm PPAs. But you know, Puneet, the process is a long one because the distribution utilities have to first, of course, go to the commercial implication. Then they have to go to their local regulator and get the approval of the tariff. That process itself can take a month or two. Then they come back to the SECI and then basically go ahead and sign the PPA. After that, SECI signs the PPA balance. So, that whole process can take several months to get consummated. And in auctions where there is a central acquirer, they have to go to the central regulatory authority. So, for example, a couple of bids that we won back in April-May are now sitting with the central regulator, CERC, for approval. And it's just a process, frankly speaking. It just takes a little bit of time. And so, the process of conversion of these bids to PPAs is happening within the works. And I think progressively, as some of these approvals from the regulators come through, you'll see some of that getting announced.\nPuneet Gulati: And in your reasonable expectation of the 2.9 left, how many of them should you see PPAs getting signed this year itself?\nSumant Sinha: I would imagine that most of them should -- \nPuneet Gulati: I'm sure it's hard to say.\nSumant Sinha: Yes, it's hard to say, but actually I would imagine most of them should get signed. Certainly, some of the more plain vanilla ones should. But then, of course, there is also some complex auctions. Complex auctions, as you know, does require a longer lead time to convert to PPAs, simply because they are, by definition, complex. And therefore, this storm will also take a longer time to understand them and then be able to get their own internal approvals. And then also to that extent, regulators take longer to understand them. So, the whole process of conversion of complex auctions is just a little bit longer. But, you know, the reality is that for us, there is no urgency at all right now on some of these, because for the capacity that we've won, these are things that we're going to construct only in FY '26. And so, you know, we have time on our side to get them signed. Meanwhile, I should tell you that for all the projects that we've got LoAs, we've already blocked transmission capacity. So, transmission capacity has been blocked. Land, we have, obviously, we're working on that right now. But eventually, we will convert them into actual, sort of deals when the PPAs do get signed as we go forward. And keep in mind that our clock to execute starts ticking only once the PPAs are signed.\nPuneet Gulati: Right. But you have land for the entire 3.5, which is one good thing.\nSumant Sinha: Yes. I mean, we don't have to acquire it right now as long as we have good line of sight into where that land is. In some cases, you can block the land without actually paying any real significant amount of money. But the important thing is as long as you block the transmission capacity, then, you know, that's the most critical factor. And with the LoAs in hand, we are, in fact, able to block the transmission capacity. And so for all the capacities that we have, all the 3.1 gigawatts that we run, we have blocked the transmission capacity for all of that.\nPuneet Gulati: Understood. That's very helpful. And lastly, any progress on asset recycling? Anything that you did in Q2 and what's out there for the second half?\nSumant Sinha: Yes, Kailash, can you take that?\nKailash Vaswani: Yes. So, we have consummated transactions of almost around $93 million till date. And we are working on a few in the pipeline. But the timing on asset sales is, you know, really hard to say because when the deals get done, so how much will get done in Q3 versus Q4, we are working towards it.\nPuneet Gulati: And $93 million would include the Gentari acquisition and its results?\nKailash Vaswani: That's right. It includes the two deals or three deals rather. It's the Gentari deal, the 100 megawatt sale to [Technip Solar], and the third one is the amount that we got from [Northland solar transmission assets].\nPuneet Gulati: Okay. Understood. That's everything. Thank you so much and all the best.\nKailash Vaswani: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Clare from ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nJustin Clare: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking our questions there. So I want to ask just about the amount of capacity here. So there's, it seems a significantly larger opportunity for renewable projects here in terms of the auctions that are expected annually. So I was wondering if you could speak to the potential for bottlenecks to emerge given the larger volume of capacity. And then, maybe you could speak to your strategy in managing those potential bottlenecks.\nSumant Sinha: Justin, thank you so much for the question. But, you know, you asked me a question that I can spend many hours discussing with you as you can imagine because this is obviously essential to our business. But just to give you a very quick sense of that, I think the key issues that are required for executing a project, of course, are PPAs, which as we discussed, there's ample opportunity for us to win capacities there. The second is transmission. And that is not a limiting factor right now because the government is building transmission capacity quite at quite rapid pace. And as I said, once we win an LoA or we win a bid and get the LoA, then we're able to block the transmission capacity. And if there is no transmission capacity available, then the execution timelines are automatically moved forward. So transmission does not become therefore a problem for us to rule out and it should not become. The third is land. Land, of course, we're working on constantly and we're always trying to look at what is the forward pipeline and we're trying to block land for three years out, four years out projects. And we're also obviously putting up a number of net marks in different parts of the country. We have several hundred net marks that are now up and running to measure wind. And in solar, we have blocked by three - by a number of mechanisms transmission capacity in the state of Rajasthan, which allows us to execute projects even for two, three years beyond our existing pipelines. So, there is a lot of land available in Rajasthan for solar projects. So land is handled on that basis. And then, of course, there's the issue of people and organization. That is something that, you know, we have our own in-house capability of execution in both wind and solar. And that is something that we constantly re-evaluate and we are looking at scaling that up. But slowly, because obviously we want to build an organization that, is high quality and that execution capacity should be sustainably improving rather than, just sort of going up on a one-time basis. And then, of course, there is the issue of capital. And capital, I think we are looking at between a mix of internal capital and asset recycling to raise capital for funding some of these projects. So, I think that's how we're looking at these five key areas. The sixth actually is supply chain. And there, obviously, we have as the largest wind player in the country, very key relationships with the important OEMs, which go out a few years. And so - and we get, you know, best terms from these wind OEMs, because we are in fact the largest buyer of wind turbines in the country. And as far as solar is concerned - as I've discussed multiple times with all of you, that's an area where government policy is evolving and changing. And therefore, we have tried to - stay one step ahead of government policy by making sure that we have invested as much as we need to have that security of supply. And that, therefore, also allows us to keep bidding with a high degree of confidence around being able to source and procure our own modules. And that's actually becoming a significant competitive advantage. So that's - those are some of the issues that we are working on to make sure that we're able to continue to execute, you know, two to three, and then sort of we go up to a year, and then try to increase that - in years down the road. I hope that answers your question.\nJustin Clare: Got it. Okay. Yes, no, very helpful. And then I guess just on the supply chain, you have your own in-house module manufacturing today. I was wondering if you could share what the cost structure was for the modules that you're producing in-house, and how that might compare, to what's available in the market, including the cost of the import duty, and how this might give you a relative advantage in terms of your cost structure?\nSumant Sinha: Yes. Nathan, we haven't come out with those numbers right now, right? But please reconfirm.\nNathan Judge: No, not just yet. But I mean, if you want to give some ranges, that's fine.\nSumant Sinha: Okay. Thank you. So yes, Justin, the thing is that, as you know, import duties in India for solar modules are about 40%. And that gives us sufficient protection against imported modules. The cost differential between what we produce in India and what is produced in China - as just for the module, in our estimation is about 10% to 15%. And so, the 40% protection is sufficient to allow us to not have that as an issue for us. The second thing is keep in mind that from - that way we also have the approved list of modules in manufacturers, which is really a hard barrier to import, which the government had imposed from this April, but had deferred it for a year. And it is coming back in April of next year, which will then prevent any imports from coming in at all, notwithstanding any duties and everything else. And so at that point, it will not even just become a cost issue. It will become an availability issue, because anybody who has access to modules, will be able to continue to execute projects, and people who don't obviously will not be able to. Our sense is that module supply next year will be in deficit, because obviously while capacity is coming up, it does take time to essentially get it to a level, where people have good quality, and stable production in place. Having said that, our sense also is, although there is no specific data that is there that allows us to point to, but just based on people that are working with us and so on, our cost of production is very competitive among other Indian companies. So that is really also something that we would like to benchmark ourselves to.\nJustin Clare: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nSumant Sinha: Thank you.\nNathan Judge: And Samant, there is actually an inbound email question from Girish [ph] at Morgan Stanley that, is related to that. So if I could just ask this. Basically, are we open to selling a minority stake in our solar manufacturing? And there seems to be an overcapacity coming online in India and given strong response to PLI. What are our thoughts about those?\nSumant Sinha: Yes. So, no, we certainly are open. We're not willing to keeping a 100% of the solar plant. As we stated many times, the reason that we set it up is, to assure ourselves of supply security. And as long as we're able to do that, we are, you know, that meets our primary objective. As far as overcapacity is concerned in the Indian market, that is something that we'll have to wait and see, because obviously while there are a lot of people who have announced plans, how many of those actually rectify, we will have to monitor. And the second thing is also that a lot of the earlier capacities that, have been set up are actually going to become uncompetitive, because they just won't have either the efficiency, the production or the ability to make the latest generation of modules. So to some extent, some of the earlier capacities will have to be discounted in the calculation of the capacities that are coming up. Yes. So that's my response on that, Nathan.\nNathan Judge: Thank you. Jason, go ahead to the next question. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from…\nSumant Sinha: Actually, if I could just add…\nNathan Judge: Yes Sumant, go ahead. Go ahead Sumant, go and finish your thought.\nSumant Sinha: Okay. Yes. No, no. The only other thing I would say is that also keep in mind that a lot of the modules are being exported, shipped out of India to the U.S. and other places. And so that also adds to the deficit - and will add to the deficit in the country next year.\nNathan Judge: Go ahead, Jason. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. And our next question comes from Nikhil Nigania from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nNikhil Nigania: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on a good set of numbers. My first question is regarding the RTC and Peak Power projects. Good to see their guidance being maintained. But just wanted to clarify that transmission is not a bottleneck for these two assets, when they're commissioned in Q4, power evacuations and the grid evacuations will start happening.\nSumant Sinha: One, Nikhil, I can categorically confirm that to you, that transmission is not a bottleneck. Largely, because we are actually building a lot of it ourselves. The very first project opting in RTC, there are three different wind projects and one solar project. The first wind project was making to a substation that we ourselves are making. And that we have now commissioned and - that has been charged. And so therefore, we just waiting - going through the connectivity protocols now to connect the first project into that [Koppal] substation - that we did. The second one also we are building, actually, which is another substation. And so therefore, obviously, we have clear understanding and control of when the substations are coming up. The third one is getting connected to a substation that has been made by our third-party, which we are closely monitoring and we are in touch with them. And that also looks like it's on track. So that should not lead to any problems either. So I don't anticipate any transmission related issues in commissioning these projects.\nNikhil Nigania: Okay. Good to hear that. I think a related question then is transmission. I think a point slightly alluded to during the discussion earlier. Is transmission being seen as a constraint India ramping up to 30, 40 gigs of renewable installation now? Are you seeing that as a constraint in reaching that higher renewable installation numbers probably?\nSumant Sinha: I would say the government has been so far quite proactive in building on transmission capacity. And I think a lot of transmission capacity exists in the country that can allow for the 50 gigawatts of commissioning. The only thing is, of course, that the transmission capacity is not necessarily areas that people would want to set up or maybe there's some constraint in places like Rajasthan or Karnataka and so on. And there, there might be bottlenecks as we go forward. But when I say bottlenecks, I mean that the bottleneck will emerge after 30 gigawatts or 40 gigawatts of connectivity rather than 10 or 15 gigawatts. So there is a lot of room to go before we actually start having constraints really, really emerge. So I would say that at least for the next two, three years, we should not be seeing any transmission bottlenecks. And the government is, as you very well know, trying to really speed up the construction of transmission projects and the auctioning of transmission projects. So they are very closely evaluating what the issues are and are trying to debottleneck that.\nNikhil Nigania: Got it. Thank you. And my last question then is, there was this one big tender, the RTC-2 tender, I think for more than 2 gigawatts, which I think has been going around for quite some time. Any update that could be shared on that from the news side?\nSumant Sinha: I'm not sure which tender you're specifically talking about. There's one. There's RTC-2?\nNikhil Nigania: Yes. The one that coal was also not to be blended, coal-fired generation.\nSumant Sinha: Okay, okay, okay. No, listen, I haven't heard about that tender for quite some time. So I'm not sure that it is live right now. But as you know, in the meantime, a number of other RTC auctions have happened. [Techie 6] was the first one that happened. That is for 200 megawatts of headline capacity, which, as you know, translates to about 3.5 gigawatts of actual RTC capacity. Then SJVN just recently did another 200 megawatts capacity, which is not actually fully subscribed to, in which we've done 184 megawatts. And then there's the REMCL tender as well. So there have been three such tenders in the last few months. And as you know, a number more are due to be coming up in the next few months.\nNikhil Nigania: Got it. Got it. Thanks. Thank you so much. Those are my questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So just two simple questions. One, you do lots of capital recycling and existing and future projects. And so I'm just wondering if the gains that you record on that are reflected in your EBITDA. So that's number one. And number two is, when you show us EBITDA and debt projections, just wanted to make sure that this is proportional EBITDA and proportional net debt, meaning the portion of both that you keep as renewed net of those divestitures or asset recyclings.\nSumant Sinha: Yes. Kailash?\nKailash Vaswani: Sure. Yes. So the gains on the asset sales have not been reflected in the EBITDA line as of now. I think the accounting transaction happened subsequent to the end of the previous quarter. So that's the reason why I think it will get accounted in the subsequent period. To your second point, where we consolidate the full EBITDA, where we own 51% majority of the assets, there the full debt also gets consolidated with us into the balance sheet. So we don't consolidate on a proportional basis because if we are in control of the asset, then the entire EBITDA and debt sort of stays with us. We take out the minority interest on account of the joint venture partners' interest in the project.\nAngie Storozynski: I understand, but I'm just asking you - yes.\nNathan Judge: Yes. Sorry. Just to clarify, on our guidance that you see there, that is just our net. So if you look at the debt - \nAngie Storozynski: So it is net of minority interest.\nNathan Judge: Yes. So those are actually net to shareholders.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay.\nNathan Judge: So, I mean, so - but as far as - yes. Actually, we're recording. We would be taking out the net or the minority position in the minority interest line. But as a projection and our guidance is concerned, it's all net of what we currently own.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. That's good. And then just going back to the gains on capital recycling. So, again, I mean, you've done a couple of those transactions in the past. And I'm just wondering, I mean, have those been a meaningful contributor to the EBITDA? I understand the difference in the timing of recognition of the gain for this latest transaction. But I'm just wondering how big of a component of EBITDA this has been or can be. Again, just I know that that's an ongoing business. But I'm, again, wondering how big of a position of the EBITDA this is.\nSumant Sinha: So, see, again, there's an accounting value to it. What tends to happen is that we book costs basis and accounting calculation on the capital expenditure. We're also going to put some margins at the EPC levels. When we consolidate them, they get knocked off. When we sell those assets, those assets are marked at a higher value in our books because of the - because we are sort of selling those assets. So to that extent, the gains are smaller, but the cash flow impact is larger.\nNathan Judge: Okay. So if the gains are not very material. And also remember that most of the larger transactions were related to projects that are under construction. Right? So our Peak Power and our RTC projects, right. And those gains would be, well, commercial gains, but accounting gains are de minimis because they haven't been actually selling of operating assets. That's where you would see gains. So, so far, there's not been much.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then lastly, and again, by now you probably see where I'm going with this. I'm trying to compare you to other renewable power developers. There's been some differences in how, you know, that's, and EBITDA are shown. So, you know, you guys do project financing and I'm just wondering if there is any reasons for your - for you to change that stance. Like, I don't know, as the balance sheet grows, would you consider balance sheet financing? Again, any, any changes in how you finance a new build?\nSumant Sinha: Yes. So again, there, what happens is that, you know, obviously we have an existing portfolio, which is quite sizable. We have existing debt, which is quite sizable. So to change everything to balance sheet, it will take time, and it requires a certain type of market environment, which is relatively easy money policy type of market where the rates are lower. In which market you can obviously get transactions done by getting borrowing balance sheet. And then repaying the debt at the core levels. But given that market conditions are what they are, investors are very focused on getting security on specified assets. And then the lenders typically wouldn't want to consolidate or have in their entities where they hold the security under construction risk. Because then the risk weightage is for them also changes. So we are not moving to a balance sheet type of financing anytime soon. For us, this model really works. And most of the Indian context, the lenders are project finance lenders with specific assets. And they want the full security of that asset without sharing it with any other lenders. So from a bankruptcy remoteness point of view also, that is the preferred model in India. So it seems like we'll have to sort of continue with that.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
